        "Content": "Misconfigured Docker API instances have become the target of a new malware campaign that transforms them into a cryptocurrency mining botnet.\nThe attacks, designed to mine for Dero currency, is notable for its worm-like capabilities to propagate the malware to other exposed Docker instances and rope them into an ever-growing horde of mining bots.\nKaspersky said it observed an unidentified threat actor gaining initial access to a running containerized infrastructure by exploiting an insecurely published Docker API, and then weaponizing that access to create the illicit cryptojacking network.\n\"This led to the running containers being compromised and new ones being created not only to hijack the victim's resources for cryptocurrency mining but also to launch external attacks to propagate to other networks,\" security researcher Amged Wageh\nsaid\n.\nThe attack chain is realized through two components: A propagation malware \"nginx\" that scans the internet for exposed Docker APIs and the \"cloud\" Dero cryptocurrency miner. Both the payloads are developed using Golang. The use of \"nginx\" is a deliberate attempt to masquerade as the legitimate nginx web server and fly under the radar.\nThe propagation malware is designed to record the running activities of the malware, launch the miner, and enter into an infinite loop to generate random IPv4 network subnets for flagging more susceptible Docker instances that have the default API port 2375 open and compromising them.\nIt then proceeds to check whether the remote dockerd daemon on the host with a matching IPv4 is running and responsive. If it fails to execute the \"docker -H PS\" command, \"nginx\" simply moves to the next IP address from the list.\n\"After confirming that the remote dockerd daemon is running and responsive, nginx generates a container name with 12 random characters and uses it to create a malicious container on the remote target,\" Wageh explained. \"Then nginx prepares the new container to install dependencies later by updating the packages via 'docker -H exec apt-get -yq update.'\"\nThe propagation tool then installs masscan and docker.io in the container so as to allow the malware to interact with the Docker daemon and to perform the external scan to infect other networks, effectively spreading the malware further. In the last stage, the two payloads \"nginx\" and \"cloud\" are transferred to the container using the command \"docker -H cp -L /usr/bin/ :/usr/bin.\"\nAs a way of setting up persistence, the transferred \"nginx\" binary is added to the \"/root/.bash_aliases\" file to make sure that it automatically launches upon shell login. Another significant aspect of the malware is that it's also engineered to infect Ubuntu-based running containers on remote vulnerable hosts.\nThe ultimate goal of the campaign is to execute the Dero cryptocurrency miner, which is based on the open-source DeroHE CLI miner available on GitHub.\nKaspersky has assessed that the activity overlaps with a Dero mining campaign that was\npreviously documented\nby CrowdStrike in March 2023 targeting Kubernetes clusters based on the wallet address and derod node addresses used. A subsequent iteration of the same campaign was\nflagged\nby Wiz in June 2024.\n\"Containerized environments were compromised through a combination of a previously known miner and a new sample that created malicious containers and infected existing ones,\" Wageh said. \"The two malicious implants spread without a C2 server, making any network that has a containerized infrastructure and insecurely published Docker API to the internet a potential target.\"\nThe development comes as the AhnLab Security Intelligence Center (ASEC) detailed a campaign that involves the deployment of the Monero coin miner along with a never-before-seen backdoor that uses the\nPyBitmessage\npeer-to-peer (P2P) communication protocol to process incoming instructions and execute them as PowerShell scripts.\nThe exact distribution method used in the campaign is currently not known, but it's suspected to be disguised as cracked versions of popular software, making it essential that users avoid downloading files from unknown or untrusted sources and stick to legitimate distribution channels.\n\"The Bitmessage protocol is a messaging system designed with anonymity and decentralization in mind, and it features the prevention of interception by intermediaries and the anonymization of message senders and receivers,\" ASEC\nsaid\n.\n\"Threat actors exploited the PyBitmessage module, which implements this protocol in the Python environment, to exchange encrypted packets in a format similar to regular web traffic. In particular, C2 commands and control messages are hidden within messages from real users in the Bitmessage network.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new malicious campaign that uses a fake website advertising antivirus software from Bitdefender to dupe victims into downloading a remote access trojan called Venom RAT.\nThe campaign indicates a \"clear intent to target individuals for financial gain by compromising their credentials, crypto wallets, and potentially selling access to their systems,\" the DomainTools Intelligence (DTI) team\nsaid\nin a new report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe website in question, \"bitdefender-download[.]com,\" advertises site visitors to download a Windows version of the Antivirus software. Clicking on the prominent \"Download for Windows\" button initiates a file download from a Bitbucket repository that redirects to an Amazon S3 bucket. The Bitbucket account is no longer active.\nThe ZIP archive (\"BitDefender.zip\") contains an executable called \"StoreInstaller.exe,\" which includes malware configurations associated with Venom RAT, as well as code related to the open-source post-exploitation framework SilentTrinity and\nStormKitty\nstealer.\nVenom RAT\nis an offshoot of Quasar RAT that comes with capabilities to harvest data and provide persistent remote access to attackers.\nDomainTools said the decoy website masquerading as Bitdefender shares temporal and infrastructure overlaps with other malicious domains spoofing banks and generic IT services that have been used as part of phishing activity to harvest login credentials associated with Royal Bank of Canada and Microsoft .\n\"These tools work in concert: Venom RAT sneaks in, StormKitty grabs your passwords and digital wallet info, and SilentTrinity ensures the attacker can stay hidden and maintain control,\" the company said.\n\"This campaign underscores a constant trend: attackers are using sophisticated, modular malware built from open-source components. This \"build-your-own-malware\" approach makes these attacks more efficient, stealthy, and adaptable.\"\nThe disclosure comes as Sucuri warned of a\nClickFix\n-style campaign that employs bogus Google Meet pages to deceive users into installing noanti-vm.bat RAT, a heavily obfuscated Windows batch script that grants remote control over the victim's computer.\n\"This fake Google Meet page doesn't present a login form to steal credentials directly,\" security researcher Puja Srivastava\nsaid\n. \"Instead, it employs a social engineering tactic, presenting a fake 'Microphone Permission Denied' error and urging the user to copy and paste a specific PowerShell command as a 'fix.'\"\nIt also follows a spike in phishing attacks that exploit Google's AppSheet no-code development platform to mount a highly targeted, sophisticated campaign impersonating Meta.\n\"Utilizing state-of-the-art tactics such as polymorphic identifiers, advanced man‑in‑the‑middle proxy mechanisms and multi-factor authentication bypass techniques, the attackers aim to harvest credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, enabling real-time access to social media accounts,\" the KnowBe4 Threat Lab\nsaid\nin a report.\nThe campaign entails the use of AppSheet to deliver phishing emails at scale, allowing the threat actors to bypass email security defenses such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC owing to the fact that the messages originate from a valid domain (\"noreply@appsheet[.]com\").\nFurthermore, the emails claim to be from Facebook Support and employ account deletion warnings to trick users into clicking on fake links under the pretext of submitting an appeal within a 24-hour time period. The booby-trapped links lead victims to an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing page designed to harvest their credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes.\n\"To further evade detection and complicate remediation, the attackers leverage AppSheets' functionality for generating unique IDs, shown as Case IDs in the body of the email,\" the company said.\n\"The presence of unique polymorphic identifiers in each phishing email ensures every message is slightly different, helping them bypass traditional detection systems that rely on static indicators such as hashes or known malicious URLs.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Microsoft has shed light on a previously undocumented cluster of malicious activity originating from a Russia-affiliated threat actor dubbed\nVoid Blizzard\n(aka Laundry Bear) that it said is attributed to \"worldwide cloud abuse.\"\nActive since at least April 2024, the hacking group is linked to espionage operations mainly targeting organizations that are important to Russian government objectives, including those in government, defense, transportation, media, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and healthcare sectors in Europe and North America.\n\"They often use stolen sign-in details that they likely buy from online marketplaces to gain access to organizations,\" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team\nsaid\nin a report published today. \"Once inside, they steal large amounts of emails and files.\"\nAttacks mounted by Void Blizzard have been found to disproportionately single out NATO member states and Ukraine, suggesting that the adversary is looking to collect intelligence to further Russian strategic objectives.\nSpecifically, the threat actor is known to target government organizations and law enforcement agencies in NATO member states and countries that provide direct military or humanitarian support to Ukraine. It's also said to have staged successful attacks aimed at education, transportation, and defense verticals in Ukraine.\nThis includes the October 2024 compromise of several user accounts belonging to a Ukrainian aviation organization that had been previously targeted by\nSeashell Blizzard\n, a threat actor tied to the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), in 2022.\nThe attacks are characterized as opportunistic and targeted high-volume efforts that are engineered to breach targets deemed of value to the Russian government. Initial access methods comprise unsophisticated techniques like password spraying and stolen authentication credentials.\nIn some of the campaigns, the threat actor has utilized stolen credentials likely sourced from commodity information stealer logs available on the cybercrime underground to access Exchange and SharePoint Online and harvest email and files from compromised organizations.\n\"The threat actor has also in some cases enumerated the compromised organization's Microsoft Entra ID configuration using the publicly available AzureHound tool to gain information about the users, roles, groups, applications, and devices belonging to that tenant,\" Microsoft said.\nAs recently as last month, the Windows maker said it observed the hacking crew shifting to \"more direct methods\" to steal passwords, such as sending spear-phishing emails that are engineered to trick victims into parting with their login information by means of an adversary-in-the-middle (\nAitM\n) landing pages.\nThe activity entails the use of a typosquatted domain to impersonate the Microsoft Entra authentication portal to target over 20 NGOs in Europe and the United States. The email messages claimed to be from an organizer from the European Defense and Security Summit and contained a PDF attachment with fake invitations to the summit.\nPresent wishing the PDF document is a malicious QR code that redirects to an attacker-controlled domain (\"micsrosoftonline[.]com\") that hosts a credential phishing page. It's believed that the phishing page is based on the open-source\nEvilginx\nphishing kit.\nPost-compromise actions after gaining initial access encompass the abuse of Exchange Online and Microsoft Graph to enumerate users' mailboxes and cloud-hosted files, and then make use of automation to facilitate bulk data collection. In select instances, the threat actors are also said to have accessed Microsoft Teams conversations and messages via the web client application.\n\"Many of the compromised organizations overlap with past – or, in some cases, concurrent – targeting by other well-known Russian state actors, including\nForest Blizzard\n,\nMidnight Blizzard\n, and\nSecret Blizzard\n,\" Microsoft said. \"This intersection suggests shared espionage and intelligence collection interests assigned to the parent organizations of these threat actors.\"\nVoid Blizzard Linked to September Breach of Dutch Police Agency\nIn a separate advisory, the Netherlands Defence Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) attributed Void Blizzard to a September 23, 2024, breach of a Dutch police employee account via a pass-the-cookie attack, stating work-related contact information of police employees was obtained by the threat actor.\nPass-the-cookie attack refers to a scenario where an attacker uses stolen cookies obtained via information stealer malware to sign in to accounts without having to enter a username and password. It's currently not known what other information was stolen, although it's highly likely that other Dutch organisations were also targeted.\n\"Laundry Bear is looking for information about the purchase and production of military equipment by Western governments and Western supplies of weapons to Ukraine,\"\nsaid\nMIVD director, Vice Admiral Peter Reesink, in a statement.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Artificial intelligence is driving a massive shift in enterprise productivity, from GitHub Copilot's code completions to chatbots that mine internal knowledge bases for instant answers. Each new agent must authenticate to other services, quietly swelling the population of non‑human identities (NHIs) across corporate clouds.\nThat population is already overwhelming the enterprise: many companies now juggle at least\n45 machine identities for every human user\n. Service accounts, CI/CD bots, containers, and AI agents all need secrets, most commonly in the form of API keys, tokens, or certificates, to connect securely to other systems to do their work.\nGitGuardian's State of Secrets Sprawl 2025 report\nreveals the cost of this sprawl: over\n23.7 million secrets\nsurfaced on public GitHub in 2024 alone. And instead of making the situation better, repositories with Copilot enabled the leak of secrets\n40 percent more often\n.\nNHIs Are Not People\nUnlike human beings logging into systems, NHIs rarely have any policies to mandate rotation of credentials, tightly scope permissions, or decommission unused accounts. Left unmanaged, they weave a dense, opaque web of high‑risk connections that attackers can exploit long after anyone remembers those secrets exist.\nThe adoption of AI, especially large language models and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n, has dramatically increased the speed and volume at which this risk-inducing sprawl can occur.\nConsider an internal support chatbot powered by an LLM. When asked how to connect to a development environment, the bot might retrieve a Confluence page containing valid credentials. The chatbot can unwittingly expose secrets to anyone who asks the right question, and the logs can easily leak this info to whoever has access. Worse yet, in this scenario, the LLM is telling your developers to use this plaintext credential. The security issues can stack up quickly.\nThe situation is not hopeless, though. In fact, if proper governance models are implemented around NHIs and secrets management, then developers can actually innovate and deploy faster.\nFive Actionable Controls to Reduce AI‑Related NHI Risk\nOrganizations looking to control the risks of AI-driven NHIs should focus on these five actionable practices:\nAudit and Clean Up Data Sources\nCentralize Your Existing NHIs Management\nPrevent Secrets Leaks In LLM Deployments\nImprove Logging Security\nRestrict AI Data Access\nLet's take a closer look at each one of these areas.\nAudit and Clean Up Data Sources\nThe first LLMs were bound only to the specific data sets they were trained on, making them novelties with limited capabilities.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nengineering changed this by allowing LLM to access additional data sources as needed. Unfortunately, if there are secrets present in these sources, the related identities are now at risk of being abused.\nData sources, including project management platform Jira, communication platforms like Slack, and knowledgebases such as Confluence, weren't built with AI or secrets in mind. If someone adds a plaintext API key, there are no safeguards to alert them that this is dangerous. A chatbot can easily become a secrets-leaking engine with the right prompting.\nThe only surefire way to prevent your LLM from leaking those internal secrets is to eliminate the secrets present or at least revoke any access they carry. An invalid credential carries no immediate risk from an attacker. Ideally, you can remove these instances of any secret altogether before your AI can ever retrieve it. Fortunately, there are tools and platforms, like GitGuardian, that can make this process as painless as possible.\nCentralize Your Existing NHIs Management\nThe quote \"If you can not measure it, you can not improve it\" is most often attributed to Lord Kelvin. This holds very true for non-human identity governance. Without taking stock of all the service accounts, bots, agents, and pipelines you currently have, there is little hope that you can apply effective rules and scopes around new NHIs associated with your agentic AI.\nThe one thing all those types of non-human identities have in common is that they all have a secret. No matter how you define NHI, we all define authentication mechanisms the same way: the secret. When we focus our inventories through this lens, we can collapse our focus to the proper storage and management of secrets, which is far from a new concern.\nThere are plenty of tools that can make this achievable, like HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk, or AWS Secrets Manager. Once they are all centrally managed and accounted for, then we can move from a world of long-lived credentials towards one where rotation is automated and enforced by policy.\nPrevent Secrets Leaks In LLM Deployments\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) servers are the new standard for how agentic AI is accessing services and data sources. Previously, if you wanted to configure an AI system to access a resource, you would need to wire it together yourself, figuring it out as you go. MCP introduced the protocol that AI can connect to the service provider with a standardized interface. This simplifies things and lessens the chance that a developer will hardcode a credential to get the integration working.\nIn one of the more alarming papers the GitGuardian security researchers have released, they found that\n5.2% of all MCP servers they could find contained at least one hardcoded secret\n. This is notably higher than the 4.6% occurrence rate of exposed secrets observed in all public repositories.\nJust like with any other technology you deploy, an ounce of safeguards early in the software development lifecycle can prevent a pound of incidents later on. Catching a hardcoded secret when it is still in a feature branch means it can never be merged and shipped to production. Adding secrets detection to the developer workflow via Git hooks or code editor extensions can mean the plaintext credentials never even make it to the shared repos.\nImprove Logging Security\nLLMs are black boxes that take requests and give probabilistic answers. While we can't tune the underlying vectorization, we can tell them if the output is as expected. AI engineers and machine learning teams log everything from the initial prompt, the retrieved context, and the generated response to tune the system in order to improve their AI agents.\nIf a secret is exposed in any one of those logged steps in the process, now you've got multiple copies of the same leaked secret, most likely in a third-party tool or platform. Most teams store logs in cloud buckets without tunable security controls.\nThe safest path is to add a sanitization step before the logs are stored or shipped to a third party. This does take some engineering effort to set up, but again, tools like GitGuardian's\nggshield\nare here to help with secrets scanning that can be invoked programmatically from any script. If the secret is scrubbed, the risk is greatly reduced.\nRestrict AI Data Access\nShould your LLM have access to your CRM? This is a tricky question and highly situational. If it is an internal sales tool locked down behind SSO that can quickly search notes to improve delivery, it might be OK. For a customer service chatbot on the front page of your website, the answer is a firm no.\nJust like we need to follow the principle of least privilege when setting permissions, we must apply a similar principle of least access for any AI we deploy. The temptation to just grant an AI agent full access to everything in the name of speeding things along is very great, as we don't want to box in our ability to innovate too early. Granting too little access defeats the purpose of RAG models. Granting too much access invites abuse and a security incident.\nRaise Developer Awareness\nWhile not on the list we started from, all of this guidance is useless unless you get it to the right people. The folks on the front line need guidance and guardrails to help them work more efficiently and safely. While we wish there were a magic tech solution to offer here, the truth is that building and deploying AI safely at scale still requires humans getting on the same page with the right processes and policies.\nIf you are on the development side of the world, we encourage you to share this article with your security team and get their take on how to securely build AI in your organization. If you are a security professional reading this, we invite you to share this with your developers and DevOps teams to further the conversation that AI is here, and we need to be safe as we build it and build with it.\nSecuring Machine Identity Equals Safer AI Deployments\nThe next phase of AI adoption will belong to organizations that treat non-human identities with the same rigor and care as they do human users. Continuous monitoring, lifecycle management, and robust secrets governance must become standard operating procedure. By building a secure foundation now, enterprises can confidently scale their AI initiatives and unlock the full promise of intelligent automation, without sacrificing security.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Threat hunters have exposed a novel campaign that makes use of search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning techniques to target employee mobile devices and facilitate payroll fraud.\nThe activity, first detected by ReliaQuest in May 2025 targeting an unnamed customer in the manufacturing sector, is characterized by the use of fake login pages to access the employee payroll portal and redirect paychecks into accounts under the threat actor's control.\n\"The attacker's infrastructure used compromised home office routers and mobile networks to mask their traffic, dodging detection and slipping past traditional security measures,\" the cybersecurity company\nsaid\nin an analysis published last week.\n\"The adversary specifically targeted employee mobile devices with a fake website impersonating the organization's login page. Armed with stolen credentials, the adversary gained access to the organization's payroll portal, changed direct deposit information, and redirected employees' paychecks into their own accounts.\"\nWhile the attacks have not been attributed to a specific hacking group, ReliaQuest said it's part of a broader, ongoing campaign owing to two similar incidents it investigated in late 2024.\nIt all starts when an employee searches for their company's payroll portal on search engines like Google, with deceptive lookalike websites surfacing to the top of the results using sponsored links. Those who end up clicking on the bogus links are led to a WordPress site that redirects to a phishing page mimicking a Microsoft login portal when visited from a mobile device.\nThe credentials entered on the fake landing page are subsequently exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled website, while also establishing a two-way WebSocket connection in order to alert the threat actor of stolen passwords using a push notifications API powered by\nPusher\n.\nThis gives attackers an opportunity to reuse the credentials as soon as possible before they are changed and gain unauthorized access to the payroll system.\nOn top of that, the targeting of employee mobile devices offers twofold advantages in that they lack enterprise-grade security measures typically available in desktop computers and they connect outside of the corporate network, effectively reducing visibility and hampering investigation efforts.\n\"By targeting unprotected mobile devices that lack security solutions and logging, this tactic not only evades detection but also disrupts efforts to analyze the phishing website,\" ReliaQuest said. \"This prevents security teams from scanning the site and adding it to indicators of compromise (IOC) threat feeds, further complicating mitigation efforts.\"\nIn a further attempt to sidestep detection, the malicious login attempts have been found to originate from residential IP addresses associated with home office routers, including those from brands like ASUS and Pakedge.\nThis indicates that the threat actors are exploiting weaknesses like security flaws, default credentials, or other misconfigurations often plaguing such network devices to launch brute-force attacks. Compromised routers are then infected with malware that enlists them into\nproxy botnets\n, which are eventually rented out to cybercriminals.\n\"When attackers use proxy networks, especially ones tied to residential or mobile IP addresses, they become much harder for organizations to detect and investigate,\" ReliaQuest said. \"Unlike VPNs, which are often flagged because their IP addresses have been abused before, residential or mobile IP addresses let attackers fly under the radar and avoid being classified as malicious.\"\n\"What's more, proxy networks allow attackers to make their traffic look like it originates from the same geographical location as the target organization, bypassing security measures designed to flag logins from unusual or suspicious locations.\"\nThe disclosure comes as Hunt.io\ndetailed\na phishing campaign that employs a fake Adobe Shared File service web page to steal Microsoft Outlook login credentials under the pretext of allowing access to files purportedly shared by a contact. The pages, per the company, are developed using the\nW3LL phishing kit\n.\nIt also coincides with the discovery of a new phishing kit codenamed CoGUI that's being used to actively target Japanese organizations by impersonating well-known consumer and finance brands such as Amazon, PayPay, MyJCB, Apple, Orico, and Rakuten. As many as 580 million emails have been sent between January and April 2025 as part of campaigns using the kit.\n\"CoGUI is a sophisticated kit that employs advanced evasion techniques, including geofencing, headers fencing, and fingerprinting to avoid detection from automated browsing systems and sandboxes,\" enterprise security firm Proofpoint\nsaid\nin an analysis released this month. \"The objective of the campaigns is to steal usernames, passwords, and payment data.\"\nThe phishing emails observed in the attacks include links that lead to credential phishing websites. That said, it's notable that CoGUI campaigns do not include capabilities to collect multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes.\nCoGUI is said to have been put to use since at least October 2024, and is believed to share some similarities with another well-known phishing toolkit codenamed\nDarcula\n– suggesting that the former could be part of the same\nChinese PhaaS ecosystem\ndubbed Smishing Triad that also includes Lucid and Lighthouse.\nThat said, one crucial aspect that separates Darcula from CoGUI is that the former is focused more on mobile and smishing, and aims to steal credit card details.\n\"Darcula is becoming more accessible, both in terms of cost and availability, so it could pose a significant threat in the future,\" PRODAFT told The Hacker News in a statement. \"On the other hand, Lucid continues to stay under the radar. It remains challenging to identify phishing kits just by looking at SMS messages or URL patterns, as they often use common delivery services.\"\nAnother new customizable smishing kit that has emerged out of the Chinese cybercrime landscape is Panda Shop, which uses a network of Telegram channels and interactive bots to automate service delivery. The phishing pages are designed to mimic popular brands and government services to steal personal information. Intercepted credit card data is sent to underground carding shops and sold to other cybercriminals.\n\"Notably, the Chinese cybercriminal syndicates involved in smishing are brazen because they feel untouchable,\" Resecurity\nsaid\n. \"They have emphasized in their communications that they do not care about U.S. law enforcement agencies. Residing in China, they enjoy complete freedom of action and engage in many illegal activities.\"\nResecurity, which identified Panda Shop in March 2025, said the threat actor operates a crime-as-a-service model similar to that of Smishing Triad, offering customers the ability to distribute smishing messages via Apple iMessage and Android RCS using compromised Apple and Gmail accounts purchased in bulk.\nIt's believed that Panda Shop includes Smishing Triad members based on the similarities in the phishing kits used. A plurality of threat actors have also been observed leveraging the smishing kit for Google Wallet and Apple Pay fraud.\n\"The actors behind smishing campaigns are tightly connected with those involved in merchant fraud and money laundering activity,\" Resecurity said. \"Smishing is one of the main catalysts behind carding activities, providing cybercriminals with substantial volumes of compromised data collected from victims.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Over the course of the phone conversation, the victim is emailed a link and guided to install a remote access program, giving the threat actors unauthorized access to their systems.\nArmed with the access, the attackers proceed to exfiltrate sensitive information and send an extortion note to the victim, demanding payment to avoid getting their stolen data published on a leaked site or sold to other cybercriminals.\nThe FBI said the Luna Moth actors have shifted their tactics as of March 2025 by calling individuals of interest and posing as employees from their company's IT department.\n\"SRG will then direct the employee to join a remote access session, either through an email sent to them, or navigating to a web page,\" the agency noted. \"Once the employee grants access to their device, they are told that work needs to be done overnight.\"\nThe threat actors, after obtaining access to the victim's device, have been found to escalate privileges and leverage legitimate tools like Rclone or WinSCP to facilitate data exfiltration.\nThe use of genuine system management or remote access tools such as Zoho Assist, Syncro, AnyDesk, Splashtop, or Atera to carry out the attacks means they are unlikely to be flagged by security tools installed on the systems.\n\"If the compromised device does not have administrative privileges, WinSCP portable is used to exfiltrate victim data,\" the FBI added. \"Although this tactic has only been observed recently, it has been highly effective and resulted in multiple compromises.\"\nDefenders are urged to be on the lookout for WinSCP or Rclone connections made to external IP addresses, emails or voicemails from an unnamed group claiming data was stolen, emails regarding subscription services providing a phone number and requiring a call to remove pending renewal charges, and unsolicited phone calls from individuals claiming to work in their IT departments.\nThe disclosure follows a report from EclecticIQ detailing Luna Moth's \"high-tempo\" callback phishing campaigns targeting U.S. legal and financial sectors using Reamaze Helpdesk and other remote desktop software.\nAccording to the Dutch cybersecurity company, at least 37 domains were registered by the threat actor via GoDaddy in March, most of which spoofed the targeted organizations' IT helpdesk and support portals.\n\"Luna Moth is primarily using helpdesk-themed domains, typically beginning with the name of the business being targeted, e.g., vorys-helpdesk[.]com,\" Silent Push\nsaid\nin a series of posts on X. \"The actors are using a relatively small range of registrars. The actors appear to use a limited range of nameserver providers, with domaincontrol[.]com being the most common.\"\nFound this article interesting?

It's believed to be active at least since 2021.\nAssessed to share overlaps with the Russian nation-state hacking crew APT28, activities associated with the threat actor were\nfirst documented\nby Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender in May 2023 in connection with a campaign that delivered a malware codenamed DownEx (aka STILLARCH) targeting government entities in Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nHowever, it was the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) that formally assigned the moniker UAC-0063 that same month after it\nuncovered\ncyber attacks targeting state bodies in the country using malware strains like LOGPIE, CHERRYSPY (aka DownExPyer), DownEx, and PyPlunderPlug.\nThe latest campaign aimed at Tajikistan organizations, observed starting January 2025, demonstrates a shift away from HATVIBE, distributed via HTA-embedded spear-phishing attachments, in favor of macro-enabled Word template (.DOTM) files, underscoring an evolution of their tactics.\n\"Previously, TAG-110 leveraged macro-enabled Word documents to deliver HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware, for initial access,\" Recorded Future said. \"The newly detected documents do not contain the embedded HTA HATVIBE payload for creating a scheduled task and instead leverage a global template file placed in the Word startup folder for persistence.\"\nThe phishing emails have been found to use Tajikistan government-themed documents as lure material, which aligns with its historical use of trojanized legitimate government documents as a malware delivery vector. However, the cybersecurity company said it could not independently verify the authenticity of these documents.\nPresent with the files is a VBA macro that's responsible for placing the document template in the Microsoft Word startup folder for automatic execution and subsequently initiating communications with a command-and-control (C2) server and potentially executing additional VBA code supplied with C2 responses. The exact nature of the second-stage payloads is not known.\n\"However, based on TAG-110's historical activity and tool set, it is likely that successful initial access via the macro-enabled templates would result in the deployment of additional malware, such as HATVIBE, CHERRYSPY, LOGPIE, or potentially a new, custom-developed payload designed for espionage operations,\" the company said.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Date": "2025-05-27",
        "Content": "More than 40,000 new vulnerabilities (CVEs) were published in 2024 alone. More than 60% of those were labeled “high” or “critical.” Sounds scary, sure, but how many of them actually put your environment at risk?\nNot nearly as many as you might think.\nScoring systems like CVSS flag severity based on technical factors. But they don’t know your network, your controls, or how you’ve hardened key assets. That’s a problem. Because without context, teams spend too much time chasing scary-looking bugs that may already be blocked, and miss the quiet ones that aren’t.\nThis post breaks down why traditional vulnerability prioritization often leads you astray, and how a better approach,\nexposure validation\n, helps teams focus on\nwhat’s truly exploitable.\nWhat’s the Problem With “Critical” Vulnerabilities?\nLet’s start with the numbers. Vulnerability disclosures jumped 38% last year. And many tools, scanners, patching platforms, and dashboards still sort them by raw CVSS or EPSS scores.\nBut here’s the thing: these are just global scores. This means that, because a vulnerability scores a 9.8 on paper, it doesn’t mean it has a critical impact on\nyour\nenvironment. Your firewall, EDR, IPS/IDS, or segmentation might already stop the exploit cold. Meanwhile, that “medium” severity issue buried lower on the list? It could actually be a ticking time bomb.\nThere’s also the speed of weaponization. In early 2024, more than half of exploited vulnerabilities were turned into working exploits shortly after public disclosure. Attackers move fast, often faster than defenders can react. And while new vulnerabilities grab headlines, many breaches still come down to older flaws we already know about but haven’t patched in time.\nWhat we have here isn’t a discovery problem, it’s a prioritization problem.\nWhy Traditional Scoring Falls Short\nLet’s break down how the usual systems work.\n(The) CVSS\ngives you a severity rating based on access requirements, privileges, and potential impact.\nEPSS\npredicts the likelihood of exploitation using external threat signals.\nCISA KEV\nflags known exploited vulnerabilities.\nHelpful? Sure, in big-picture terms, yes. But as helpful as they are, in theory, these systems don’t know\nyour specific\nenvironment.\nThey can’t tell if your IPS blocks the exploit, if the asset is isolated, or if the system even matters. So they treat all networks the same, which can easily lead to wasting time and resources on the wrong fixes due to a sense of\nfalse urgency\n.\nPrioritize Vulnerabilities That Truly Matter With Picus Exposure Validation\nReplace guesswork with proof.\nSee how Picus validates your risks against real attacks and focuses your efforts on exposures you actually need to fix.\nRequest Your Demo\nWhat Is Exposure Validation?\nExposure Validation flips the process. Instead of guessing how bad a vulnerability might be, it\ntests\nwhether it’s actually exploitable in your actual environment.\nIt’s like running safe, controlled attack simulations, using real-world adversarial techniques, to see if the entire kill chain of the exploitation campaign works on you. If your controls stop it, great. If not, now you know what to fix.\nThe goal is simple: replace assumptions with proof. This way, you can fix the vulnerabilities that matter the most, first.\nThe Tech Behind It: BAS + Automated Pentests\nExposure Validation relies on two types of safe, non-destructive tools.\nBreach and Attack Simulation (BAS)\n:\nBAS runs continuous attack scenarios using known tactics and malware behaviors documented in the wild. Think of them as a way to check whether your EDR, SIEM, and firewall are catching what they’re supposed to, against both known and emerging threats.\nAutomated Penetration Testing:\nThis technique mimics the actions of an attacker who already has access to your environment, testing how far they could go, once they’re inside. This includes lateral movement, privilege escalation, credential access, and attempts to reach sensitive targets like domain admins. It also frees up your red team to focus on more complex, creative, or critical attack paths.\nWorking together, these tools help your teams understand what attackers could\nreally\ndo in your network, not just what might be theoretically possible.\nWhen a CVSS Score of 9.4 Isn’t Critical\nLet’s see how this works in practice. Say a scanner flags a vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.4. That sounds serious. But exposure validation puts it to the test.\nFirst step: Is there a public exploit?\nYes. There’s a proof of concept available. But it’s not plug-and-play. It takes technical skill and some specific conditions to succeed. That makes this vulnerability less critical than it first appears, and the risk is adjusted to reflect that. This on its own drops the score to 8.7.\nNext: Can your defenses stop it?\nNow it’s time to check your security stack: cloud controls, network protections, endpoint tools, and SIEM rules. If those are already detecting or blocking the attack, the risk drops significantly.\nIn this case, your breach and attack simulation solution shows that your existing controls are doing their job, bringing the vuln’s score down to 6.0.\nLast check: Does the system matter?\nThe vulnerable asset is not critical. It does not hold sensitive data and does not impact core operations. With that in mind, the score drops again, this time to 2.4.\nIn this scenario, the scanner all but screamed it had a vulnerability with a 9.4 score and it was critical that you pay it some serious attention. However, in your real-world environment, this vuln would be blocked and detected, letting you deal with far more critical vulnerabilities to your org. This is what exposure validation does. It differentiates the real risks from the noise, letting you fix what matters and move on from what doesn’t.\nA Smarter Way to Prioritize\nPicus Security’s Exposure Validation (EXV) solution\nhelps teams move past surface-level scores and focus on what’s real.\nWe combine attack surface management, breach and attack simulation, and automated pentesting together to see whether a vulnerability can be exploited in your actual environment.\nThen it calculates a risk score that reflects real conditions, not just worst-case assumptions. That score takes into account three key factors:\nIs the vulnerability truly exploitable?\nAre your existing controls already blocking it?\nDoes the affected system actually matter to your organization and its daily operations?\nArmed with this context, your teams no longer have to chase down every high-severity alert. You get a clear, manageable list of exposures proven to matter to your business and its environment with far less noise.\nResults From the Field\nWhen teams stop relying on raw CVSS scores and start validating exposures, they start seeing results immediately.\nAs Picus, we’ve seen organizations cut their\ncritical vulnerability count by more than half, from 63 percent to just 10 percent\n. Same environment. Same tools. The only change was verifying what could actually be exploited.\nThat shift saves hours of patching, clears out the noise, and most importantly, lets security teams more effectively focus on real threats and effectively stop chasing ghosts.\nInstead of flooding workflows with hundreds of high-severity findings, teams get a clean, focused list of what truly matters. Less time spent arguing over priorities. More time fixing real issues.\nValidation turns vulnerability management into something actionable. You move faster, waste less, and protect what really matters.\nFinal Thoughts\nYou don’t need to fix everything. You just need to fix what’s real.\nExposure validation helps teams move past raw severity scores and start making decisions based on data.\nThe result? Better prioritization, stronger defenses, and a more secure organization.\nLearn more about\nPicus Security’s Exposure Validation (EXV) solution\n.\nSponsored and written by\nPicus Security\n."

The alleged breach could impact a vast number of United Airlines passengers, ranging from frequent flyers to occasional travelers, given the airline’s extensive global reach and customer base.\nThe origin of the alleged breach remains unclear, though the data appears to include sensitive information related to flight confirmations and passenger communications. Samples provided alongside the offering show details such as flight numbers, gate information, departure times, and confirmation numbers, along with direct URLs for Manage Reservations pages, which reportedly display user itinerary information and allow for ticket changes or cancellations. This also indicates a potentially severe exposure of sensitive customer control over their reservations.\nUnited Airlines has not yet publicly commented on these allegations.

These backups purportedly encompass a wide range of sensitive data from various systems, including audit, asset, vehicle, and project management databases.
