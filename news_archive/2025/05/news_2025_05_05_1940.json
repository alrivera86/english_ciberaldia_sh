        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a series of now-patched security vulnerabilities in Apple's AirPlay protocol that, if successfully exploited, could enable an attacker to take over susceptible devices supporting the proprietary wireless technology.\nThe shortcomings have been collectively codenamed\nAirBorne\nby Israeli cybersecurity company Oligo.\n\"These vulnerabilities can be chained by attackers to potentially take control of devices that support AirPlay – including both Apple devices and third-party devices that leverage the AirPlay SDK,\" security researchers Uri Katz, Avi Lumelsky, and Gal Elbaz\nsaid\n.\nSome of the vulnerabilities, like CVE-2025-24252 and CVE-2025-24132, can be strung together to fashion a wormable zero-click RCE exploit, enabling bad actors to deploy malware that propagates to devices on any local network the infected device connects to.\nThis could then pave the way for sophisticated attacks that can lead to the deployment of backdoors and ransomware, posing a serious security risk.\nThe vulnerabilities, in a nutshell, could enable zero- or one-click remote code execution (RCE), access control list (ACL) and user interaction bypass, local arbitrary file read, information disclosure, adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS).\nThis includes chaining CVE-2025-24252 and CVE-2025-24206 to achieve a zero-click RCE on macOS devices that are connected to the same network as an attacker. However, for this exploit to succeed, the AirPlay receiver needs to be on and set to the \"Anyone on the same network\" or \"Everyone\" configuration.\nIn a hypothetical attack scenario, a victim's device could get compromised when connected to a public Wi-Fi network. Should the device be connected later to an enterprise network, it could provide an attacker with a way to breach other devices that are connected to the same network.\nSome of the other notable flaws are listed below -\nCVE-2025-24271\n- An ACL vulnerability that can enable an attacker on the same network as a signed-in Mac to send AirPlay commands to it without pairing\nCVE-2025-24137\n- A vulnerability that could cause arbitrary code execution or an application to terminate\nCVE-2025-24132\n- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that could result in a zero-click RCE on speakers and receivers that leverage the AirPlay SDK\nCVE-2025-24206\n- An authentication vulnerability that could allow an attacker on the local network to bypass authentication policy\nCVE-2025-24270\n- A vulnerability that could allow an attacker on the local network to leak sensitive user information\nCVE-2025-24251\n- A vulnerability that could allow an attacker on the local network to cause an unexpected app termination\nCVE-2025-31197\n- A vulnerability that could allow an attacker on the local network to cause an unexpected app termination\nCVE-2025-30445\n- A type confusion vulnerability that could could allow an attacker on the local network to cause an unexpected app termination\nCVE-2025-31203\n- An integer overflow vulnerability that could allow an attacker on the local network to cause a DoS condition\nFollowing responsible disclosure, the identified vulnerabilities have been patched in the below versions -\niOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4\niPadOS 17.7.6\nmacOS Sequoia 15.4\nmacOS Sonoma 14.7.5\nmacOS Ventura 13.7.5\ntvOS 18.4, and\nvisionOS 2.4\nSome of the weaknesses (CVE-2025-24132 and CVE-2025-30422) have also been patched in AirPlay audio SDK 2.7.1, AirPlay video SDK 3.6.0.126, and CarPlay Communication Plug-in R18.1.\n\"For organizations, it is imperative that any corporate Apple devices and other machines that support AirPlay are updated immediately to the latest software versions,\" Oligo said.\n\"Security leaders also need to provide clear communication to their employees that all of their personal devices that support AirPlay need to also be updated immediately.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "What if attackers aren't breaking in—they're already inside, watching, and adapting?\nThis week showed a sharp rise in stealth tactics built for long-term access and silent control. AI is being used to shape opinions. Malware is hiding inside software we trust. And old threats are returning under new names. The real danger isn't just the breach—it's not knowing who's still lurking in your systems. If your defenses can't adapt quickly, you're already at risk.\nHere are the key cyber events you need to pay attention to this week.\n⚡ Threat of the Week\nLemon Sandstorm Targets Middle East Critical Infra\n— The Iranian state-sponsored threat group tracked as Lemon Sandstorm\ntargeted\nan unnamed critical national infrastructure (CNI) in the Middle East and maintained long-term access that lasted for nearly two years using custom backdoors like HanifNet, HXLibrary, and NeoExpressRAT. The activity, which lasted from at least May 2023 to February 2025, entailed \"extensive espionage operations and suspected network prepositioning – a tactic often used to maintain persistent access for future strategic advantage,\" according to Fortinet.\nHackers Exploit Active Directory Flaws - Lock Them Down Before They Do\nActive Directory misconfigurations give attackers the perfect entry point to escalate privileges and move laterally. One weak link is all it takes. Use this AD Security Checklist to identify and fix critical gaps before they're exploited, Download now and secure your Active Directory.\nDownload the Checklist ➝\n🔔 Top News\nClaude Abused in \"Influence-as-a-Service\" Operation\n— Artificial intelligence (AI) company Anthropic has\nrevealed\nthat unknown threat actors leveraged its Claude chatbot for an \"influence-as-a-service\" operation to engage with authentic accounts across Facebook and X using over 100 fake personas. What's novel about the operation is that it utilized Claude to make tactical engagement decisions such as determining whether social media bot accounts should like, share, comment on, or ignore specific posts created by other accounts based on political objectives aligned with their clients' interests. The bot accounts were used to amplify their clients' political narratives.\nSentinelOne Uncovers PurpleHaze Activity\n— Cybersecurity company SentinelOne has\ndisclosed\nthat a China-nexus threat cluster dubbed PurpleHaze conducted reconnaissance attempts against its infrastructure and some of its high-value customers. PurpleHaze is assessed to be a hacking crew with loose ties to another state-sponsored group known as APT15 and has also been observed targeting an unnamed South Asian government-supporting entity in October 2024, employing an operational relay box (ORB) network and a Windows backdoor called GoReShell.\nRansomHub Ransomware Operation Goes Dark\n— In an interesting twist, RansomHub, an aggressive ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that gained prominence over the past year by courting affiliates in the wake of law enforcement actions against LockBit and BlackCat, appears to have abruptly\ngone offline\nin early April. The sudden cessation has raised speculations that cybercriminals associated with the ransomware scheme may have migrated to Qilin, which has had a resurgence in recent months. It's also being claimed that RansomHub had moved its operations to DragonForce, a rival ransomware group that has announced the formation of a new \"cartel.\" Besides offering a multi-platform encryptor malware, RansomHub attracted attention for giving affiliates more autonomy to communicate directly with victims and to collect ransom payments from them. It also offered detailed guidance on how to extort ransom payments from victims.\nMeta Announces New Private Processing Feature for WhatsApp\n— In an attempt to balance privacy and artificial intelligence features, Meta announced a new WhatsApp setting it says is a privacy-oriented way to interact with Meta AI. Called Private Processing, the feature is optional and, launches in the coming weeks, and neither Meta, WhatsApp nor third-party companies will be able to see interactions that use it. The system Meta describes is very similar to Apple's Private Cloud Compute (PCC). Like Apple, Meta says it will relay Private Processing requests through a third-party OHTTP provider to obscure users' IP addresses. But one crucial difference is that all of WhatsApp's AI requests are handled on Meta's servers and its current architecture is purpose-built for WhatsApp. In a statement shared with WIRED, security researcher and cryptographer Matt Green\nsaid\n\"any end-to-end encrypted system that uses off-device AI inference is going to be riskier than a pure end-to-end system\" and that \"more private data will go off the device, and the machines that process this data will be a target for hackers and nation-state adversaries.\"\nTikTok Fined $601 Million By Ireland DPC\n— Ireland's data privacy watchdog\nfined\nTikTok about $601 million for failing to guarantee that user data sent to China was protected from government access under Chinese laws related to espionage and cybersecurity. It also sanctioned TikTok for not being transparent with users in its privacy policy about where their personal data was being sent. The Data Protection Commission (DPC) ordered the social video app to stop transferring user data to China within six months if it can't guarantee the same level of protection as in the E.U. The regulator also said TikTok previously claimed it did not store European user data on servers in China, but in April informed that it had discovered in February that \"limited EEA User Data\" had in fact been stored in China. The data is said to have been since deleted. The threat of Chinese government access to user data has been a persistent thorn in the side of TikTok on both sides of the Atlantic. While the platform was briefly banned in the U.S. at the start of the year, the service has continued to remain accessible as a deal is being worked out in the background. TikTok said it planned to appeal the E.U. fine, insisting it had \"never received a request\" from Chinese authorities for European users' data. It is the second time TikTok has been reprimanded by the DPC. It was fined $368 million in 2023 for breaching privacy laws regarding the processing of children's personal data in the E.U. This is the third-largest fine imposed by the DPC so far, after sanctioning Amazon with €746 million for its targeted behavioral advertising practices and Facebook with €1.2 billion for transferring data of E.U.-based users to the United States. The Irish watchdog serves as TikTok's lead data privacy regulator in the E.U. because the company's European headquarters is based in Dublin.\nTrending CVEs\nAttackers love software vulnerabilities—they're easy doors into your systems. Every week brings fresh flaws, and waiting too long to patch can turn a minor oversight into a major breach. Below are this week's critical vulnerabilities you need to know about. Take a look, update your software promptly, and keep attackers locked out.\nThis week's list includes —\nCVE-2025-3928\n(Commvault Web Server),\nCVE-2025-1976\n(Broadcom Brocade Fabric OS),\nCVE-2025-46271, CVE-2025-46272, CVE-2025-46273, CVE-2025-46274, CVE-2025-46275\n(\nPlanet Technology\n),\nCVE-2025-23016\n(FastCGI),\nCVE-2025-43864\n(React Router),\nCVE-2025-21756\n(Linux Kernel),\nCVE-2025-31650\n(Apache Tomcat),\nCVE-2025-46762\n(Apache Parquet),\nCVE-2025-2783\n(Google Chrome),\nCVE-2025-23242, CVE-2025-23243\n(NVIDIA Riva),\nCVE-2025-23254\n(NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM),\nCVE-2025-3500\n(Avast Free Antivirus),\nCVE-2025-32354\n(Zimbra Collaboration Server),\nCVE-2025-4095\n(Docker),\nCVE-2025-30194\n(PowerDNS),\nCVE-2025-32817\n(SonicWall Connect Tunnel Windows Client),\nCVE-2025-29953\n(Apache ActiveMQ),\nCVE-2025-4148\n,\nCVE-2025-4149\n,\nCVE-2025-4150\n(NETGEAR),\nCVE-2025-2082\n(Tesla Model 3),\nCVE-2025-3927\n(Digigram PYKO-OUT),\nCVE-2025-24522, CVE-2025-32011, CVE-2025-35996, CVE-2025-36558\n(KUNBUS Revolution Pi),\nCVE-2025-35975, CVE-2025-36521\n(MicroDicom DICOM Viewer),\nCVE-2025-2774\n(Webmin),\nCVE-2025-29471\n(Nagios), and\nCVE-2025-32434\n(PyTorch).\n📰 Around the Cyber World\nEuropol Announces New Task Force to Combat Violence-as-a-Service\n— Europol has\ncreated\na new operational task force (OTF) designed to tackle a growing problem of youngsters being groomed or coerced into being recruited by criminal service provider groups that specialize in online and physical attacks. Known as OTF GRIMM, the task force seeks to disrupt violence-as-a-service and brings together law enforcement authorities from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway. These schemes involve recruiting young people via social media platforms and messaging apps using coded language, memes, and gamified tasks, luring them with the promise of a luxurious lifestyle. The intention behind this deliberate act by criminal networks is to reduce their own risk and shield themselves from law enforcement. \"The exploitation of young perpetrators to carry out criminal acts has emerged as a fast-evolving tactic used by organized crime,\" the agency said. \"Violence-as-a-service refers to the outsourcing of violent acts to criminal service providers — often involving the use of young perpetrators to carry out threats, assaults, or killings for a fee.\"\nChina Accuses the U.S. of Launching Cyber Attack\n— U.S. intelligence agencies reportedly launched cyber attacks against a major Chinese commercial cryptography provider in 2024, stealing 6.2 GB of critical project data, according to a report from China's National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center (CNCERT/CC). The attack is said to have exploited an undisclosed vulnerability in the company's customer relationship management system to gain access, implanting a custom trojan for remote control and data theft. \"The compromised system contained over 600 user accounts, 8,000 customer profile records, and more than 10,000 contract orders, some involving key Chinese government entities,\" Global Times\nreported\n. Earlier this January, the agency\nsaid\nit had \"handled two incidents of cyber attacks [that] originated from the United States on China's large-scale tech firms to steal trade secrets.\" The activities targeted an advanced materials design and research institution in China in August 2024 and a large-scale high-tech firm in May 2023.\nBreachForums compromised in a zero-day attack on MyBB Software\n— BreachForums (breachforums[.]sx) has been resurrected after a previous version hosted on \"breachforums[.]st\" was taken offline through a MyBB zero-day exploit as part of a law enforcement action, the site's new administrator Momondo claimed. The specific details of the zero-day exploit have not been publicly disclosed. The cybercrime forum was\nfirst taken down\nin 2023 and its original administrator Conor Brian Fitzpatrick (aka Pompompurin) arrested for operating the site. Since then, the site has resurfaced time and again using a revolving door of administrators and site addresses.\nTwo Arrested in Connection With JokerOTP Operation\n— Two individuals, a 24-year-old man from Middlesbrough and a 30-year-old from the Oost-Brabant region of The Netherlands, have been\narrested\nin a joint international operation dismantling JokerOTP, a sophisticated phishing tool used to intercept two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and steal over £7.5 million. \"Over a two-year period, the tool is believed to have been used across 13 countries and over 28,000 times. It is suspected that financial accounts have been compromised, totaling £7.5 million,\" Cleveland Police's Cyber Crime Unit\nsaid\n.\nMicrosoft Details CVE-2025-31191 macOS Flaw\n— Microsoft has shared details on\nCVE-2025-31191\n, a macOS vulnerability in Apple's CoreServices component that could allow a malicious app to access sensitive user data. Apple addressed the issue in late March 2025 with macOS Sequoia 15.4. According to Microsoft researcher Jonathan Bar Or, the flaw\ncould\n\"allow specially crafted codes to escape the App Sandbox and run unrestricted on the system.\" In other words, an attacker could create an exploit to escape the macOS sandbox without user interaction and perform further malicious actions like elevating privileges, exfiltrating data, and deploying additional payloads. The company also detailed an attack scenario wherein the exploit \"could allow an attacker to delete and replace a keychain entry used to sign\nsecurity-scoped bookmarks\nto ultimately escape the App Sandbox without user interaction.\" Security-scoped bookmarks are a mechanism designed by Apple to specifically get around the App Sandbox rules using explicit, persistent user choices.\nNew Supply Chain Attack Targets Magento Sites\n— In what has been described as a \"coordinated supply chain attack,\" hundreds of e-commerce stores running Magento have been backdoored since late April 2025. Sansec said it identified 21 application packages from vendors Tigren, Meetanshi, and MGS with the same backdoor. It has been found that the infrastructure associated with these vendors had been breached to inject backdoors into their download servers. \"The backdoor consists of a fake license check in a file called License.php or LicenseApi.php,\" Sansec\nsaid\n. \"The evil is in the adminLoadLicense function, which executes $licenseFile as PHP.\" Specifically, it includes code to upload arbitrary payloads like web shells, which could then be used to perform various malicious actions. The backdoor injections occurred six years ago, but it wasn't until April 2025 that they were activated to take control of the servers.\nU.S. House Passes Bill to Study Router Risks\n— A bill requiring the U.S. Department of Commerce to study national security issues posed by routers and modems controlled by U.S. adversaries\npassed\nthe House of Representatives. Called the Removing Our Unsecure Technologies to Ensure Reliability and Security (\nROUTERS\n) Act, it aims to safeguard Americans' communications networks from foreign-adversary controlled technology such as routers and modems. The proposed legislation mandates the Department of Commerce to assess the risks posed by routers, modems, and other devices developed, manufactured, or supplied by its adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, or Venezuela.\nNew OpenEoX Framework Published to Coordinate Product End-of-Life Security Disclosures\n— Tech giants Cisco, Dell Technologies, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat, and others have teamed up for a new\nOpenEoX\nframework that hopes to standardize end-of-life (EoL) and end-of-support (EoS) information to better protect the supply chain and combat cybersecurity risks linked to unsupported software and hardware. \"OpenEoX introduces a much-needed, unified framework designed to streamline the exchange of end-of-life (EoL) and end-of-security-support (EoSSec) data that enables transparency and efficiency,\"\nsaid\nOmar Santos, OpenEoX co-chair and Cisco Distinguished Engineer.\nHackers Scan for Leaked Git Tokens and Secrets\n— Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise\nsaid\nit has observed a significant increase in crawling activity targeting\nGit configuration files\nbetween April 20 and 21, 2025, likely in an attempt to access internal codebases, developer workflows, and potentially sensitive credentials. Nearly 4,800 unique IP addresses have participated in the effort that mainly targeted Singapore, the U.S., Germany, the United Kingdom, and India. There have been four such spikes since September 2024, the other three instances recorded in November 2024, December 2024, and early March 2024. The development comes as GreyNoise also said it has witnessed a \"sharp and sustained decline\" in\nopportunistic scanning\nof Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS GlobalProtect portals. \"The majority of IPs involved in this activity are associated with the provider, 3xK Tech GmbH – accounting for nearly 20,000 of the 25,000+ IPs observed in the past 90 days,\" it\nsaid\n.\nGarantex Likely Rebrands as Grinex\n— The now-sanctioned cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, which had its website\nseized\nin March 2025 by law enforcement, has likely rebranded as Grinex, TRM Labs revealed. \"Days after Garantex's takedown, Telegram channels affiliated with the exchange began promoting Grinex, a platform with a nearly identical interface, registered in Kyrgyzstan in December 2024,\" the company\nsaid\n. Grinex has since announced it had entered into an agreement with Garantex to onboard its clients and was considering hiring former Garantex employees. It has also begun to distribute former Garantex user assets through a new token, A7A5. \"From as early as January 2025, Garantex began moving funds into A7A5, a purported stablecoin pegged to the Russian ruble. Promoted as a means to recover frozen user assets, A7A5 appears engineered to evade sanctions, offering daily profit-sharing and anonymity through platforms like TRON and Ethereum,\" TRM Labs said.\nFlaws Disclosed in Jan AI\n— Multiple security flaws (CVE-2025-2439, CVE-2025-2445, CVE-2025-2446, and CVE-2025-2447) have been disclosed in Menlo Research's\nJan AI\n, an offline ChatGPT alternative, that could be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to manipulate systems, \"With vulnerabilities ranging from missing CSRF protection of state-changing endpoints to command injection, an attacker can leverage these to take control of a self-hosted server or issue drive-by attacks against LLM developers,\" Snyk\nsaid\n. The issues have since been addressed.\nNew macOS Malware Families Detailed\n— Kandji researchers have flagged a new suspicious macOS program called\nPasivRobber\nthat's capable of gathering data from various apps like WeChat, QQ, web browsers, and email clients, among others through 28 different plugins. The tool is believed to be linked to a Chinese company called Meiya Pico, which develops forensic tools and was previously\nidentified\nby the U.S. Treasury Department as one of the eight firms that \"support the biometric surveillance and tracking of ethnic and religious minorities in China, particularly the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang.\" The disclosure coincided with the discovery of another malware called ReaderUpdate that acts as a loader to serve the Genieo (aka DOLITTLE) adware, with variants of the malware written in Python, Crystal, Nim, Rust, and Go. The malware, first detected in 2020, has been distributed via free and third-party software download sites, in the form of package installers containing fake or trojanized utility applications. \"Where compromised, hosts remain vulnerable to the delivery of any payload the operators choose to deliver, whether of their own or sold as Pay-Per-Install or Malware-as-a-Service on underground markets,\" SentinelOne\nsaid\n.\nApple Sends Out Notifications for Spyware Attacks\n— Apple has sent out threat notifications advising users in 100 countries that their phones may have been targeted by advanced commercial spyware. This included an\nItalian journalist\nand a Dutch activist, according to\nTechCrunch\n. It's not yet clear what spyware campaign, if known, the Apple notifications relate to. Apple has been sending out such notices to those targeted in state-sponsored attacks since 2021. The news comes as the\nMeta-NSO Group case\nhas\nmoved\nto the next phase, with Meta asking the spyware company to pay over $440,000 in compensatory damages. NSO Group, in response, has accused Meta of inflating its damages and letting the malware remain on WhatsApp servers to \"steal NSO's trade secrets.\"\nFrance Accuses Russia of Years of Cyber Attacks\n— France's foreign ministry has\naccused\nRussia's GRU military intelligence agency of\nmounting\ncyber attacks on a dozen entities including ministries, defense firms, research entities, and think tanks since 2021 in an attempt to destabilize the nation. The attacks have been\nlinked\nto a hacking group called\nAPT28\n(aka BlueDelta or Fancy Bear). The ministry said APT28's attacks on France go as far back as 2015, when French television channel TV5Monde was targeted, and that the formidable military intelligence hackers have sought to obtain strategic intelligence from entities across Europe and North America. The intrusions are said to have relied on phishing, vulnerability exploitation (e.g.,\nCVE-2023-23397\n), poorly-secured edge devices, and brute-force attacks against webmail as initial access vectors, while also repeatedly targeting Roundcube email servers to exfiltrate inbox data and using phishing emails to distribute malware families like\nHeadLace and OCEANMAP\n, while attempting to evade detection by hiding behind low-cost and ready-to-use outsourced infrastructure. The development comes as Russia-aligned hacktivists like\nNoName057(16)\nhave taken responsibility for\nlarge-scale DDoS attacks\ntargeting Dutch organizations as a payback for sending €6 billion in military aid to Ukraine.\nCloudflare Blocks 20.5M DDoS attacks in Q1 2025\n— Speaking of DDoS attacks, Cloudflare said it blocked 20.5 million of them in the first quarter of 2025, a 358% year-over-year (YoY) increase and a 198% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). In comparison, it blocked 21.3 million DDoS attacks during the calendar year 2024. \"Of the 20.5 million DDoS attacks blocked in Q1, 16.8 million were network-layer DDoS attacks, and of those, 6.6M targeted Cloudflare's network infrastructure directly,\" it\nnoted\n. \"Another 6.9 million targeted hosting providers and service providers protected by Cloudflare.\" These attacks were part of an 18-day multi-vector DDoS campaign comprising SYN flood attacks, Mirai-generated DDoS attacks, and SSDP amplification attacks. The web infrastructure company said it also blocked approximately 700 hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks that exceeded 1 Tbps or 1 Bpps. In late April 2025, the company revealed it\nmitigated\na record-breaking DDoS attack peaking at 5.8 Tbps, which lasted for approximately 45 seconds. The previous record was a\n5.6 Tbps DDoS attack\nthat leveraged a Mirai-based botnet comprising 13,000 devices.\nBabuk2 Bjorka Represents Data Commoditization at Scale\n— Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a cybercrime operation called Babuk2 Bjorka that ostensibly masquerades as an evolution of the Babuk RaaS operation, but, in reality, is an \"industrial scale data commoditization enterprise\" that works by selling recycled stolen data from other ransomware groups on cybercrime forums. \"The group is not just copying and pasting old leaks; they're building a brand, establishing a market presence, and creating a sustainable operational model,\" Trustwave SpiderLabs\nsaid\n.\nFBI Shares List of 42,000 LabHost Phishing Domains\n— The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released a massive list of 42,000 phishing domains tied to the LabHost cybercrime platform, which was\ndismantled\nin April 2024. These domains, obtained from the backend servers, were registered between November 2021 and April 2024. \"Though the LabHost domains are historical in nature, this list of over 42,000 domains may provide insight for network defenders and cyber threat intelligence personnel on adversary tactics and techniques,\" the FBI\nsaid\n.\nPolish Police Disrupts Cybercrime Gang\n— Polish authorities have\ndismantled\nan international cybercrime group accused of defrauding dozens of victims out of nearly $665,000. Nine people aged between 19 to 51 have been arrested in connection with the case. The suspects are believed to have posed as bank employees and law enforcement officers to trick victims into transferring funds to accounts under their control. At least 55 people were targeted as part of the scam since April 2023.\nCritical Security Flaws in Browser Wallets\n— Security vulnerabilities have been identified in browser wallets such as Stellar Freighter, Frontier Wallet, and Coin98 that could permit attackers to drain funds without requiring any social engineering or phishing attempts. \"Simply visiting the wrong site could silently expose your recovery phrase, allowing attackers to drain your funds whenever they want,\" Coinspect\nsaid\n. \"A malicious site could steal the secret recovery phrase even when the wallet was locked and without requiring any user approval to connect.\" There is no evidence that the shortcomings were exploited in the wild.\nNew Reverse NFCGate Technique Revealed\n— The legitimate\nNFCGate\napplication, which is used to capture, analyze, or modify near-field communication (NFC) traffic from Android devices, has been misused to steal 40 million rubles from Russian bank customers as of January 2025, cybersecurity firm F6 has\nrevealed\n. Fraudsters have been observed modifying the application, masking it as government and banking services to carry out their activities. Last month, it\nnoted\nthat the total amount of damage from attacks on customers of Russian banks using NFCGate-based malware for the first two months of 2025 is estimated at almost 200 million rubles. In March 2025, there were an estimated 180 thousand compromised devices in Russia, on which NFCGate and another malware called\nCraxsRAT\nwere installed. But in what appears to be a further escalation of the threat actor's tactics, a new attack scheme known as reverse NFCGate has come to light. The attacks seek to trick victims into downloading a malicious app to secure their accounts. Once installed and opened, the victims are notified via a pop-up window that they need to set the malware as the default application for contactless payments. The attack then directs them to the ATM to deposit money into their own accounts under various pretexts. \"In the reverse version of NFCGate, the application uses the ability to relay NFC traffic to transmit the drop card data to the user's device,\" F6\nsaid\n. \"When, as a result of the fraudulent attack, the victim comes to the ATM to deposit money into their account, they will place their smartphone on the ATM's NFC module, but instead of their card, they will log in with the drop card, to whom the entire amount will be sent.\" As many as 175,000 compromised devices have been detected in the country as of March 2025, with over 1,000 confirmed attacks conducted on clients of leading Russian banks using the reverse version of NFCGate. The average amount of damage from attacks using the reverse version of NFCGate is 100 thousand rubles.\n🎥 Cybersecurity Webinars\n🤖\nDiscover the Smartest Way to Secure AI Agents—Before They're Exploited\n: AI agents are powerful—but risky. They can leak data, be tricked, or expose systems if not secured right. Join Michelle Agroskin (Auth0) to learn how to build AI agents that are smart and safe. Real risks, clear fixes, no fluff.\n☁️\nRedesign Security on Your Terms—From Code to Cloud to SOC\n: Code scans alone won't save you. Today's attacks move faster than your teams can react — especially when AppSec, cloud, and SOC operate in silos. Join Ory Segal (Palo Alto Networks) to learn how connecting code, cloud, and security ops can slash response times and stop threats before they spread.\n🛡️\nLearn to Build a Compliant Cyber Defense Program That Actually Works\n: Reasonable cybersecurity isn't optional—it's expected. Laws, regulators, and courts now demand proof that your defenses are practical, prioritized, and well-documented. Join CIS® experts to learn how to build a defensible program using the CIS Controls, CSAT Pro, and SecureSuite® tools — so you can protect smarter, show compliance faster, and cut through complexity.\n🔧 Cybersecurity Tools\nMCPSafetyScanner\n— This open-source tool audits your MCP server config for critical security flaws — like exposed SSH keys, leaked API credentials, or unsafe path access. It uses multi-agent analysis to generate actionable safety reports so developers can patch risks before attackers find them.\nHANAlyzer\n— It is a new open-source tool that automates SAP's complex security checklist—no manual auditing, no guesswork. Built by Anvil Secure, it runs locally, produces clean HTML reports, and checks 30+ controls across users, networks, encryption, and more. One command. Instant insight. If you're managing HANA environments, this is a no-brainer.\nKnow Your Enemies\n— It is another powerful open-source tool that scans IAM roles and S3 bucket policies to uncover third-party access — including unknown vendors and misconfigured trust relationships. It detects confused deputy risks, matches account IDs to known vendors, and generates clear markdown reports your security team can act on immediately. Run it in minutes. Know exactly who's inside your cloud.\n🔒 Tip of the Week\nSandbox Your AI Agent — File Access Is the Silent Threat\n— Most AI agents don't need access to your system files — but they often have it by default. That means if an attacker tricks your agent (via prompt injection, plugin abuse, or tool misuse), it could accidentally expose things like SSH keys, cloud credentials, or logs. This is one of the easiest ways for attackers to move deeper into your environment — and it often goes unnoticed.\nEven if you've locked down API access or IAM roles, the local file system is still a weak spot. Your agent might be able to read .ssh/authorized_keys, .aws/credentials, or even environment files with secrets — just by asking the right question. And once that data is exposed, it's game over.\nYou can fix this fast with sandboxing. Use tools like Firejail (Linux) to block access to sensitive folders. This blocks the agent from seeing key files, locks down temp folders, and adds guardrails — even if something inside the agent misbehaves.\nRunning your AI agent in a sandbox takes minutes, but massively reduces your attack surface. It's a small move that closes a big gap — and it works even if everything else looks secure.\nConclusion\nEvery alert this week reinforces a simple truth: cybersecurity isn't just about defense—it's about detection, speed, and accountability. As threats grow quieter and more calculated, the margin for delay shrinks. Don't just monitor. Measure. Map. Respond. Then ask yourself—where else could they be?\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Let's be honest: if you're one of the first (or\nthe\nfirst) security hires at a small or midsize business, chances are you're also the unofficial CISO, SOC, IT Help Desk, and whatever additional roles need filling. You're not running a security department. You are THE security department. You're getting pinged about RFPs in one area, and reviewing phishing alerts in another, all while sifting through endless FP alerts across the board. The tools meant to help are often creating more work than they solve. Security teams end up choosing between letting things slip or becoming the \"Department of No.\"\nChances are you inherited your company's Google Workspace. Thankfully, Google handles the infrastructure, the uptime, and the spam filtering. But while Google takes care of a lot, it doesn't cover everything, and it can be difficult for security teams to operationalize all of Google's underlying capabilities without significant engineering work. It's your job to secure the perimeter, even when the perimeter is practically everywhere.\nEven with limited time and personnel, you can leverage Google's excellent security foundations to get the most out of the tools at your disposal. So where do you start?\nIdentity is Your First Line of Defense\nThe concept of a traditional security perimeter has faded in the era of cloud-native work. Firewalls and physical network boundaries no longer define the edges of your environment. We've been calling identity the \"new\" perimeter for over a decade: it determines who has access, from where, and under what circumstances. This makes identity protection the most critical layer in your security strategy. When identity controls are weak or misconfigured, an attacker does not need to break into your systems. They simply log in. Every action beyond that point is implicitly trusted.\nWhat to do:\nEnforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n— MFA is table stakes at this point, but it's worth reinforcing: a strong authentication strategy begins with requiring multi-factor authentication for all users, without exception. This includes executives, administrators, contractors, and part-time staff. MFA adds an essential layer of security that protects against the most common attack vector: stolen credentials.\nConfiguration should be enforced through either Google Workspace directly or a third-party identity provider (IdP) that supports conditional access and stronger policy enforcement. Regular reviews of MFA enrollment status across user groups should also be conducted–including GWS Super Admins to ensure they're not bypassing IdP and MFA.\nUse Context-Aware Access\n— Google's context-aware access policies should be implemented to evaluate the trustworthiness of each access request in real-time. These policies allow restrictions based on device type, geographic location, IP address, and user role. For example, access to administrative functions or sensitive documents can be limited to managed devices within trusted regions. Context-aware access enhances the granularity of access control beyond a simple username and password, reducing the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials.\nMinimize Admin Access\n—\nA robust access control model should follow the principle of least privilege. Administrator privileges should be carefully scoped and assigned only when absolutely necessary. It is important to regularly audit administrative roles and permissions to ensure they align with current responsibilities (there comes a time in every startup's maturity curve where you have to decide whether the founders still need Super Admin access). Temporary elevation of privileges should be preferred over permanent admin access. Audit logs can provide visibility into how and when administrative roles are used, helping to identify misuse or overprovisioning.\nWhy it matters:\nMost attacks begin with stolen credentials. If identity is weak, everything else falls apart like a Jenga tower. MFA and device-aware access are your way of adding glue between the pieces.\nEmail Is a Great Asset… and Liability\nEmail is the nervous system of your organization, but it's also the front door for attackers. Phishing, social engineering, invoice fraud, and business email compromise remain at the top of threat reports for a reason. It all starts through Gmail.\nWhat to do:\nEnable Enhanced Gmail Protections\n—\nGoogle's advanced phishing and malware protections should be enabled to reduce exposure to common email-based attacks. These features are located within the Admin console under Gmail > Safety, though they may not be activated by default. Default configurations often require additional review to ensure that all protections are fully utilized. Regular audits of these settings can help confirm that security baselines are consistently applied across the organization.\nConfigure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC\n—\nThe implementation of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols is essential for preventing domain spoofing and impersonation attacks. These technologies act as authentication checkpoints for incoming and outgoing emails, validating that messages are truly coming from legitimate sources. Google Workspace includes built-in tools for configuration, but careful setup and ongoing monitoring are necessary to ensure proper alignment with your domain settings. Periodic testing of these configurations can identify gaps or misalignments that undermine their effectiveness.\nForwarding Rule Alerting\n—\nForwarding rules within Gmail should be closely monitored, as they are a common mechanism for attackers to exfiltrate sensitive information. A compromised account may be quietly configured to forward emails to an external address, often without user awareness. Google Workspace audit logs can reveal the creation or modification of such rules, and custom alerts can be configured in the Alert Center to notify administrators of suspicious forwarding behavior. Regular reviews of both active and historic forwarding rules should be included as part of your security operations cadence.\nWhy it matters:\nAs long as the human factor is involved in some shape or form, phishing will always be a possibility. One click from a distracted employee and you're dealing with a compromised mailbox. Google catches a lot of junk, but not all of it. And once an attacker is inside, Google's controls don't do much to stop the bleeding.\nData Loss is a Slow and Often Silent Threat\nIn a world where information flows freely across chats, shared drives, and email threads, maintaining control over sensitive data is both crucial and increasingly difficult. Data loss is rarely the result of a single catastrophic event. Instead, it occurs gradually through well-meaning employee mistakes, unchecked sharing permissions, or subtle, malicious actions that evade basic detection. These minor leaks compound over time and can have a devastating cumulative effect on your organization's security posture and compliance obligations.\nWhat to do:\nUse Labels to Classify and Control Sensitive Data\n—\nLabels in Google Workspace act as metadata tags that can be applied to documents, emails, and other assets to indicate their sensitivity or business function (e.g., \"Confidential,\" \"Finance Only,\" or \"Customer Data\"). These labels are not just for organization, they can trigger automated security policies, such as restricting external sharing, disabling downloads, or enforcing encryption. Applying labels consistently allows you to scale DLP efforts without relying solely on manual enforcement. It also helps you identify and prioritize which content requires the most protection, making ongoing data hygiene efforts more focused and effective.\nRestrict External Sharing\n—\nDomain-level sharing settings should be carefully configured to prevent files from being shared with 'Anyone with the link,' since this often results in unintended public exposure. A whitelist of approved external domains should be established and enforced to define which recipients are authorized for external sharing. Users should be advised to share documents only with individuals who have a specific business need. Google Drive audit logs should be reviewed routinely to detect patterns of excessive or risky sharing behaviors. Labels or sensitivity tags should be applied to documents to clearly indicate the appropriate level of confidentiality.\nUse Default Google DLP Rules\n—\nBegin by enabling Data Loss Prevention policies that are pre-configured to detect common sensitive data types such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other forms of personally identifiable information (PII). While ongoing maintenance of DLP policies is time-consuming and tends to remain on the permanent backburner of to-do lists, you can maximize protection with minimal effort by focusing on your crown jewels–label the confidential and high-value company IP (like source code). Ensure those are protected at a minimum, and expand your policy as time allows to ensure that DLP is actively monitoring data across Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Chat to provide broad coverage against unintentional or malicious data exposure.\nWhy it matters:\nDLP and sharing controls are your seatbelts. You hope you never need them, but when you do, they'd better work. Accidental data leaks are just as damaging as intentional breaches, but with the right controls in place, their risk can be minimized.\nEstablish Visibility as Broadly as Possible\n\"You can't protect what you can't see\" is a well-worn cliche, but that doesn't make it any less true. You don't need to implement a full-blown Security Operations Center (SOC) in order to be effective. But maintaining constant visibility across your environment is fundamental.\nWhat to do:\nUse Google's Alert Center\n—\nAlthough it does not catch every issue, Google's Alert Center provides visibility into high-risk events such as suspicious logins or malware-infected emails.\nReview Audit Logs Regularly\n—\nIt is essential to establish a consistent and recurring schedule for reviewing audit logs to ensure timely detection of security anomalies and unauthorized activities across your Google Workspace environment. During these reviews, look for anomalies: file sharing spikes, strange login patterns, or changes in admin roles.\nIntegrate with a SIEM if Possible\n—\nEven if you are only able to use lightweight tools such as Google's Chronicle or a basic SIEM instance, centralizing your logs can help you identify patterns over time.\nWhy it matters:\nYou don't have the capacity to investigate every individual alert. However, if you are not monitoring your logs, then no one is. The difficulty for many teams is that with the breadth and volume of jobs to be done by small security teams, making the time to regularly review logs in a timely fashion and keep tabs on all potential alerts is difficult, if not impossible. The key is to automate what you can, and to consistently make time to review the rest.\nWhere Google Leaves Off and Where Cloud Workspace Security Begins\nNo collaboration suite was designed to operate in lockdown. Email wasn't designed to be a zero-trust environment, and Workspace is no different. It's fantastic at keeping the basic bad guys out but once they're in, their behavior can be difficult to distinguish from normal use.\nImagine a burglar breaks into your house and not by smashing a window, but by using a key they fished out of your mailbox. Once inside, your defenses assume the person walking around is allowed to be there. The lights are on, the alarm is silent and the burglar has the run of the place.\nCloud workspace security tools like Material Security exist for this exact scenario. It assumes compromise is inevitable and works ahead of time to contain it.\nGetting Off on the Right Foot: Clean Up Existing Settings and Permissions\nUnless you stood GWS up, you inherited it: the settings, the sharing behavior, and the sensitive data within. As time goes on, these things don't disappear or resolve themselves: they only get more complicated. Understanding the state of the infrastructure is key to effectively managing it.\nSensitive Data in Email\nIf an account was compromised, what data would it have access to that would be valuable? Mailboxes contain years of sensitive emails. Each organization has to determine how to manage this according to its risk tolerance: weighing the convenience of keeping emails in inboxes against the security of removing confidential, regulated, and proprietary information.\nWith Material, sensitive historical data in email is secured behind an MFA prompt–keeping attackers out without hampering users.\nSensitive Data in Files\nDrive contains sensitive files created by or shared with an account. Again, weighing collaboration against security: restrictive sharing policies will minimize the surface risk but slow your team down–and can open up new vulnerabilities if employees work around overly-restrictive sharing rules.\nMaterial's Explorer makes it easy to find sensitive content wherever it lives across your Gmail and Drive footprint.\nSettings\nLoopholes in message moderation can poke holes in your defenses–things like default group moderation settings that allow potentially-malicious messages to get to your executives and VIPs. It's also important to look for gaps in your MFA program (IMAP/POP access, application-specific passwords, and more).\nDetect and remediate a broad range of misconfigurations, risky behaviors, and other vulnerabilities.\nShadow IT\nEmployees using unsanctioned apps and services is a persistent problem, as teams try out new unapproved tools. Self-serve password resets, one-time passwords, and other account verifications circumvent intended identity protection protocols. Getting a handle on what's in use within your environment and by whom is critical to understanding your risk.\nStaying on the Right Path: Preventing Configuration Drift\nMaintain Visibility and Control Through Automated Continuous Monitoring\nYour Google Workspace environment is constantly evolving alongside its threats. Material provides continuous configuration monitoring that doesn't just scan your settings once and call it a day. Instead, it keeps a persistent watch on your configuration posture, alerting you immediately when something drifts from baseline or veers into risky territory. It's like having a vigilant co-pilot who never gets tired, constantly ensuring your environment is in line with security best practices. Whether it's a new app being granted broad scopes or a permissions setting quietly altered, Material keeps you informed and in control. This significantly reduces the time teams spend on tedious manual reviews and frees them up to focus on higher-order security concerns while ensuring missteps don't go unnoticed or unaddressed.\nMonitor all risks and threats across all of Google Workspace in a single dashboard\nStrike the Right Balance Between Productivity and Security\nSmall security teams don't have to be the department of \"no,\" but they need to know what's happening in their environment. Google Drive facilitates rapid, effective collaboration, but over time, the sprawl of sensitive content shared outside the organization or even publicly becomes unmanageable no matter how big the team is. Material manages sharing behavior at scale, notifying files owners of risky sharing behavior and allowing windows to self-heal or justify the sharing, and allowing security teams to set auto-remediation timeframes to fit their organization's risk tolerance.\nAlert users of improper sharing behavior and automatically remediate with granular settings tailored to your risk tolerance.\nAutomate what should be automated, simplify what can't\nToo many detection and response tools on the market are all too light on the \"response.\" Material has a broad range of \"close to the source\" actions that can be set up to run automatically: rewriting links in detected phishing emails, applying labels to files that are detected with sensitive information, revoking user sessions when suspicious activity is detected, and more. But not every problem can be solved without human expertise; for those complex issues that require a human decision or nuanced fix, Material provides a range of one-click remediations as well as links to the Workspace settings page to remediate the issue.\nFix Misconfigurations Automatically\nMisconfigurations are the silent killers of cloud workspace security. They often stem from well-meaning admin actions or overlooked toggles in a complex UI. With automated fix implementation for a wide range of common security missteps, Material removes the need for endless back-and-forth between alerts and actions. By resolving issues before they can be exploited, Material helps teams close security gaps early, leading to a leaner, more resilient posture with fewer vulnerabilities introduced through human error.\nSecuring Google Workspace Is Just the Start\nAs a one-person security team, you don't need perfection but you do need leverage. Google gives you a strong baseline, but it was built for scalability, not scrutiny. You need tools that fill the gaps, centralize all your cloud workspace detection and response, and work to keep employees productivity AND secure.\nMaterial Security gives you that second layer of defense. In a world where threats and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect, having something that helps you operate like a fully staffed security team can make a world of difference.\nSo yes, turn on the Gmail filters. Lock down file sharing. Check your audit logs. But don't stop there. Assume breach. Plan for it. And partner with a platform that helps you respond when it happens.\nCurious how this could work in your org?\nCheck out Material Security\nto see how a purpose-built cloud workspace security solution can simplify and strengthen your security practice.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

It uses a common low-level keyboard hook to record keystrokes and writes the logs to local files.\"\nGolden Chickens, also known as Venom Spider, is the name given to a financially motivated threat actor linked to a\nnotorious\nmalware family called\nMore_eggs\n. It's known to be active since at least 2018, offering its warez under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model.\nAs of 2023, Golden Chickens has been attributed to an online persona known as badbullzvenom, an account that's believed to be operated jointly by individuals from\nCanada\nand\nRomania\n. Some of the other malicious tools developed by the e-crime group include More_eggs lite (oka lite_more_eggs), VenomLNK, TerraLoader, and TerraCrypt.\nLate last year, Zscaler ThreatLabz\ndetailed\nnew Golden Chickens-related activity involving a backdoor called RevC2 and a loader referred to as Venom Loader, both of which are delivered via a VenomLNK.\nThe latest findings from Recorded Future show that the threat actors are continuing to work on their offerings, releasing an updated version of their stealer malware that's capable of harvesting data from browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser extensions.\nTerraStealerV2 has been distributed via various formats, such as executable files (EXEs), dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), Windows Installer packages (MSI), and shortcut (LNK) files.\nIn all these cases, the stealer payload is delivered in the form of an OCX (short for Microsoft's OLE Control Extension) payload that's retrieved from an external domain (\"wetransfers[.]io\").\n\"While it targets the Chrome 'Login Data' database to steal credentials, it does not bypass Application Bound Encryption (\nABE\n) protections introduced in Chrome updates after July 2024, indicating the malware code is outdated or still under development,\" the cybersecurity company said.\nThe data captured by TerraStealerV2 is exfiltrated to both Telegram and the domain \"wetransfers[.]io.\" It also leverages trusted Windows utilities, such as regsvr32.exe and mshta.exe, to evade detection.\nTerraLogger, also propagated as an OCX file, is engineered to record keystrokes. However, it does not include functionality for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, suggesting it is either in early development or intended to be used in conjunction with another malware part of the Golden Chickens MaaS ecosystem.\n\"The current state of TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger suggests that both tools remain under active development and do not yet exhibit the level of stealth typically associated with mature Golden Chickens tooling,\" Recorded Future said.\n\"Given Golden Chickens' history of developing malware for credential theft and access operations, these capabilities will likely continue to evolve.\"\nThe disclosure comes amid the emergence of new stealer malware families like\nHannibal Stealer\n,\nGremlin Stealer\n, and\nNullpoint Stealer\nwhich are designed to exfiltrate a wide range of sensitive information from its victims.\nIt also follows the discovery of an updated version of the\nStealC\nmalware with support for streamlined command-and-control (C2) communication protocol and the addition of RC4 encryption.\n\"The malware's payload delivery options have been expanded to include Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) packages and PowerShell scripts,\" Zscaler ThreatLabz\nsaid\nin a report published last week.\n\"A redesigned control panel provides an integrated builder that enables threat actors to customize payload delivery rules based on geolocation, hardware IDs (HWID), and installed software.

        "Content": "A new \"Bring Your Own Installer\" EDR bypass technique is exploited in attacks to bypass SentinelOne's tamper protection feature, allowing threat actors to disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) agents to install the Babuk ransomware.\nThis technique exploits a gap in the agent upgrade process that allows the threat actors to terminate running EDR agents, leaving devices unprotected.\nThe attack was discovered by John Ailes and Tim Mashni of Aon's Stroz Friedberg Incident Response team during an engagement with a customer who suffered a ransomware attack earlier this year.\nThe technique does not rely on third-party tools or drivers like we normally see with EDR bypasses but instead abuses the SentinelOne installer itself.\nSentinelOne recommends customers enable the \"Online Authorization\" setting, which is turned off by default, to mitigate this attack.\n\"We want to get the word out to ensure SentinelOne's customers know to enable Local Upgrade protection,\" John Ailes, Manager, Aon's Stroz Friedberg DFIR, told BleepingComputer.\n\"We've investigated environments with SentinelOne since their guidance was sent to customers and have seen clients that still don't have it enabled. At the end of the day, getting the word out to mitigate this bypass is the most important thing.\"\nActively exploited in ransomware attacks\nThe Stroz Friedberg researchers explain that SentinelOne protects its EDR agent with an anti-tamper protection feature that requires a manual action in the SentinelOne management console or a unique code to remove an agent.\nHowever, like many other software installers, when installing a different version of the agent, the SentinelOne installer terminates any associated Windows processes just before existing files are overwritten with the new version.\nThreat actors discovered they could exploit this small window of opportunity by running a legitimate SentinelOne installer and then forcefully terminating the install process after it shuts down the running agent's services, leaving devices unprotected.\nBring Your Own Installer EDR bypass attack chain\nSource: Stroz Friedberg\nEarlier this year, Stroz Friedberg was engaged to investigate an attack on a customer's network, with logs showing that the attackers gained administrative access to the customer's network through a vulnerability.\nThe attackers then used this new bypass by terminating the SentinelOne Windows Installer (\"\nmsiexec.exe\n\") process before it could install and launch the new version of the agent. With protections disabled on the device, the threat actors were then able to deploy the ransomware.\nIn a conversation with BleepingComputer, Ailes said that threat actors can utilize new or older versions of the agent to conduct this attack, so even if the latest version runs on devices, they are still vulnerable.\n\"Stroz Friedberg also observed that the host went offline in the SentinelOne management console shortly after the installer was terminated,\" warns\nStroz Friedberg's report\n.\n\"Further testing showed that the attack was successful across multiple versions of the SentinelOne agent and was not dependent on the specific versions observed in this incident.\"\nStroz Friedberg responsibly disclosed this attack to SentinelOne, who privately shared mitigations with customers in January 2025.\nThe mitigation is to enable the \"Online Authorization\" feature in the Sentinel Policy settings that, when enabled, requires approval from the SentinelOne management console before local upgrades, downgrades, or uninstalls of the agent can occur.\nSentinelOne also shared Stroz Friedberg's advisory on this new technique with all other major EDR vendors, in case they were also affected.\nPalo Alto Networks confirmed to Stroz Friedberg that this attack did not impact its EDR software.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nRansomware gang encrypted network from a webcam to bypass EDR\nUK shares security tips after major retail cyberattacks\nFBI: Ransomware gangs hack casinos via 3rd party gaming vendors\nUS indicts Black Kingdom ransomware admin for Microsoft Exchange attacks\nUkrainian extradited to US for Nefilim ransomware attacks"

However, as highlighted in Microsoft's report, in many cases, the default settings in those charts lack proper security measures.\nUsers inexperienced with cloud security often deploy those Helm charts as they are, unintentionally exposing services to the internet and allowing attackers to scan and exploit misconfigured applications.\nApache Pinot Helm chart instructions\nSource: Microsoft\n\"Default configurations that lack proper security controls create a severe security threat,\"\nwarns the Microsoft researchers\n.\n\"Without carefully reviewing the YAML manifests and Helm charts, organizations may unknowingly deploy services lacking any form of protection, leaving them fully exposed to attackers.\"\n\"This is particularly concerning when the deployed application can query sensitive APIs or allow administrative actions, which is exactly what we will shortly see.\"\nThe researchers highlight three cases of Helm charts that put Kubernetes environments at risk of attacks, summarized as follows.\nApache Pinot\n: Exposes core services (pinot-controller and pinot-broker) via Kubernetes LoadBalancer services without any authentication.\nMeshery\n: Public sign-up is allowed from exposed IP, allowing anyone to register and gain access to cluster operations.\nSelenium Grid\n: A NodePort exposes the service across all nodes in a cluster, relying only on external firewall rules for protection. The issue doesn't impact the official Helm chart, but many widely referenced GitHub projects.\nConcerning Selenium Grid, Wiz and other cybersecurity firms have\npreviously observed\nattacks targeting misconfigured instances to deploy XMRig miners to mine Monero cryptocurrency.\nTo mitigate the risks, Microsoft recommends carefully reviewing the default configuration of Helm charts to evaluate it from a security perspective, ensuring that it includes authentication and network isolation.\nAdditionally, it is recommended to perform regular scans for misconfigurations that expose workload interfaces publicly and closely monitor containers for suspicious activity.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nGitHub expands security tools after 39 million secrets leaked in 2024\nWhatsApp unveils 'Private Processing' for cloud-based AI features\nHackers ramp up scans for leaked Git tokens and secrets\nLinux 'io_uring' security blindspot allows stealthy rootkit attacks\nASUS warns of critical auth bypass flaw in routers using AiCloud"

The attack\ndisrupted online orders\n, contactless payments, and the company's Click & Collect service.\nLast week,\nCo-op reported\nanother cyber incident, restricting VPN access as a precaution. While initially implying they fended off the breach,\nCo-op confirmed on Friday\nthat \"significant\" amounts of customer data were stolen in the attack.\nOn May 1,\nHarrods confirmed\nthat threat actors tried to breach its network, prompting restrictions on internet access—suggesting an active response, though no breach was confirmed.\nAll three breaches were\nclaimed by the DragonForce operation\n, with BleepingComputer learning that the threat actors utilized the same social engineering attack to breach both M&S and Co-op.\nWhile ransomware was deployed at M&S, Co-op was able to detect and stop the attack before the encryptors could be deployed\nNCSC's security advisory comes shortly after the agency\nwarned\nthat these attacks should be taken as a \"wake-up call\" by all large businesses in the country, as they could be the next target in the hackers' crosshairs.\nAttribution murky\nAt this time, the NCSC has opted not to speculate on who the attackers are and is still working with victims to determine that.\n\"Whilst we have insights, we are not yet in a position to say if these attacks are linked, if this is a concerted campaign by a single actor, or whether there is no link between them at all,\"\nstated NCSC\n.\n\"We are working with the victims and law enforcement colleagues to ascertain that.\"\nHowever, BleepingComputer has learned that both the M&S and Co-op attacks have been attributed to\nhackers utilizing tactics\ncommonly associated with Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and other threat actors who frequent the same Telegram channels, Discord servers, and hacking forums.\nThe attacks on both Marks & Spencer and Co-op started with threat actors impersonating employees while contacting the company's IT help desk staff. They then used social engineering to convince the help desk to reset the impersonated employee's credentials so they could gain access to the network.\nThis is why the NCSC recommends that all companies review their help desk process to detect and block these types of breaches.\n\"Review helpdesk password reset processes, including how the helpdesk authenticates staff members credentials before resetting passwords, especially those with escalated privileges,\" advised the NCSC.\nUltimately, the NCSC says there are still a lot of unknowns, but also a lot they know, so some information may be withheld from publication so as not to impact the ongoing investigations and/or response.\nSecurity recommendations\nThe NCSC has published a list of security recommendations for UK businesses to follow and mitigate the risk.\nThese can be summarized as follows:\nDeploy multi-factor authentication (MFA) comprehensively across all systems.\nMonitor for unauthorized account use, especially risky logins flagged in Microsoft Entra ID Protection.\nRegularly audit Domain, Enterprise, and Cloud Admin accounts to verify legitimate access.\nReview helpdesk procedures to ensure strong identity verification before password resets.\nEnable your security team to detect logins from unusual sources like residential VPNs.\nThe agency urges organizations of all sizes to prepare for the worst, as attackers could test their defenses next.\nCybersecurity experts\nKevin Beaumont\nand\nWill Thomas\n, who have both been tracking these attacks, have also shared tips on detecting and blocking these types of threat actors.\nIt is strongly advised that all companies, regardless of your country, follow this guidance to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nCo-op confirms data theft after DragonForce ransomware claims attack\nUK NCSC: Cyberattacks impacting UK retailers are a wake-up call\nMicrosoft: Octo Tempest is one of the most dangerous financial hacking groups\nDragonForce expands ransomware model with white-label branding scheme\nNew \"Bring Your Own Installer\" EDR bypass used in ransomware attack"
