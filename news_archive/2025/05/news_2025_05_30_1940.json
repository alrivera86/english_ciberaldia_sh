        "Content": "A new malware campaign is distributing a novel Rust-based information stealer dubbed EDDIESTEALER using the popular\nClickFix\nsocial engineering tactic initiated via fake CAPTCHA verification pages.\n\"This campaign leverages deceptive CAPTCHA verification pages that trick users into executing a malicious PowerShell script, which ultimately deploys the infostealer, harvesting sensitive data such as credentials, browser information, and cryptocurrency wallet details,\" Elastic Security Labs researcher Jia Yu Chan\nsaid\nin an analysis.\nThe attack chains begin with threat actors compromising legitimate websites with malicious JavaScript payloads that serve bogus CAPTCHA check pages, which prompt site visitors to \"prove you are not [a] robot\" by following a three-step process, a prevalent tactic called\nClickFix\n.\nThis involves instructing the potential victim to open the Windows Run dialog prompt, paste an already copied command into the \"verification window\" (i.e., the Run dialog), and press enter. This effectively causes the obfuscated PowerShell command to be executed, resulting in the retrieval of a next-stage payload from an external server (\"llll[.]fit\").\nThe JavaScript payload (\"gverify.js\") is subsequently saved to the victim's Downloads folder and executed using cscript in a hidden window. The main goal of the intermediate script is to fetch the EDDIESTEALER binary from the same remote server and store it in the Downloads folder with a pseudorandom 12-character file name.\nWritten in Rust, EDDIESTEALER is a commodity stealer malware that can gather system metadata, receive tasks from a command-and-control (C2) server, and siphon data of interest from the infected host. The exfiltration targets include cryptocurrency wallets, web browsers, password managers, FTP clients, and messaging apps.\n\"These targets are subject to change as they are configurable by the C2 operator,\" Elastic explained. \"EDDIESTEALER then reads the targeted files using standard kernel32.dll functions like CreateFileW, GetFileSizeEx, ReadFile, and CloseHandle.\"\nThe collected host information is encrypted and transmitted to the C2 server in a separate HTTP POST request after the completion of each task.\nBesides incorporating string encryption, the malware employs a custom WinAPI lookup mechanism for resolving API calls and creates a mutex to ensure that only one version is running at any given time. It also incorporates checks to determine if it's being executed in a sandboxed environment, and if so, deletes itself from disk.\n\"Based on a similar\nself-deletion technique\nobserved in\nLatrodectus\n, EDDIESTEALER is capable of deleting itself through NTFS Alternate Data Streams renaming, to bypass file locks,\" Elastic noted.\nAnother noteworthy feature built into the stealer is its ability to bypass Chromium's\napp-bound encryption\nto gain access to unencrypted sensitive data, such as cookies. This is accomplished by including a Rust implementation of\nChromeKatz\n, an open-source tool that can dump cookies and credentials from the memory of Chromium-based browsers.\nThe Rust version of ChromeKatz also incorporates changes to handle scenarios where the targeted Chromium browser is not running. In such cases, it spawns a new browser instance using the command-line arguments \"--window-position=-3000,-3000 https://google.com,\" effectively positioning the new window far off-screen and making its invisible to the user.\nIn opening the browser, the\nobjective\nis to enable the malware to read the memory associated with the\nnetwork service child process\nof Chrome that's identified by the \"-utility-sub-type=network.mojom.NetworkService\" flag and ultimately extract the credentials.\nElastic said it also identified updated versions of the malware with features to harvest running processes, GPU information, number of CPU cores, CPU name, and CPU vendor. In addition, the new variants tweak the C2 communication pattern by preemptively sending the host information to the server before receiving the task configuration.\nThat's not all. The encryption key used for client-to-server communication is hard-coded into the binary, as opposed to retrieving it dynamically from the server. Furthermore, the stealer has been found to launch a new Chrome process with the --remote-debugging-port=<port_num> flag to enable DevTools Protocol over a local WebSocket interface so as to interact with the browser in a headless manner, without requiring any user interaction.\n\"This adoption of Rust in malware development reflects a growing trend among threat actors seeking to leverage modern language features for enhanced stealth, stability, and resilience against traditional analysis workflows and threat detection engines,\" the company said.\nThe disclosure comes as c/side\nrevealed\ndetails of a ClickFix campaign that targets multiple platforms, such as Apple macOS, Android, and iOS, using techniques like browser-based redirections, fake UI prompts, and drive-by download techniques.\nThe attack chain starts with an obfuscated JavaScript hosted on a website, that when visited from macOS, initiates a series of redirections to a page that guides victims to launch Terminal and run a shell script, which leads to the download of a stealer malware that has been\nflagged\non VirusTotal as the Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS).\nHowever, the same campaign has been configured to initiate a drive-by download scheme when visiting the web page from an Android, iOS, or Windows device, leading to the deployment of another\ntrojan malware\n.\nThe disclosures coincide with the emergence of new stealer malware families like Katz Stealer and AppleProcessHub Stealer targeting Windows and macOS respectively, and are capable of harvesting a wide range of information from infected hosts, according to Nextron and Kandji.\nKatz Stealer, like EDDIESTEALER, is engineered to circumvent Chrome's app-bound encryption, but in a different way by employing\nDLL injection\nto obtain the\nencryption key\nwithout administrator privileges and use it to decrypt encrypted cookies and passwords from Chromium-based browsers.\n\"Attackers conceal malicious JavaScript in gzip files, which, when opened, trigger the download of a PowerShell script,\" Nextron\nsaid\n. \"This script retrieves a .NET-based loader payload, which injects the stealer into a legitimate process. Once active, it exfiltrates stolen data to the command and control server.\"\nAppleProcessHub Stealer, on the other hand, is designed to exfiltrate user files including bash history, zsh history, GitHub configurations, SSH information, and iCloud Keychain.\nAttack sequences distributing the malware entail the use of a Mach-O binary that downloads a second-stage bash stealer script from the server \"appleprocesshub[.]com\" and runs it, the results of which are then exfiltrated back to the C2 server. Details of the malware were first shared by the\nMalwareHunterTeam\non May 15, 2025, and by MacPaw's\nMoonlock Lab\nlast week.\n\"This is an example of a Mach-O written in Objective-C which communicates with a command and control server to execute scripts,\" Kandji researcher Christopher Lopez\nsaid\n.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Breaking Out of the Security Mosh Pit\nWhen Jason Elrod, CISO of MultiCare Health System, describes legacy healthcare IT environments, he doesn't mince words: \"Healthcare loves to walk backwards into the future. And this is how we got here, because there are a lot of things that we could have prepared for that we didn't, because we were so concentrated on where we were.\"\nThis chaotic approach has characterized healthcare IT for decades. In a sector where lives depend on technology working flawlessly 24/7/365, security teams have traditionally functioned as gatekeepers—the \"Department of No\"—focused on protection at the expense of innovation and care delivery.\nBut as healthcare continues its digital transformation journey, this approach is no longer sustainable. With 14 hospitals, hundreds of urgent care clinics, and nearly 30,000 employees serving millions of patients, MultiCare needed a different path forward – one that didn't sacrifice innovation for safety. That shift began with a mindset change at the top that was driven by years of experience navigating these exact tensions.\nJason Elrod's View: The Healthcare Security Conundrum\nAfter 15+ years as a healthcare CISO, Elrod has a unique perspective on the security challenges facing healthcare organizations. According to him, healthcare's specific operational realities create security dilemmas unlike any other industry:\nAlways-on operations\n: \"When can you take it down? When can you stop everything and upgrade it?\" asks Elrod. Unlike other industries, healthcare operates 24/7/365 with little room for downtime.\nLife-or-death access requirements\n: \"We have to make sure all the information they need is available when they need it, with the minimum amount of friction possible. Because it's me, it's you, it's our communities, it's our loved ones, it's life or death.\"\nExpanding attack surface\n: With the shift to telemedicine, remote work, and connected medical devices, the threat landscape has expanded dramatically. \"It's like a bowl of spaghetti where each strand needs to be able to talk to one end or the other, but just to the strands it needs to.\"\nMisaligned incentives\n: \"IT historically has been concentrated on availability and speed and access, ubiquitous access… And security says, 'That's a fantastic Lego car you built. Before you can go outside and play with it, I'm going to stick a bunch more Legos on top of it called security, privacy, and compliance.'\"\nIt's a recipe for burnout, blame, and breakdowns. But what if security could enable care instead of obstructing it?\nWatch how MultiCare turned that possibility into practice in the Elisity Microsegmentation Platform case study with Jason Elrod, CISO, MultiCare Health System.\nIdentity: The Key to Modern Healthcare Security\nThe breakthrough for MultiCare came with the implementation of identity-based\nmicrosegmentation\nthrough Elisity.\n\"The biggest attack surface is the identity of every individual,\" notes Elrod. \"Why are the attacks always on identity? Because in healthcare, we must make sure all the information is available when they need it, with the minimum amount of friction possible.\"\nTraditional network segmentation approaches relied on complex VLANs, firewalls, and endpoint agents. The result? \"A Byzantine spaghetti mess\" that became increasingly difficult to manage and update.\nElisity's approach changed this paradigm by focusing on identity rather than network location:\nDynamic security policies that follow users, workloads, and devices wherever they appear on the network\nGranular access controls that create security perimeters around individual assets\nPolicy enforcement points that leverage existing infrastructure to implement microsegmentation without requiring new hardware, agents, or complex network reconfigurations\nFrom Skepticism to Transformation\nWhen Elrod first introduced Elisity to his team, they responded with healthy skepticism. \"They're like, 'Did you hit your head? Are you sure you read what you were saying? I thought you stopped drinking,'\" Elrod recalls.\nThe technical teams were doubtful that such a microsegmentation solution could work with their existing infrastructure. \"They said, 'That doesn't sound like something that can be done,'\" shares Elrod.\nBut seeing was believing. \"When you see people who are deeply technical, people who just know their craft really well, and they see something and go 'Wow'… it shakes the pillars of their opinions about what can be done,\" explains Elrod.\nThe Elisity solution delivered on its promises:\nRapid implementation without disruptive network changes\nReal-time automated or manual policy adjustments that previously took weeks to implement\nComprehensive visibility across previously siloed environments\nEnhanced security posture without compromising availability\n...all without forcing a tradeoff between protection and performance.\nBut what surprised Elrod most wasn't just what the technology did, but how it changed the people using it.[JE2]\nBreaking Down Walls Between Teams\nPerhaps the most unexpected benefit was how the solution transformed relationships between teams.\n\"There's been a friction point. Put this control and constraint around the network. Who's the first person to call? They're going to call IT. 'I can't do this thing.' And I'm saying, 'Well, you can't open everything, because everybody can't have everything. Because the bad guys will have everything then,'\" Elrod explains.\nIdentity-based microsegmentation changed this dynamic:\n\"It changed from 'How do I get around you?' and 'How do you get around me?' to cooperation. Because now it's like, 'Oh, well, let's make that change together.' It shifted culturally, and this was not something I expected… We really are on the same team. This is a solution that works for all of us, makes all of our jobs better, Security and IT. It is a force multiplier across the organization,\" says Elrod.\nWith Elisity, security and IT teams now share incentives rather than competing priorities. \"The same thing that allows me to make connectivity work between this area and here in a frictionless fashion is also the same exact thing that provides the rationalized security around it. Same tool, same dashboard, same team,\" Elrod notes.\nEnabling a Culture of Yes\nFor healthcare providers, the impact is profound. \"If they don't have to worry about access, don't have to worry about the controls, they can take the cognitive load of thinking and worrying about the compliance factors of it, the security, the privacy, the technology underlying the table that they're working on,\" says Elrod.\nThis shift enables a fundamental change in how security interacts with clinical staff:\nSpeed of delivery\n: \"We can do that at the speed of need as opposed to the speed of bureaucracy, the speed of technology, the speed of legacy,\" explains Elrod.\nGranular control\n: \"How would you like your own segment on the network, wherever you may roam? I can base it on your identity, wherever you're at,\" Elrod shares.\nEnhanced trust\n: \"Being able to instill that confidence that, 'Hey, it's secure, it's stable, it's scalable, it's functional, we can support it. And we can move at the pace that you want to move at.'\"\nBreaking Down Silos: The Business Imperative of Security-IT Integration\nThe traditional separation between security and IT operations teams is rapidly becoming obsolete as organizations recognize the strategic advantages of integration. Recent research demonstrates compelling business benefits for enterprises that successfully bridge this divide, particularly for those in manufacturing, industrial, and healthcare sectors.\nAccording to Skybox Security (2025), 76% of organizations believe miscommunication between network and security teams has negatively impacted their security posture. This disconnect creates tangible security risks and operational inefficiencies. Conversely, organizations with unified security and IT operations reported 30% fewer significant security incidents compared to those with siloed teams.\nFor healthcare organizations, the stakes are even higher. Among healthcare institutions that experienced ransomware attacks, those with siloed security and IT operations reported a 28% increase in patient mortality rates in 2024, up from 23% in 2023 (Ponemon Institute & Proofpoint, 2024). This stark reality underscores that cybersecurity integration isn't just an operational consideration—it's a patient safety imperative.\nThe financial case for integration is equally compelling. A Forrester Total Economic Impact study on ServiceNow Security Operations solutions demonstrated a 238% ROI and $6.2 million in present value benefits, with a 6-month payback period when integrating security and IT operations (Forrester/ServiceNow, 2024).\nForward-thinking organizations are adopting sophisticated integration models like Cyber Fusion Centers. Gartner research confirms these represent a significant advancement over traditional security operations, predicting that by 2028, 20% of large enterprises will shift to cyber-fraud fusion teams to combat internal and external adversaries, up from less than 5% in 2023.\nFor enterprise leaders, the message is clear: breaking down operational silos between security and IT teams isn't just good practice—it's essential for comprehensive protection, operational efficiency, and competitive advantage in today's threat landscape. Few understand that better than Elrod, who's spent decades trying to bridge this gap both technologically and culturally.\nThe Bridge to Modern Healthcare\nFor Elrod, identity-based microsegmentation represents more than just a technology solution—it's a bridge between where healthcare has been and where it needs to go.\n\"Technology in the past wasn't bought because it was crappy… They were great. Good intention. They did what they needed to do at the time. But there's a lot of temporal distance between now and when that made sense,\" he explains.\nElisity helps MultiCare \"build that bridge from where we have been to where we need to go… It's a ladder out of the pit. This is great. Let's stop throwing things in there. Let's actually do things in a rational fashion,\" says Elrod.\nLooking Ahead\nWhile no single solution can address all of healthcare's security challenges, identity-based microsegmentation is \"one of the bricks on the yellow brick road to making healthcare security and technology the culture of Yes,\" according to Elrod.\nAs healthcare organizations continue to balance security requirements with the need for frictionless care delivery, solutions that align these competing priorities will become increasingly essential.\nBy implementing identity-based microsegmentation, MultiCare has transformed security from a barrier to an enabler of modern healthcare—proving that with the right approach, it's possible to create a culture where \"yes\" is the default response without compromising security or compliance.\nReady to escape your own security \"mosh pit\" and build a bridge to modern healthcare?

The average loss is estimated to be over $150,000 per individual.\nFunnull, also called Fang Neng CDN (funnull[.]io, funnull[.]com, funnull[.]app, and funnull[.]buzz), was first attracted the attention of the cybersecurity community in June 2024 after it was\nimplicated\nin the supply chain attack of widely-used Polyfill[.]io JavaScript library.\nLast year, an analysis by Silent Push\nrevealed\nthat the infrastructure associated with Funnull has been used to promote investment scams, fake trading applications, and suspect gambling networks. The infrastructure has been codenamed Triad Nexus.\nThen earlier this February, the cybersecurity company\nattributed\nFunnull to a practice dubbed infrastructure laundering wherein the company rented IP addresses from mainstream hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure to host criminal websites.\nHighlighting this aspect, the Treasury said Funnull enables virtual currency investment scams by acquiring IP addresses in bulk from major cloud services companies across the world and selling them to cybercriminals to host scam platforms and other malicious web content.\n\"Funnull generates domain names for websites on its purchased IP addresses using domain generation algorithms (DGAs) – programs that generate large numbers of similar but unique names for websites – and provides web design templates to cybercriminals,\" the agency pointed out.\n\"These services not only make it easier for cybercriminals to impersonate trusted brands when creating scam websites but also allow them to quickly change to different domain names and IP addresses when legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down.\"\nThe Treasury also accused Funnull of purchasing Polyfill[.]io with the intent to redirect visitors of legitimate websites to scam websites and online gambling sites, some of which it said are linked to Chinese criminal money laundering operations.\nFurthermore, the department alleged that its administrator Liu, a Chinese national, was in possession of spreadsheets and other documents that contained information about the company's employees, their performance, and their work progress.\nThe tasks assigned to them included assigning domain names to criminal actors for virtual currency investment fraud, phishing scams, and online gambling sites.\nIn a standalone flash alert, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said it identified 548 unique Funnull Canonical Names (CNAME) linked to over 332,000 unique domains since January 2025.\n\"Between October 2023 and April 2025, multiple patterns of IP address activity were observed from several domains using Funnull infrastructure,\" the FBI\nsaid\n. \"During this time frame, hundreds of domains using Funnull infrastructure simultaneously migrated from one IP address to another either on the same exact day or within the same timeframe.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Many of these accounts posed as female journalists and pro-Palestine activists.\n\"The operation also used popular hashtags like #palestine, #gaza, #starbucks, #instagram in their posts, as part of its spammy tactics in an attempt to insert themselves in the existing public discourse,\" Meta said.\n\"The operators posted in Azeri about news and current events, including the Paris Olympics, Israel's 2024 pager attacks, a boycott of American brands, and criticisms of the U.S., President Biden, and Israel's actions in Gaza.\"\nThe activity has been attributed to a known threat activity cluster dubbed\nStorm-2035\n, which Microsoft described in August 2024 as an Iranian network targeting U.S. voter groups with \"polarizing messaging\" on presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, and the Israel-Hamas conflict.\nIn the intervening months, artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI also revealed that it banned ChatGPT accounts created by Storm-2035 to weaponize its chatbot for generating content to be shared on social media.\nLastly, Meta revealed that it removed 157 Facebook accounts, 19 Pages, one Group, and 17 accounts on Instagram to target audiences in Myanmar, Taiwan, and Japan. The threat actors behind the operation have been found to use AI to create profile photos and run an \"account farm\" to spin up new fake accounts.\nThe Chinese-origin activity encompassed three separate clusters, each reposting other users' and their own content in English, Burmese, Mandarin, and Japanese about news and current events in the countries they targeted.\n\"In Myanmar, they posted about the need to end the ongoing conflict, criticized the civil resistance movements and shared supportive commentary about the military junta,\" the company said.\n\"In Japan, the campaign criticized Japan's government and its military ties with the U.S. In Taiwan, they posted claims that Taiwanese politicians and military leaders are corrupt, and ran Pages claiming to display posts submitted anonymously -- in a likely attempt to create the impression of an authentic discourse.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Summary": "Pentesting isn't just about finding flaws — it's about knowing which ones matter. Pentera's 2025 State of Pentesting report uncovers which assets attackers target most, where security teams are making progress, and which exposures still fly under the radar. Focus on reducing breach impact, not just breach count. [...]",
        "Date": "2025-05-30",
        "Content": "Results from Pentera’s 4th\nPentesting report\n, which surveyed around 500 CISOs globally, show that while Exposure Management practices are maturing, there are still some gaps the market is yet to address.\nThe modern attack surface is sprawling, dynamic, distributed, and dangerously opaque. As enterprises expand into cloud-native or hybrid architectures, deploy APIs by the thousands, and integrate IoT and OT devices into core operations, the surface area for cyber threats grows both in size and complexity. Today, the average enterprise manages 75 security tools, and nearly half of CISOs report continued growth in their security stacks year over year.\nThis complexity isn’t deterring attackers. It enables them. Threat actors operate opportunistically. No surface is safe because attackers are driven to exploit whatever is exposed; they’re ultimately motivated to target surfaces that are relatively weaker than the next.  For security leaders, this means it’s not a question of how to cover more ground, but where to focus for maximum security - where across the attack surface is the threat of risk most implicated?\nThe recently released\n2025 State of Pentesting\nreport by\nPentera\nreveals the relative vulnerability of different attack surfaces, from cloud infrastructure and web-facing assets to APIs, endpoints, and even IoT systems. CISOs from 500 enterprises were asked where across their network they perceive risk, where pentesting efforts are directed, and which areas were ultimately breached.\nThe results provide insight for security teams to sharpen their focus, direct their testing strategies, and close the riskiest exposures faster.\nAttend Xposure! The National Exposure Management vSummit\nTake a proactive approach to managing and reducing cyber risk, gain expert insights from cybersecurity leaders on securing enterprise-wide networks, and hear how top industry players are implementing the stages of Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM).\nXposure delivers a forward-thinking approach to cyber resilience.\nRegister Now\nThe Little Realized Truth about Exposure Management\nEven with the best-run exposure management programs, breaches still occur. But working within more mature security programs, you realize\na breach doesn’t always mean compromise\n.\nTake the example of an exposed asset. It might be breached in the technical sense—perhaps even with a threat actor establishing a foothold on it.. But if that asset isn’t tied to sensitive data, production systems, or critical services, the real-world impact is negligible.\nNot all breaches are equal\n. That’s the foundational mindset shift exposure management brings.\nUnlike traditional vulnerability management, where teams are chasing down CVEs based on severity scores or ticket age, exposure management is strategic. It considers both\nexploitability\nand\nimpact\nto determine what vulnerabilities actually matter. This dual lens allows teams to bypass the noise and zero-in on the exposures that can lead to devastating compromise.\nThe State of Pentesting report reinforces this truth. Despite nearly 67% of enterprises reporting a breach in the past two years, only 36% faced downtime, 30% suffered data exposure, and 28% incurred financial loss. That means a significant portion of “breaches” had little or no operational consequence. The goal isn't to eliminate every breach - but only the ones that will hurt you.\nWeb-Facing Assets - Still the Weakest Link\nIf exposure management is about aligning remediation with risk, web-facing assets are the prime example of a cautionary tale.\nAccording to the data, web-facing assets top all three metrics: they’re perceived as the most vulnerable (45%), tested the most (57%), and breached the most frequently (30%).\nIn some ways this is encouraging. It shows that security teams are accurately prioritizing external assets, recognizing them as both accessible and attractive targets, and directing pentesting efforts accordingly.\nBut despite all that attention, attackers are still getting in.\nWhy? Because just on the basis of exposure, web-facing assets are risky. These systems - DNS, web portals, and login pages are designed to be reachable. Their openness makes them “low-hanging fruit,” especially when misconfigurations, exposed services, or open ports are left unchecked and without compensating controls such as MFA.\nYet this doesn’t mean failure.\nIf attackers breach a public-facing asset and reach a dead end - no access to sensitive systems, no valuable data, no lateral movement - then, so what? The breach had no impact. In exposure management, it’s not just about reducing breach rates - it’s about reducing the impact of breaches that do occur.\nInternal Networks, Endpoints, and Applications - A Contained Front\nWhen it comes to systems closest to the crown jewels, organizations are getting it right. They’re widely tested (48%) considered vulnerable (32%), and are seeing low breach rates (16%).\nInternal networks, endpoints, and applications each rank in the top tier for pentesting activity and show comparatively low breach rates, 16% for internal networks, 13% for endpoints, and 15% for applications. All suggesting a payoff in focused effort.\nThese are systems that house sensitive data, power operations, and represent a clear path to lateral movement or privilege escalation. Their perceived criticality earns them a greater level of focus and attention, with layered security controls and tooling that’s more mature. It also reflects something deeper: exposure management maturity. Organizations aren’t just scanning these systems for vulnerabilities, they’re pentesting them in context, prioritizing based on potential impact, and validating to confirm that defenses hold under pressure.\nAPI Risk - Shows Gap Between Perception and Reality\nAPIs sit at the intersection of business logic and backend systems. They’re essential, deeply integrated, and often overlooked, with data from the survey report indicating APIs may be more vulnerable than security teams realize.\nWhile APIs are tested at a similar rate to internal networks (48%), they show a higher breach rate, 21%, compared to 16% for internal networks. That gap suggests a disconnect: either the perceived risk of APIs is too low, or current testing approaches aren’t revealing the full picture.\nThe challenge is complexity. APIs are dynamic, hard to inventory, and notoriously difficult to test well. Their attack surface isn’t just about ports or endpoints, it’s about logic flaws, broken authentication, and misconfigured integrations, all leading to attack pathways that don’t show up in a standard scan.\nAPIs also frequently bridge systems, whether between cloud services, third-party tools, mobile apps, and internal databases. That makes them prime targets for lateral movement or data exfiltration. And their visibility gap makes them especially attractive to attackers who understand how to move below the radar.\nClosing the gap means leveling up testing, both in terms of frequency and depth. Continuous,  adversarial testing of APIs is essential to expose integration flaws that traditional methods appear to be missing.\nExposure Management Shows Encouraging Signs of Alignment\nThe 2025 State of Pentesting report confirms what we’ve known for years - closer proximity to business risk drives sharper execution.\nThere’s growing alignment between perceived risk, pentesting activity, and breaches. A strong signal that exposure management practices are maturing, as teams are minimising the gap between assumed and actual risk.\nThe goal of exposure management isn’t to prevent every breach. It’s to prevent the ones that matter. By combining data-driven prioritization with continuous validation, security teams can focus on real exposures, not theoretical threats. Ensuring that when the attacker comes knocking, there’s nothing valuable behind that door.\nTo learn more about how leading enterprises are implementing their Exposure Management programs, attend\nXposure\n, the National Exposure Management vSummit.\nRegister Now\nSponsored and written by\nPentera\n."

        "Content": "Image: Shutterstock, ArtHead.\nThe U.S. government today imposed economic sanctions on Funnull Technology Inc., a Philippines-based company that provides computer infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of websites involved in virtual currency investment scams known as “pig butchering.” In January 2025, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how Funnull was being used as a content delivery network that catered to cybercriminals seeking to route their traffic through U.S.-based cloud providers.\n“Americans lose billions of dollars annually to these cyber scams, with revenues generated from these crimes rising to record levels in 2024,” reads a statement from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which sanctioned Funnull and its 40-year-old Chinese administrator Liu Lizhi. “Funnull has directly facilitated several of these schemes, resulting in over $200 million in U.S. victim-reported losses.”\nThe Treasury Department said Funnull’s operations are linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI. The agency said Funnull directly facilitated pig butchering and other schemes that resulted in more than $200 million in financial losses by Americans.\nPig butchering is a rampant form of fraud wherein people are lured by flirtatious strangers online into investing in fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platforms. Victims are coached to invest more and more money into what appears to be an extremely profitable trading platform, only to find their money is gone when they wish to cash out.\nThe scammers often insist that investors pay additional “taxes” on their crypto “earnings” before they can see their invested funds again (spoiler: they never do), and a shocking number of people have lost six figures or more through these pig butchering scams.\nKrebsOnSecurity’s January story on Funnull was based on research from the security firm Silent Push, which discovered in October 2024 that a vast number of domains hosted via Funnull were promoting gambling sites that bore the logo of the Suncity Group, a Chinese entity named in a 2024 UN report (PDF) for laundering millions of dollars for the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus.\nSilent Push found Funnull was a criminal content delivery network (CDN) that carried a great deal of traffic tied to scam websites, funneling the traffic through a dizzying chain of auto-generated domain names and U.S.-based cloud providers before redirecting to malicious or phishous websites. The FBI has released a technical writeup (PDF) of the infrastructure used to manage the malicious Funnull domains between October 2023 and April 2025.\nA graphic from the FBI explaining how Funnull generated a slew of new domains on a regular basis and mapped them to Internet addresses on U.S. cloud providers.\nSilent Push revisited Funnull’s infrastructure in January 2025 and found Funnull was still using many of the same Amazon and Microsoft cloud Internet addresses identified as malicious in its October report. Both Amazon and Microsoft pledged to rid their networks of Funnull’s presence following that story, but according to Silent Push’s Zach Edwards only one of those companies has followed through.\nEdwards said Silent Push no longer sees Microsoft Internet addresses showing up in Funnull’s infrastructure, while Amazon continues to struggle with removing Funnull servers, including one that appears to have first materialized in 2023.\n“Amazon is doing a terrible job — every day since they made those claims to you and us in our public blog they have had IPs still mapped to Funnull, including some that have stayed mapped for inexplicable periods of time,” Edwards said.\nAmazon said its Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosting platform actively counters abuse attempts.\n“We have stopped hundreds of attempts this year related to this group and we are looking into the information you shared earlier today,” reads a statement shared by Amazon. “If anyone suspects that AWS resources are being used for abusive activity, they can report it to AWS Trust & Safety using the report abuse form here.”\n\nU.S. based cloud providers remain an attractive home base for cybercriminal organizations because many organizations will not be overly aggressive in blocking traffic from U.S.-based cloud networks, as doing so can result in blocking access to many legitimate web destinations that are also on that same shared network segment or host.\nWhat’s more, funneling their bad traffic so that it appears to be coming out of U.S. cloud Internet providers allows cybercriminals to connect to websites from web addresses that are geographically close(r) to their targets and victims (to sidestep location-based security controls by your bank, for example).\nFunnull is not the only cybercriminal infrastructure-as-a-service provider that was sanctioned this month: On May 20, 2025, the European Union imposed sanctions on Stark Industries Solutions, an ISP that materialized at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has been used as a global proxy network that conceals the true source of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against enemies of Russia.\nIn May 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on Stark Industries Solutions that found much of the malicious traffic traversing Stark’s network (e.g. vulnerability scanning and password brute force attacks) was being bounced through U.S.-based cloud providers. My reporting showed how deeply Stark had penetrated U.S. ISPs, and that Ivan Neculiti for many years sold “bulletproof” hosting services that told Russian cybercrime forum customers they would proudly ignore any abuse complaints or police inquiries.\nThe homepage of Stark Industries Solutions.\nThat story examined the history of Stark’s co-founders, Moldovan brothers Ivan and Yuri Neculiti, who each denied past involvement in cybercrime or any current involvement in assisting Russian disinformation efforts or cyberattacks. Nevertheless, the EU sanctioned both brothers as well.\nThe EU said Stark and the Neculti brothers “enabled various Russian state-sponsored and state-affiliated actors to conduct destabilising activities including coordinated information manipulation and interference and cyber-attacks against the Union and third countries by providing services intended to hide these activities from European law enforcement and security agencies.”\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Thursday 29th of May 2025 09:55 PM \r\n         \nThis is a stark reminder of how deeply embedded cybercrime infrastructure has become. The fact that Funnull operated through major cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft Azure, facilitating scams that led to over $200 million in U.S. victim losses, is alarming. It underscores the need for cloud services to implement stricter monitoring and verification processes to prevent such abuse\nWhen I hear “imposed economic sanctions” I think of countries.  I wonder what kinds of sanctions are being imposed on the company, and how effective they will be.\nYour email address will not be published.
