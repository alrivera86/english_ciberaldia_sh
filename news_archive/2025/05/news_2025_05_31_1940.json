        "Content": "Two information disclosure flaws have been identified in\napport\nand\nsystemd-coredump\n, the\ncore dump\nhandlers in Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Fedora, according to the Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU).\nTracked as\nCVE-2025-5054 and CVE-2025-4598\n, both vulnerabilities are race condition bugs that could enable a local attacker to obtain access to access sensitive information. Tools like Apport and systemd-coredump are designed to handle crash reporting and core dumps in Linux systems.\n\"These race conditions allow a local attacker to exploit a SUID program and gain read access to the resulting core dump,\" Saeed Abbasi, manager of product at Qualys TRU,\nsaid\n.\nA brief description of the two flaws is below -\nCVE-2025-5054\n(CVSS score: 4.7) - A race condition in Canonical apport package up to and including 2.32.0 that allows a local attacker to leak sensitive information via PID-reuse by leveraging namespaces\nCVE-2025-4598\n(CVSS score: 4.7) - A race condition in systemd-coredump that allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process\nSUID, short for Set User ID, is a\nspecial\nfile permission\nthat allows a user to execute a program with the privileges of its owner, rather than their own permissions.\n\"When analyzing application crashes, apport attempts to detect if the crashing process was running inside a container before performing consistency checks on it,\" Canonical's Octavio Galland\nsaid\n.\n\"This means that if a local attacker manages to induce a crash in a privileged process and quickly replaces it with another one with the same process ID that resides inside a mount and pid namespace, apport will attempt to forward the core dump (which might contain sensitive information belonging to the original, privileged process) into the namespace.\"\nRed Hat said CVE-2025-4598 has been rated Moderate in severity owing to the high complexity in pulling an exploit for the vulnerability, noting that the attacker has to first the race condition and be in possession of an unprivileged local account.\nAs mitigations, Red Hat said users can run the command \"echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable\" as a root user to disable the ability of a system to generate a core dump for SUID binaries.\nThe \"/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable\" parameter essentially controls whether SUID programs can produce core dumps on the crash. By setting it to zero, it disables core dumps for all SUID programs and prevents them from being analyzed in the event of a crash.\n\"While this mitigates this vulnerability while it's not possible to update the systemd package, it disables the capability of analyzing crashes for such binaries,\" Red Hat\nsaid\n.\nSimilar advisories have been issued by\nAmazon Linux\n,\nDebian\n, and\nGentoo\n. It's worth noting that Debian systems aren't susceptible to CVE-2025-4598 by default, since they don't include any core dump handler unless the systemd-coredump package is manually installed. CVE-2025-4598 does not affect Ubuntu releases.\nQualys has also developed proof-of-concept (PoC) code for both vulnerabilities, demonstrating how a local attacker can exploit the coredump of a crashed unix_chkpwd process, which is used to verify the validity of a user's password, to obtain password hashes from the /etc/shadow file.\nCanonical, in an alert of its own, said the impact of CVE-2025-5054 is restricted to the confidentiality of the memory space of invoked SUID executables and that the PoC exploit can leak hashed user passwords has limited real-world impact.\n\"The exploitation of vulnerabilities in Apport and systemd-coredump can severely compromise the confidentiality at high risk, as attackers could extract sensitive data, like passwords, encryption keys, or customer information from core dumps,\" Abbasi said.\n\"The fallout includes operational downtime, reputational damage, and potential non-compliance with regulations. To mitigate these multifaceted risks effectively, enterprises should adopt proactive security measures by prioritizing patches and mitigations, enforcing robust monitoring, and tightening access controls.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A multinational law enforcement operation has resulted in the takedown of an online cybercrime syndicate that offered services to threat actors to ensure that their malicious software stayed undetected from security software.\nTo that effect, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said it seized four domains and their associated server facilitated the crypting service on May 27, 2025, in partnership with Dutch and Finnish authorities. These include AvCheck[.]net, Cryptor[.]biz, and Crypt[.]guru, all of which now display a seizure notice.\nOther countries that participated in the effort include France, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, and Ukraine.\n\"Crypting is the process of using software to make malware difficult for antivirus programs to detect,\" the DoJ\nsaid\n. \"The seized domains offered services to cybercriminals, including counter-antivirus (CAV) tools. When used together, CAV and crypting services allow criminals to obfuscate malware, making it undetectable and enabling unauthorized access to computer systems.\"\nThe DoJ said authorities made undercover purchases to analyze the services and confirmed that they were being used for cybercrime. In a coordinated announcement, Dutch officials\ncharacterized\nAvCheck as one of the largest CAV services used by bad actors around the world.\nAccording to\nsnapshots\ncaptured by the Internet Archive, AvCheck[.]net billed itself as a \"high-speed antivirus scantime checker,\" offering the ability for registered users to scan their files against 26 antivirus engines, as well as domains and IP addresses with 22 antivirus engines and blocklists.\nThe domain seizures were conducted as part of Operation Endgame, an ongoing global effort launched in 2024 to dismantle cybercrime. It marks the fourth major action in recent weeks after the disruption of\nLumma Stealer\n,\nDanaBot\n, and\nhundreds of domains and servers\nused by various malware families to deliver ransomware.\n\"Cybercriminals don't just create malware; they perfect it for maximum destruction,\" said FBI Houston Special Agent in Charge Douglas Williams. \"By leveraging counter-antivirus services, malicious actors refine their weapons against the world's toughest security systems to better slip past firewalls, evade forensic analysis, and wreak havoc across victims' systems.\"\nThe development comes as eSentire detailed\nPureCrypter\n, a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) solution that's being used to distribute information stealers like Lumma and Rhadamanthys using the ClickFix initial access vector.\nMarketed on Hackforums[.]net by a threat actor named PureCoder for $159 for three months, $399 for one year, or $799 for lifetime access, the crypter is distributed using an automated Telegram channel, @ThePureBot, which also serves as a marketplace for other offerings, including\nPureRAT and PureLogs\n.\nLike other purveyors of such tools, PureCoder requires users to acknowledge a Terms of Service (ToS) agreement that claims the software is meant only for educational purposes and that any violations would result in immediate revocation of their access and serial key.\nThe malware also incorporates the ability to patch the\nNtManageHotPatch API\nin memory on Windows machines running 24H2 or newer to re-enable process hollowing-based code injection. The findings demonstrate how threat actors quickly adapt and devise ways to defeat new security mechanisms.\n\"The malware employs multiple evasion techniques including AMSI bypass, DLL unhooking, anti-VM detection, anti-debugging measures, and recently added capabilities to bypass Windows 11 24H2 security features through NtManageHotPatch API patching,\" the Canadian cybersecurity company\nsaid\n.\n\"The developers use deceptive marketing tactics by promoting 'Fully UnDetected' (FUD) status based on AvCheck[.]net results, while VirusTotal shows detection by multiple AV/EDR solutions, revealing significant discrepancies in detection rates.\"\nFound this article interesting?
