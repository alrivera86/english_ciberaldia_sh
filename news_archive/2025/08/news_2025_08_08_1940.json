        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers are drawing attention to a new campaign that's using legitimate generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered website building tools like DeepSite AI and BlackBox AI to create replica phishing pages mimicking Brazilian government agencies as part of a financially motivated campaign.\nThe activity involves the creation of lookalike sites imitating Brazil's State Department of Traffic and Ministry of Education, which then trick unsuspecting users into making unwarranted payments through the country's PIX payment system, Zscaler ThreatLabz said.\nThese fraudulent sites are artificially boosted using search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning techniques to enhance their visibility, thereby increasing the likelihood of success of the attack.\n\"Source code analysis reveals signatures of generative AI tools, such as overly explanatory comments meant to guide developers, non-functional elements that would typically work on an authentic website, and trends like TailwindCSS styling, which is different from the traditional phishing kits used by threat actors,\" Zscaler's Jagadeeswar Ramanukolanu, Kartik Dixit, and Yesenia Barajas\nsaid\n.\nThe end goal of the attacks is to serve bogus forms that collect sensitive personal information, including Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas (CPF) numbers, Brazilian taxpayer identification numbers, residential addresses, and convince them to make a one-time payment of 87.40 reals ($16) to the threat actors via PIX under the guise of completing a psychometric and medical exam or secure a job offer.\nTo further increase the legitimacy of the campaign, the phishing pages are designed such that they employ staged data collection by progressively requesting additional information from the victim, mirroring the behavior of the authentic websites. The collected CPF numbers are also validated on the backend by means of an API created by the threat actor.\n\"The API domain identified during analysis is registered by the threat actor,\" Zscaler said. \"The API retrieves data associated with the CPF number and automatically populates the phishing page with information linked to the CPF.\"\nThat said, the company noted that it's possible the attackers may have acquired CPF numbers and user details through data breaches or by leveraging publicly exposed APIs with an authentication key, and then used the information to increase the credibility of their phishing attempts.\n\"While these phishing campaigns are currently stealing relatively small amounts of money from victims, similar attacks can be used to cause far more damage,\" Zscaler noted.\nMass mailing Campaign Distributes Efimer Trojan to Steal Crypto\nBrazil has also become the focus of a malspam campaign that impersonates lawyers from a major company to deliver a malicious script called Efimer and steal a victim's cryptocurrency. Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said it detected the mass mailing campaign in June 2025, with early iteration of the malware dating all the way back to October 2024 and spread via infected WordPress websites.\n\"These emails falsely claimed the recipient's domain name infringed on the sender's rights,\" researchers Vladimir Gursky and Artem Ushkov\nsaid\n. \"This script also includes additional functionality that helps attackers spread it further by compromising WordPress sites and hosting malicious files there, among other techniques.\"\nEfimer, besides propagating via compromised WordPress sites and email, leverages malicious torrents as distribution vector, while communicating with its command-and-control (C2) server via the TOR network. Furthermore, the malware can extend its capabilities with additional scripts that can brute-force passwords for WordPress sites and harvest email addresses from specified websites for future email campaigns.\n\"The script receives domains [from the C2 server] and iterates through each one to find hyperlinks and email addresses on the website pages,\" Kaspersky said, noting it also serves as a spam module engineered to fill out contact forms on target websites.\nIn the attack chain documented by Kaspersky, the emails come fitted with ZIP archives containing another password-protected archive and an empty file with a name specifying the password to open it. Present within the second ZIP file is a malicious Windows Script File (WSF) that, when launched, infects the machine with Efimer.\nAt the same time, the victim is displayed an error message stating the document cannot be opened on the device as a distraction mechanism. In reality, the WSF script saves two other files, \"controller.js\" (the trojan component) and \"controller.xml,\" and creates a scheduled task on the host using configuration extracted from \"controller.xml.\"\nThe \"controller.js\" is a clipper malware that's designed to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses the user copies to their clipboard with the wallet address under the attacker's control. It can also capture screenshots and execute additional payloads received from the C2 server by connecting over the TOR network after installing a TOR proxy client on the infected computer.\nKaspersky said it also discovered a second version of Efimer that, along with clipper features, also incorporates anti-VM features and scans web browsers like Google Chrome and Brave for cryptocurrency wallet extensions related to Atomic, Electrum, and Exodus, among others, and exfiltrates the results of the search back to the C2 server.\nThe campaign is estimated to have impacted 5,015 users, based on its telemetry, with a majority of the infections concentrated in Brazil, India, Spain, Russia, Italy, Germany, the U.K., Canada, France, and Portugal.\n\"While its primary goal is to steal and swap cryptocurrency wallets, it can also leverage additional scripts to compromise WordPress sites and distribute spam,\" the researchers said. \"This allows it to establish a complete malicious infrastructure and spread to new devices.\"\n\"Another interesting characteristic of this Trojan is its attempt to propagate among both individual users and corporate environments. In the first case, attackers use torrent files as bait, allegedly to download popular movies; in the other, they send claims about the alleged unauthorized use of words or phrases registered by another company.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "When an organization's credentials are leaked, the immediate consequences are rarely visible—but the long-term impact is far-reaching. Far from the cloak-and-dagger tactics seen in fiction, many real-world cyber breaches begin with something deceptively simple: a username and password.\nAccording\nto Verizon's 2025 Data Breach\nInvestigations Report, leaked credentials accounted for 22% of breaches in 2024, outpacing phishing and even software exploitation. That's nearly a quarter of all incidents, initiated not through zero-days or advanced persistent threats, but by logging in through the front door.\nThis quiet and persistent threat has been growing. New data compiled by Cyberint—an external risk management and threat intelligence company recently acquired by Check Point—shows a 160% increase in leaked credentials in 2025 compared to the previous year. The report, titled\nThe Rise of Leaked Credentials\n, provides a look into not just the volume of these leaks, but how they are exploited and what organizations can do to get ahead of them. It's worth reading in full for those responsible for risk reduction.\nRead the Report:\nThe Rise of Leaked Credentials\nA Surge Fueled by Automation and Accessibility\nThe rise in leaked credentials is not just about volume. It's also about speed and accessibility. In one month alone, Cyberint identified more than 14,000 corporate credential exposures tied to organizations whose password policies were still intact—implying active use and real threat potential.\nAutomation has made credential theft easier. Infostealer malware, often sold as a service, allows even low-skilled attackers to harvest login data from browsers and memory. AI-generated phishing campaigns can mimic tone, language, and branding with uncanny accuracy. Once credentials are gathered, they are either sold on underground marketplaces or offered in bundles on Telegram channels and illicit forums.\nAs outlined in the ebook, the average time it takes to remediate credentials leaked through GitHub repositories is 94 days. That's a three-month window where an attacker could exploit access, undetected.\nHow Credentials Are Used as Currency\nLeaked credentials are currency for attackers—and their value goes beyond the initial login. Once obtained, these credentials become a vector for a range of malicious activity:\nAccount Takeover (ATO):\nAttackers log into a user's account to send phishing emails from a legitimate source, tamper with data, or launch financial scams.\nCredential Stuffing:\nIf a user reuses passwords across services, the breach of one account can lead to others falling in a chain reaction.\nSpam Distribution and Bot Networks:\nEmail and social accounts serve as launchpads for disinformation, spam campaigns, or promotional abuse.\nBlackmail and Extortion:\nSome actors contact victims, threatening to expose credentials unless payment is made. While passwords can be changed, victims often panic if the extent of the breach isn't clear.\nThe downstream effects aren't always obvious. A compromised personal Gmail account, for example, may give attackers access to recovery emails for corporate services, or uncover shared links with sensitive attachments.\nSeeing What Others Miss\nCyberint, now part of Check Point, uses automated collection systems and AI agents to monitor a wide range of sources across the open, deep, and dark web. These systems are designed to detect leaked credentials at scale, correlating details like domain patterns, password reuse, and organizational metadata to identify likely exposure—even when credentials are posted anonymously or bundled with others. Alerts are enriched with context that supports rapid triage, and integrations with SIEM and SOAR platforms enable immediate action, such as revoking credentials or enforcing password resets.\nThen, Cyberint's analysts step in. These teams conduct targeted investigations in closed forums, assess the credibility of threat actor claims, and piece together identity and attribution signals. By combining machine-driven coverage with direct access to underground communities, Cyberint provides both scale and precision—allowing teams to act before leaked credentials are actively used.\nCredential leaks don't only occur on monitored workstations. According to Cyberint data, 46% of the devices tied to corporate credential leaks were not protected by endpoint monitoring. These include personal laptops or unmanaged devices where employees access business applications, which can serve as blind spots for many teams.\nCyberint's threat detection stack integrates with SIEM and SOAR tools, allowing automated responses like revoking access or forcing password resets the moment a breach is identified. This closes the gap between detection and action—a crucial factor when every hour counts.\nThe full report dives deeper into how these processes work, and how organizations can operationalize this intelligence across teams. You can\nread the full report here\nfor details.\nExposure Detection Is Now a Competitive Advantage\nEven with secure password policies, MFA, and modern email filtering, credential theft remains a statistical likelihood. What differentiates organizations is how fast they detect exposure and how tightly their remediation workflows are aligned.\nTwo playbooks featured in the ebook show how teams can respond effectively, both for employee and third-party vendor credentials. Each outlines procedures for detection, source validation, access revocation, stakeholder communication, and post-incident review.\nBut the key takeaway is this: proactive discovery matters more than reactive forensics. Waiting for threat actors to make the first move extends dwell time and increases the scope of damage.\nThe ability to identify credentials shortly after they appear in underground forums—before they've been packaged up or weaponized in automated campaigns—is what separates successful defense from reactive cleanup.\nIf you're wondering whether your organization has exposed credentials floating in the deep or dark web, you don't need to guess. You can check.\nCheck the Open, Deep and Dark Web for Your Organization's Credentials Now\nMitigation Isn't Just About Prevention\nNo single control can fully eliminate the risk of credential exposure, but multiple layers can reduce the impact:\nStrong Password Policy:\nEnforce regular password changes and prohibit reuse across platforms.\nSSO and MFA:\nAdd barriers beyond the password. Even basic MFA makes credential stuffing far less effective.\nRate Limiting:\nSet thresholds for login attempts to disrupt brute-force and credential spraying tactics.\nPoLP:\nLimit user access to only what's needed, so compromised accounts don't provide broader entry.\nPhishing Awareness Training:\nEducate users about social engineering techniques to reduce initial leaks.\nMonitoring Exposure:\nImplement detection across forums, marketplaces, and paste sites to flag mentions of corporate credentials.\nEach of these controls is helpful, but even together, they aren't enough if exposure goes unnoticed for weeks or months. That's where detection intelligence from Cyberint comes in.\nYou can learn more methods by\nreading the full report.\nBefore the Next Password is Stolen\nIt's not a matter of if an account associated with your domain will be exposed—it's already happened. The real question is: has it been found?\nThousands of credentials tied to active accounts are currently being passed around marketplaces, forums, and Telegram chats. Many belong to users who still have access to corporate resources. Some are bundled with metadata like device type, session cookies, or even VPN credentials. Once shared, this information spreads fast and becomes impossible to retract.\nIdentifying exposures before they're used is one of the few meaningful advantages defenders have. And it starts with knowing where to look.\nThreat intelligence plays a central role in detection and response, especially when it comes to exposed credentials. Given their widespread circulation across criminal networks, credentials require focused monitoring and clear processes for mitigation.\nCheck if your company's credentials are exposed across the open, deep, and dark web.\nThe earlier they're found, the fewer incidents there will be to respond to later.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nGoogle News\n,\nTwitter\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

Cumulatively, the gems have been downloaded more than 275,000 times.\nThat said, it bears noting that the figure may not accurately represent the actual number of compromised systems, as not every download results in execution, and it's possible several of these gems have been downloaded to a single machine.\n\"Since at least March 2023, a threat actor using the aliases zon, nowon, kwonsoonje, and soonje has published 60 malicious gems posing as automation tools for Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, WordPress, Telegram, Kakao, and Naver,\" security researcher Kirill Boychenko\nsaid\n.\nWhile the identified gems offered the promised functionality, such as bulk posting or engagement, they also harbored covert functionality to exfiltrate usernames and passwords to an external server under the threat actor's control by displaying a simple graphical user interface to enter users' credentials.\nSome of the gems, such as njongto_duo and jongmogtolon, are notable for focusing on financial discussion platforms, with the libraries marketed as tools to flood investment-related forums with ticker mentions, stock narratives, and synthetic engagement to amplify visibility and manipulate public perception.\nThe servers that are used to receive the captured information include programzon[.]com, appspace[.]kr, and marketingduo[.]co[.]kr. These domains have been found to advertise bulk messaging, phone number scraping, and automated social media tools.\nVictims of the campaign are likely to be grey-hat marketers who rely on such tools to run spam, search engine optimization (SEO), and engagement campaigns that artificially boost engagement.\n\"Each gem functions as a Windows-targeting infostealer, primarily (but not exclusively) aimed at South Korean users, as evidenced by Korean-language UIs and exfiltration to .kr domains,\" Socket said. \"The campaign evolved across multiple aliases and infrastructure waves, suggesting a mature and persistent operation.\"\n\"By embedding credential theft functionality within gems marketed to automation-focused grey-hat users, the threat actor covertly captures sensitive data while blending into activity that appears legitimate.\"\nThe development comes as GitLab detected multiple typosquatting packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI) that are designed to steal cryptocurrency from Bittensor wallets by hijacking the\nlegitimate staking functions\n.

        "Content": "A newly discovered campaign dubbed\nGreedyBear\nhas leveraged over 150 malicious extensions to the Firefox marketplace that are designed to impersonate popular cryptocurrency wallets and steal more than $1 million in digital assets.\nThe published browser add-ons masquerade as MetaMask, TronLink, Exodus, and Rabby Wallet, among others, Koi Security researcher Tuval Admoni said.\nWhat makes the activity notable is the threat actor's use of a technique that the cybersecurity company called Extension Hollowing to bypass safeguards put in place by Mozilla and exploit user trust. It's worth noting that some aspects of the campaign were\nfirst documented\nby security researcher Lukasz Olejnik last week.\n\"Rather than trying to sneak malicious extensions past initial reviews, they build legitimate-seeming extension portfolios first, then weaponize them later when nobody's watching,\" Admoni\nsaid\nin a report published Thursday.\nTo achieve this, the attackers first create a publisher account in the marketplace, upload innocuous extensions with no actual functionality to sidestep initial reviews, post fake positive reviews to create an illusion of credibility, and modify their innards with malicious capabilities.\nThe fake extensions are designed to capture wallet credentials entered by unsuspecting users and exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled server. It also gathers victims' IP addresses for likely tracking purposes.\nThe campaign is assessed to be an extension of a previous iteration called\nFoxy Wallet\nthat involved the threat actors publishing no less than 40 malicious browser extensions for Mozilla Firefox with similar goals in mind. The latest spike in the number of extensions indicates the growing scale of the operation.\nThe fake wallet cryptocurrency draining attacks are augmented by campaigns that distribute malicious executables through various Russian sites that peddle cracked and pirated software, leading to the deployment of information stealers and even ransomware.\nThe GreedyBear actors have also found setting up scam sites that pose as cryptocurrency products and services, such as wallet repair tools, to possibly trick users into parting with their wallet credentials, or payment details, resulting in credential theft and financial fraud.\nKoi Security said it was able to link the three attack verticals to a single threat actor based on the fact that the domains used in these efforts all point to a lone IP address: 185.208.156[.]66, which acts as a command-and-control (C2) server for data collection and management.\nThere is evidence to suggest that the extension-related attacks are branching out to target other browser marketplaces. This is based on the discovery of a Google Chrome extension named Filecoin Wallet that has used the same C2 server and the underlying logic to pilfer credentials.\nTo make matters worse, an analysis of the artifacts has uncovered signs that they may have been created using artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools. This underscores how threat actors are increasingly misusing AI systems to enable attacks at scale and at speed.\n\"This variety indicates the group is not deploying a single toolset, but rather operating a broad malware distribution pipeline, capable of shifting tactics as needed,\" Admoni said.\n\"The campaign has since evolved the difference now is scale and scope: this has evolved into a multi-platform credential and asset theft campaign, backed by hundreds of malware samples and scam infrastructure.\"\nEthereum Drainers Pose as Trading Bots to Steal Crypto\nThe disclosure comes as SentinelOne flagged a widespread and ongoing cryptocurrency scam that entails distributing a malicious smart contract disguised as a trading bot in order to drain user wallets. The fraudulent Ethereum drainer scheme, active since early 2024, is estimated to have already netted the threat actors more than $900,000 in stolen profits.\n\"The scams are marketed through YouTube videos which explain the purported nature of the crypto trading bot and explain how to deploy a smart contract on the Remix Solidity Compiler platform, a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for Web3 projects,\" researcher Alex Delamotte\nsaid\n. \"The video descriptions share a link to an external site that hosts the weaponized smart contract code.\"\nThe videos are said to be AI-generated and are published from aged accounts that post other sources' cryptocurrency news as playlists in an effort to build legitimacy. The videos also feature overwhelmingly positive comments, suggesting that the threat actors are actively curating the comment sections and removing any negative feedback.\nOne of the YouTube accounts pushing the scam was created in October 2022. This either indicates that the fraudsters slowly and steadily boosted the account's credibility over time or may have purchased it from a service selling such aged YouTube channels off Telegram and dedicated sites like Accs-market and Aged Profiles.\nThe attack moves to the next phase when the victim deploys the smart contract, after which the victims are instructed to send ETH to the new contract, which then causes the funds to be routed to an obfuscated threat actor-controlled wallet.\n\"The combination of AI-generated content and aged YouTube accounts available for sale means that any modestly-resourced actor can obtain a YouTube account that the algorithm deems 'established' and weaponize the account to post customized content under a false pretext of legitimacy,\" Delamotte said.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Americans aged 60 and older lost a staggering $700 million to online scams in 2024, marking a sharp rise in fraud targeting seniors, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\nThis figure, presented in the agency's latest\nConsumer Protection Data Spotlight\n, represents an increase over all three categories of loss compared to previous years.\nMost notably, the amount of losses for those who lost over $100k recorded an eightfold jump compared to 2020.\nBelow is an analysis of the amounts:\nLosses above $100k: $445 million\nLosses between $10 and $100k: $214 million\nLosses under $10k: $41 million\nIn 2020, the total losses were $121M, so the 2024 figure of $700M represents a sixfold increase.\nCompared to the previous year, 2023, where $542M in losses for people over 60 years of age were logged, 2024 represented a notable increase of about 30%.\nAnnual losses to scams from 60+ year olds\nSource: FTC\nPrevalent scam tactics\nThe FTC\nhighlighted\ncommon scam tactics targeting older adults in 2024, involving impersonation, fake crisis scenarios, and phone calls.\nThe victims were told lies crafted to create urgency, like suspicious activity on their banking accounts, their Social Security numbers involved in crimes, or malware infection and hacks of their computers.\nScammers posed as government agencies, including the FTC, or businesses like Microsoft and Amazon, offering to help targets with an alleged issue.\n\"In another layer of irony, these scammers often pretend to be the FTC, the nation's consumer protection agency, sometimes impersonating real staff,\" reports the FTC.\n\"Reports show these scammers have told people to transfer money out of their accounts, deposit cash into Bitcoin ATMs, and even hand off stacks of cash or gold to couriers – all things the real FTC will never do.\"\nThe FTC noted that most of these scams start online, but are often also followed by phone calls made to intensify pressure and emotionally manipulate the victims while they're in a vulnerable, isolated state.\nOlder adults often become targets of scammers due to their access to larger financial reserves, trust or respect for authorities, and poor understanding of technology.\nThe FTC says that in many cases, those people lose their entire life savings and even 401(k)s, leaving them financially and emotionally devastated.\nTo stay safe from these scams, the agency recommends never moving money or sharing financial information with unknown callers or messengers. Instead, people should hang up and verify by contacting the agency or company directly, using publicly available contact information.\nWhile the $445 million lost in 2024 by people over the age of 60 is no doubt a significant amount, it pales in comparison to the total amount Americans lost to fraud in 2024, which, according to the FTC,\nwas $12.5 billion\n.\nThis was a record amount, constituting a 25% increase over 2023, reflecting a continuous rise in losses to scams ever since the FTC started logging this data.\nRed Report 2025: Analyzing the Top ATT&CK Techniques Used by 93% of Malware\nMalware targeting password stores surged 3X as attackers executed stealthy Perfect Heist scenarios, infiltrating and exploiting critical systems.\nDiscover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nHacker extradited to US for stealing $3.3 million from taxpayers\nPolice dismantles investment fraud ring stealing €10 million\nEuropol helps disrupt $540 million crypto investment fraud ring\nFive plead guilty to laundering $36 million stolen in investment scams\nUS arrests suspects behind $73M ‘pig butchering’ laundering scheme"

Currently, the app has been downloaded 50 million times on the\nGoogle Play Store\n(with over 952,000 reviews with an average of 4.9/5 rating) and received nearly 136,000 ratings on\nApple's App Store\n.\nAccording to Microsoft's timeline, the retirement process will begin in mid-September, with new Apple App Store and Google Play Store installs to be disabled one month later.\nStarting in mid-November, Microsoft Lens will be removed from app stores. Users who still have it installed will no longer be able to create new scans after mid-December 2025.\n\"This change affects users of the Microsoft Lens mobile app on iOS and Android. After December 15, 2025, users will no longer be able to create new scans in the app,\"\nRedmond said\nin a Thursday message center note.\n\"Existing scans will remain accessible in the app's MyScans folder, but this functionality will no longer be supported. Users can continue scanning using the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, which offers similar functionality. Scans saved to OneDrive will be accessible via the MyCreations section in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app.\"\nThe company advised Microsoft Lens users to switch to the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, which supports most of its features but does not allow them to save scans directly to OneNote, Word, or PowerPoint, or scan business cards to save them to OneNote.\nAdditionally, the Microsoft 365 Copilot app doesn't provide read-out-loud functionality or Immersive Reader integration. However, the company pledged to continue adding new features and improving its current capabilities.\nMicrosoft Lens is one of several apps and services that Redmond announced will be killed since the start of the year.\nFor instance, in May, Microsoft\nnotified Microsoft Authenticator users\nthat the app's password autofill feature would be deprecated in July and advised users to switch to Microsoft Edge instead, after\ngiving them until August 1st\nto export their passwords before they became unavailable in the app.\nTwo months earlier, the company published\nguidance for Microsoft Publisher users\n, alerting them that the desktop publishing application would no longer be supported and would be removed from Microsoft 365 after October 2026.\nOne year ago, Microsoft\nalso said\nthat the Windows Paint 3D graphics app would be discontinued and removed from the Microsoft Store in November 2024.\nRed Report 2025: Analyzing the Top ATT&CK Techniques Used by 93% of Malware\nMalware targeting password stores surged 3X as attackers executed stealthy Perfect Heist scenarios, infiltrating and exploiting critical systems.\nDiscover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nEdit, compress, and convert PDFs without monthly fees in this deal\nFree Autoswagger Tool Finds the API Flaws Attackers Hope You Miss\nDitch subscriptions: Get SwifDoo PDF Pro for life at just $30 in this deal\nThis Adobe PDF competitor doesn’t require a subscription in this deal\nMicrosoft fixes ‘Print to PDF’ feature broken by Windows update"

        "Content": "A new documentary series about cybercrime airing next month on HBO Max features interviews with Yours Truly. The four-part series follows the exploits of Julius Kivimäki, a prolific Finnish hacker recently convicted of leaking tens of thousands of patient records from an online psychotherapy practice while attempting to extort the clinic and its patients.\nThe documentary, “Most Wanted: Teen Hacker,” explores the 27-year-old Kivimäki’s lengthy and increasingly destructive career, one that was marked by cyber attacks designed to result in real-world physical impacts on their targets.\nBy the age of 14, Kivimäki had fallen in with a group of criminal hackers who were mass-compromising websites and milking them for customer payment card data. Kivimäki and his friends enjoyed harassing and terrorizing others by “swatting” their homes — calling in fake hostage situations or bomb threats at a target’s address in the hopes of triggering a heavily-armed police response to that location.\nOn Dec. 26, 2014, Kivimäki and fellow members of a group of online hooligans calling themselves the Lizard Squad launched a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox Live platforms, preventing millions of users from playing with their shiny new gaming rigs the day after Christmas. The Lizard Squad later acknowledged that the stunt was planned to call attention to their new DDoS-for-hire service, which came online and started selling subscriptions shortly after the attack.\nFinnish investigators said Kivimäki also was responsible for a 2014 bomb threat against former Sony Online Entertainment President John Smedley that grounded an American Airlines plane. That incident was widely reported to have started with a Twitter post from the Lizard Squad, after Smedley mentioned some upcoming travel plans online. But according to Smedley and Finnish investigators, the bomb threat started with a phone call from Kivimäki.\nJulius “Zeekill” Kivimaki, in December 2014.\nThe creaky wheels of justice seemed to be catching up with Kivimäki in mid-2015, when a Finnish court found him guilty of more than 50,000 cybercrimes, including data breaches, payment fraud, and operating a global botnet of hacked computers. Unfortunately, the defendant was 17 at the time, and received little more than a slap on the wrist: A two-year suspended sentence and a small fine.\nKivimäki immediately bragged online about the lenient sentencing, posting on Twitter that he was an “untouchable hacker god.” I wrote a column in 2015 lamenting his laughable punishment because it was clear even then that this was a person who enjoyed watching other people suffer, and who seemed utterly incapable of remorse about any of it. It was also abundantly clear to everyone who investigated his crimes that he wasn’t going to quit unless someone made him stop.\nIn response to some of my early reporting that mentioned Kivimäki, one reader shared that they had been dealing with non-stop harassment and abuse from Kivimäki for years, including swatting incidents, unwanted deliveries and subscriptions, emails to her friends and co-workers, as well as threatening phonecalls and texts at all hours of the night. The reader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, shared that Kivimäki at one point confided that he had no reason whatsoever for harassing her — that she was picked at random and that it was just something he did for laughs.\nFive years after Kivimäki’s conviction, the Vastaamo Psychotherapy Center in Finland became the target of blackmail when a tormentor identified as “ransom_man” demanded payment of 40 bitcoins (~450,000 euros at the time) in return for a promise not to publish highly sensitive therapy session notes Vastaamo had exposed online.\nRansom_man, a.k.a. Kivimäki, announced on the dark web that he would start publishing 100 patient profiles every 24 hours. When Vastaamo declined to pay, ransom_man shifted to extorting individual patients. According to Finnish police, some 22,000 victims reported extortion attempts targeting them personally, targeted emails that threatened to publish their therapy notes online unless paid a 500 euro ransom.\nIn October 2022, Finnish authorities charged Kivimäki with extorting Vastaamo and its patients. But by that time he was on the run from the law and living it up across Europe, spending lavishly on fancy cars, apartments and a hard-partying lifestyle.\nIn February 2023, Kivimäki was arrested in France after authorities there responded to a domestic disturbance call and found the defendant sleeping off a hangover on the couch of a woman he’d met the night before. The French police grew suspicious when the 6′ 3″ blonde, green-eyed man presented an ID that stated he was of Romanian nationality.\nA redacted copy of an ID Kivimaki gave to French authorities claiming he was from Romania.\nIn April 2024, Kivimäki was sentenced to more than six years in prison after being convicted of extorting Vastaamo and its patients.\nThe documentary is directed by the award-winning Finnish producer and director Sami Kieski and co-written by Joni Soila. According to an August 6 press release, the four 43-minute episodes will drop weekly on Fridays throughout September across Europe, the U.S, Latin America, Australia and South-East Asia.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Friday 8th of August 2025 05:38 PM \r\n         \nCongratulations on the HBO show.
