        "Content": "Popular password manager plugins for web browsers have been found susceptible to clickjacking security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to steal account credentials, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, and credit card details under certain conditions.\nThe technique has been dubbed Document Object Model (\nDOM\n)-based extension clickjacking by independent security researcher Marek T√≥th, who\npresented the findings\nat the DEF CON 33 security conference earlier this month.\n\"A single click anywhere on an attacker-controlled website could allow attackers to steal users' data (credit card details, personal data, login credentials, including TOTP),\" T√≥th\nsaid\n. \"The new technique is general and can be applied to other types of extensions.\"\nClickjacking\n, also called UI redressing, refers to a type of attack in which users are tricked into performing a series of actions on a website that appear ostensibly harmless, such as clicking on buttons, when, in reality, they are inadvertently carrying out the attacker's bidding.\nThe new technique detailed by T√≥th essentially involves using a malicious script to manipulate UI elements in a web page that browser extensions inject into the DOM -- for example, auto-fill prompts, by making them invisible by setting their opacity to zero.\nThe research specifically focused on 11 popular password manager browser add-ons, ranging from 1Password to iCloud Passwords, all of which have been found to be susceptible to DOM-based extension clickjacking. Collectively, these extensions have millions of users.\nTo pull off the attack, all a bad actor has to do is create a fake site with an intrusive pop-up, such as a login screen or a cookie consent banner, while embedding an invisible login form such that clicking on the site to close the pop-up causes the credential information to be auto-filled by the password manager and exfiltrated to a remote server.\n\"All password managers filled credentials not only to the 'main' domain, but also to all subdomains,\" T√≥th explained. \"An attacker could easily find XSS or other vulnerabilities and steal the user's stored credentials with a single click (10 out of 11), including TOTP (9 out of 11). In some scenarios, passkey authentication could also be exploited (8 out of 11).\"\nFollowing responsible disclosure, six of the vendors have yet to release fixes for the defect -\n1Password Password Manager 8.11.4.27\nApple iCloud Passwords 3.1.25\nBitwarden Password Manager 2025.7.0\nEnpass 6.11.6\nLastPass 4.146.3\nLogMeOnce 7.12.4\nSoftware supply chain security firm Socket, which independently reviewed the research,\nsaid\nBitwarden, Enpass, and iCloud Passwords are actively working on fixes, while 1Password and LastPass marked them as informative. It has also reached out to US-CERT to assign CVE identifiers for the identified issues.\nUntil fixes are available, it's advised that users disable the auto-fill function in their password managers and only use copy/paste.\n\"For Chromium-based browser users, it is recommended to configure site access to 'on click' in extension settings,\" T√≥th said. \"This configuration allows users to manually control auto-fill functionality.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage group known as\nStatic Tundra\nhas been observed actively exploiting a seven-year-old security flaw in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE software as a means to establish persistent access to target networks.\nCisco Talos, which\ndisclosed\ndetails of the activity, said the attacks single out organizations in telecommunications, higher education and manufacturing sectors across North America, Asia, Africa and Europe. Prospective victims are chosen based on their \"strategic interest\" to Russia, it added, with recent efforts directed against Ukraine and its allies following the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war in 2022.\nThe\nvulnerability\nin question is\nCVE-2018-0171\n(CVSS score: 9.8), a critical flaw in the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code.\nIt's worth noting that the security defect has also been\nlikely weaponized\nby the China-aligned Salt Typhoon (aka Operator Panda) actors as part of attacks targeting U.S. telecommunication providers in late 2024.\nStatic Tundra, per Talos, is assessed to be linked to the Federal Security Service's (FSB) Center 16 unit and operational for over a decade, with a focus on long-term intelligence gathering operations. It's believed to be a\nsub-cluster\nof\nanother group\nthat's tracked as Berserk Bear, Crouching Yeti, Dragonfly, Energetic Bear, and Havex.\nThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in a\nconcurrent advisory\n, said it has observed\nFSB cyber actors\n\"exploiting Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and end-of-life networking devices running an unpatched vulnerability (CVE-2018-0171) in Cisco Smart Install (SMI) to broadly target entities in the United States and globally.\"\nIn these attacks, the threat actors have been found collecting configuration files for thousands of networking devices associated with U.S. entities across critical infrastructure sectors. The activity is also characterized by the attackers modifying configuration files on susceptible devices to facilitate unauthorized access.\nThe foothold is then abused to conduct reconnaissance within the victim networks, while simultaneously deploying custom tools like\nSYNful Knock\n, a router implant first reported by Mandiant in September 2015.\n\"SYNful Knock is a stealthy modification of the router's firmware image that can be used to maintain persistence within a victim's network,\" the threat intelligence firm\nsaid\nat the time. \"It is customizable and modular in nature and thus can be updated once implanted.\"\nAnother noteworthy aspect of the attacks concerns the use of SNMP to send instructions to download a text file from a remote server and append it to the current running configuration so as to allow for additional means of access to the network devices. Defense evasion is achieved by modifying\nTACACS+ configuration\non infected appliances to interfere with remote logging functions.\n\"Static Tundra likely uses publicly-available scan data from services such as Shodan or Censys to identify systems of interest,\" Talos researchers Sara McBroom and Brandon White said. \"One of Static Tundra's primary actions on objectives is to capture network traffic that would be of value from an intelligence perspective.\"\nThis is accomplished by setting up Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels that redirect traffic of interest to attacker-controlled infrastructure. The adversary has also been spotted collecting and exfiltrating NetFlow data on compromised systems. The harvested data is exfiltrated via outbound TFTP or FTP connections.\nStatic Tundra's activities are primarily focused on unpatched, and often end-of-life, network devices with the goal of establishing access on primary targets and facilitating secondary operations against related targets of interest. Upon gaining initial access, the threat actors burrow deeper into the environment and hack into additional network devices for long-term access and information gathering.\nTo mitigate the risk posed by the threat, Cisco is advising customers to apply the patch for CVE-2018-0171 or disable Smart Install if patching is not an option.\n\"The purpose of this campaign is to compromise and extract device configuration information en masse, which can later be leveraged as needed based on then-current strategic goals and interests of the Russian government,\" Talos said. \"This is demonstrated by Static Tundra's adaptation and shifts in operational focus as Russia's priorities have changed over time.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have demonstrated a new prompt injection technique called\nPromptFix\nthat tricks a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) model into carrying out intended actions by embedding the malicious instruction inside a fake CAPTCHA check on a web page.\nDescribed by Guardio Labs an \"AI-era take on the\nClickFix\nscam,\" the attack technique demonstrates how AI-driven browsers, such as Perplexity's\nComet\n, that promise to automate mundane tasks like shopping for items online or handling emails on behalf of users can be deceived into interacting with phishing landing pages or fraudulent lookalike storefronts without the human user's knowledge or intervention.\n\"With PromptFix, the approach is different: We don't try to glitch the model into obedience,\" Guardio researchers Nati Tal and Shaked Chen\nsaid\n. \"Instead, we mislead it using techniques borrowed from the human social engineering playbook ‚Äì appealing directly to its core design goal: to help its human quickly, completely, and without hesitation.\"\nThis leads to a new reality that the company calls\nScamlexity\n, a portmanteau of the terms \"scam\" and \"complexity,\" where agentic AI ‚Äì systems that can autonomously pursue goals, make decisions, and take actions with minimal human supervision ‚Äì takes scams to a whole new level.\nWith AI-powered coding assistants like Lovable proven to be susceptible to techniques like\nVibeScamming\n, an attacker can effectively trick the AI model into handing over sensitive information or carrying out purchases on lookalike websites masquerading as Walmart.\nAll of this can be accomplished by issuing an instruction as simple as \"Buy me an Apple Watch\" after the human lands on the bogus website in question through one of the several methods, like social media ads, spam messages, or search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning.\nScamlexity is \"a complex new era of scams, where AI convenience collides with a new, invisible scam surface and humans become the collateral damage,\" Guardio said.\nThe cybersecurity company said it ran the test several times on Comet, with the browser only stopping occasionally and asking the human user to complete the checkout process manually. But in several instances, the browser went all in, adding the product to the cart and auto-filling the user's saved address and credit card details without asking for their confirmation on a fake shopping site.\nIn a similar vein, it has been found that asking Comet to check their email messages for any action items is enough to parse spam emails purporting to be from their bank, automatically click on an embedded link in the message, and enter the login credentials on the phony login page.\n\"The result: a perfect trust chain gone rogue. By handling the entire interaction from email to website, Comet effectively vouched for the phishing page,\" Guardio said. \"The human never saw the suspicious sender address, never hovered over the link, and never had the chance to question the domain.\"\nThat's not all. As prompt injections continue to plague AI systems in ways direct and indirect, AI Browsers will also have to deal with hidden prompts concealed within a web page that's invisible to the human user, but can be parsed by the AI model to trigger unintended actions.\nThis so-called PromptFix attack is designed to convince the AI model to click on invisible buttons in a web page to bypass CAPTCHA checks and download malicious payloads without any involvement on the part of the human user, resulting in a drive-by download attack.\n\"PromptFix works only on Comet (which truly functions as an AI Agent) and, for that matter, also on ChatGPT's\nAgent Mode\n, where we successfully got it to click the button or carry out actions as instructed,\" Guardio told The Hacker News. \"The difference is that in ChatGPT's case, the downloaded file lands inside its virtual environment, not directly on your computer, since everything still runs in a sandboxed setup.\"\nThe findings show the need for AI systems to go beyond reactive defenses to anticipate, detect, and neutralize these attacks by building robust guardrails for phishing detection, URL reputation checks, domain spoofing, and malicious files.\nThe development also comes as adversaries are increasingly leaning on GenAI platforms like website builders and writing assistants to craft realistic phishing content, clone trusted brands, and automate large-scale deployment using services like low-code site builders, per\nPalo Alto Networks Unit 42\n.\nWhat's more, AI coding assistants can inadvertently expose proprietary code or sensitive intellectual property, creating potential entry points for targeted attacks, the company added.\nEnterprise security firm Proofpoint\nsaid\nit has observed \"numerous campaigns leveraging Lovable services to distribute multi-factor authentication (MFA) phishing kits like\nTycoon\n, malware such as cryptocurrency wallet drainers or malware loaders, and phishing kits targeting credit card and personal information.\"\nThe counterfeit websites created using Lovable lead to CAPTCHA checks that, when solved, redirect to a Microsoft-branded credential phishing page. Other websites have been found to impersonate shipping and logistics services like UPS to dupe victims into entering their personal and financial information, or lead them to pages that download remote access trojans like\nzgRAT\n.\nLovable URLs have also been abused for investment scams and banking credential phishing, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for cybercrime. Lovable has since taken down the sites and implemented AI-driven security protections to prevent the creation of malicious websites.\nOther campaigns have capitalized on\ndeceptive deepfaked content\ndistributed on YouTube and social media platforms to redirect users to fraudulent investment sites. These AI trading scams also rely on fake blogs and review sites, often hosted on platforms like Medium, Blogger, and Pinterest, to create a false sense of legitimacy.\nOnce users land on these bogus platforms, they are asked to sign up for a trading account and instructed via email by their \"account manager\" to make a small initial deposit anywhere between $100 and $250 in order to supposedly activate the accounts. The trading platform also urges them to provide proof of identity for verification and enter their cryptocurrency wallet, credit card, or internet banking details as payment methods.\nThese campaigns, per Group-IB, have targeted users in several countries, including India, the U.K., Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Mexico, Canada, Australia, the Czech Republic, Argentina, Japan, and Turkey. However, the fraudulent platforms are inaccessible from IP addresses originating in the U.S. and Israel.\n\"GenAI enhances threat actors' operations rather than replacing existing attack methodologies,\" CrowdStrike\nsaid\nin its Threat Hunting Report for 2025. \"Threat actors of all motivations and skill levels will almost certainly increase their use of GenAI tools for social engineering in the near-to mid-term, particularly as these tools become more available, user-friendly, and sophisticated.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Modern businesses face a rapidly evolving and expanding threat landscape, but what does this mean for your business? It means a growing number of risks, along with an increase in their frequency, variety, complexity, severity, and potential business impact.\nThe real question is, \"How do you tackle these rising threats?\" The answer lies in having a robust BCDR strategy. However, to build a rock-solid BCDR plan, you must first conduct a business impact analysis (BIA). Read on to learn what BIA is and how it forms the foundation of an effective BCDR strategy.\nWhat Is a BIA?\nA BIA is a structured approach to identifying and evaluating the operational impact of disruptions across departments. Disruptive incidents or emergencies can occur due to several factors, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters or supply chain issues.\nConducting a BIA helps identify critical functions for a business's operations and survival. Businesses can use insights from BIA to develop strategies to resume those functions first to maintain core services in the event of a crisis.\nIt informs key priorities, such as\nRTO/RPO\nSLAs, and aligns technological capabilities proportionally with the level of threat and risk, which are critical for continuity and recovery planning.\nThe IT Leader's Role in Enabling an Effective BIA\nWhile business continuity, risk, or compliance teams often lead business impact analysis, IT leaders play a crucial role in making it work. They bring critical visibility into system dependencies and infrastructure across the organization. They provide valuable insights into what's technically feasible when disaster strikes. IT leaders also play a key part in validating recovery commitments, whether the set RTO and RPO goals can be achieved within the current infrastructure, or if upgrades are needed.\nIT leaders operationalize the recovery strategy with appropriate tooling, from selecting and configuring DR tools to automating failover processes. This helps ensure the recovery plan is executable, integrated into everyday operations, tested and ready to scale with the business.\nIn SMBs or IT-led orgs, IT often leads the BIA by necessity. Because of their cross-functional view of operations, infrastructure and business continuity, IT leaders are uniquely positioned to drive the BIA.\nPro Tip:\nIT's involvement ensures the BIA isn't just a business document; it becomes an actionable recovery plan.\nIdentifying Threat Vectors\nBefore you can protect what matters, you must understand what threatens it. Assess the threat landscape facing your organization and tailor your response plan based on industry, geographic risk and operational profile.\nHere are the key threat vectors to consider:\nCyberthreats:\nFrom ransomware to insider threats and credential compromise, cyberattacks are growing in complexity, frequency and severity. One weak point in your defense systems can lead to massive data loss and operational downtime.\nNatural Disasters:\nEvents like hurricanes, wildfires, floods and earthquakes strike fast and hard. The effects of these events can ripple across regions, disrupting supply chains, data centers and physical offices.\nOperational Disruptions:\nUnexpected outages due to power failure, software bugs or network downtime can bring daily operations to a grinding halt if you aren't prepared.\nHuman Error:\nAnyone, including your best employees, can make mistakes. Accidental deletions or misconfigurations can lead to costly downtime.\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks:\nData breaches and data loss can not only hurt your business financially but also lead to legal issues and compliance violations.\nFig 1: Impact analysis of different threats\nIndustry-specific risks\nEvery sector operates in its own unique way and relies on different systems to stay up and running. Certain threats can hinder those systems and core functions more than others. Here are a few examples to guide you in identifying and prioritizing threats based on industry.\nHealthcare\nIf you operate in the healthcare sector, ransomware and system availability must be your top priorities since any disruption or downtime can directly impact patient care and safety. As regulations like HIPAA get more stringent, data protection and privacy become critical to meet compliance requirements.\nEducation\nPhishing and account compromise attacks targeting staff and students are common in the education sector. Additionally, the rise of hybrid learning environments has expanded the threat surface, stretching across student endpoints, SaaS platforms and on-premises servers. To make matters more challenging, many institutions operate with limited IT staff and resources, making them more vulnerable to human error, slower threat detection and delayed response times.\nManufacturing and Logistics\nIn manufacturing and logistics, operational technology (OT) uptime is mission-critical as downtime caused by power failures, network outages or system disruptions can halt production lines and delay deliveries. Unlike traditional IT environments, many OT systems aren't easily backed up or virtualized, requiring specific DR considerations. Moreover, any disruption to just-in-time (JIT) supply chains can delay inventory, increase costs and jeopardize vendor relationships.\nAs you build your BIA threat matrix, score each threat by likelihood and impact:\nWhat's the chance this will occur in the next one to three years?\nIf it happens, what systems, people and business functions will it affect?\nCan this threat create a cascading failure?\nPrioritization helps you focus recovery resources where the risk is highest and the cost of downtime is greatest.\nRunning the BIA\nFollow these steps to conduct a BIA to strengthen your recovery strategy:\n1. Identify and List Critical Business Functions\nKnowing what matters most for your business's survival is critical for designing effective BCDR plans that align with your business requirements.\nWork with department heads to identify critical business functions and associate them with the IT assets, apps and services that support them.\n2. Assess the Impact of Downtime\nDowntime, depending on the duration, can severely or mildly impact business operations.\nIt's important to evaluate the consequences across revenue, compliance, productivity and reputation.\nCategorize business functions by impact severity (e.g., high, medium, low).\n3. Define RTOs and RPOs\nRTOs and RPOs are critical benchmarks that define how quickly your systems must be restored and how much data loss your organization can endure.\nWork with business and technical teams to establish:\nRTO: Maximum acceptable downtime.\nRPO: Maximum acceptable data loss.\n4. Prioritize Systems and Data\nWhen the unexpected occurs, being able to recover quickly can help maintain business continuity and minimize downtime risks.\nCreate a backup and recovery plan by linking impact tiers with IT assets and applications they rely on.\n5. Document Dependencies\nDocumenting dependencies between business functions and IT systems is important to understand the critical links between them, ensure accurate impact assessments and drive effective recovery planning.\nInclude infrastructure, SaaS tools, third-party integrations and interdependent apps.\nTurn Insights Into Action With Datto BCDR\nA well-executed BIA lays the foundation for a resilient, recovery-ready organization. It provides the essential data to make risk-based, cost-effective decisions. While BIA offers valuable insights into recovery objectives, dependencies and risks, Datto turns those insights into automated, repeatable recovery actions.\nDatto provides a unified platform for backup, disaster recovery, ransomware detection, business continuity and disaster recovery orchestration.

        "Content": "North Korean threat actors have been attributed to a coordinated cyber espionage campaign targeting diplomatic missions in their southern counterpart between March and July 2025.\nThe activity manifested in the form of at least 19 spear-phishing emails that impersonated trusted diplomatic contacts with the goal of luring embassy staff and foreign ministry personnel with convincing meeting invites, official letters, and event invitations.\n\"The attackers leveraged GitHub, typically known as a legitimate developer platform, as a covert command-and-control channel,\" Trellix researchers Pham Duy Phuc and Alex Lanstein\nsaid\n.\nThe infection chains have been observed to rely on trusted cloud storage solutions like Dropbox and Daum Cloud, an online service from South Korean internet conglomerate Kakao Corporation, in order to deliver a variant of an open-source remote access trojan called Xeno RAT that grants the threat actors to take control of compromised systems.\nThe campaign is assessed to be the work of a North Korean hacking group called Kimsuky, which was\nrecently linked\nto phishing attacks that employ GitHub as a stager for an Xeno RAT known as MoonPeak. Despite the infrastructure and tactical overlaps, there are indications that the phishing attacks match China-based operatives.\nThe email messages, per Trellix, are carefully crafted to appear legitimate, often spoofing real diplomats or officials so as to entice recipients into opening password-protected malicious ZIP files hosted on Dropbox, Google Drive, or Daum. The messages are written in Korean, English, Persian, Arabic, French, and Russian.\n\"The spear-phishing content was carefully crafted to mimic legitimate diplomatic correspondence,\" Trellix said. \"Many emails included official signature, diplomatic terminology, and references to real events (e.g., summits, forums, or meetings).\"\n\"The attackers impersonated trusted entities (embassies, ministries, international organizations), a long-running Kimsuky tactic. By strategically timing lures alongside real diplomatic happenings, they enhanced the credibility.\"\nPresent within the ZIP archive is a Windows shortcut (LNK) masquerading as a PDF document, launching which results in the execution of PowerShell code that, in turn, runs an embedded payload, which reaches out to GitHub for fetching next-stage malware and establishes persistence through scheduled tasks. In parallel, a decoy document is displayed to the victims.\nThe script is also designed to harvest system information and exfiltrate the details to an attacker-controlled private GitHub repository, while simultaneously retrieving additional payloads by parsing the contents of a text file (\"onf.txt\") in the repository to extract the Dropbox URL hosting the MoonPeak trojan.\n\"By simply updating onf.txt in the repository (pointing to a new Dropbox file), the operators could rotate payloads to infected machines,\" Trellix explained.\n\"They also practiced 'rapid' infrastructure rotation: log data suggests that the ofx.txt payload was updated multiple times in an hour to deploy malware and to remove traces after use. This rapid update cycle, combined with the use of cloud infrastructure, helped the malicious activities fly under the radar.\"\nInterestingly, the cybersecurity company's time-based analysis of the attackers' activity has found it to be largely originating from a timezone that's consistent with China, with a smaller proportion aligning with that of the Koreas. To add to the intrigue, a \"perfect 3-day pause\" was observed coinciding with Chinese national holidays in early April 2025, but not during North or South Korean holidays.\nThis has raised the possibility that the campaign, mirroring Chinese operational cadence while operating with motives that align with North Korea, is likely the result of -\nNorth Korean operatives working from Chinese territory\nA Chinese APT operation mimicking Kimsuky techniques, or\nA collaborative effort leveraging Chinese resources for North Korean intelligence gathering efforts\nWith North Korean cyber actors\nfrequently stationed\nin\nChina and Russia\n, as observed in the case of the\nremote information technology (IT) worker fraud scheme\n, Trellix said with medium-confidence that the operators are operating from China or are culturally Chinese.\n\"The use of Korean services and infrastructure was likely intentional to blend into the South Korean network,\" Trellix said. \"It's a known Kimsuky trait to operate out of Chinese and Russian IP space while targeting South Korea, often using Korean services to mask their traffic as legitimate.\"\nN. Korea IT Worker Scheme Infiltrates 100s of Companies\nThe disclosure comes as CrowdStrike revealed that it has identified more than 320 incidents over the past 12 months where North Koreans posing as remote IT workers have infiltrated companies to\ngenerate illicit revenue\nfor the regime, a 220% jump from last year.\nThe\nIT worker scheme\n, tracked as\nFamous Chollima\nand\nJasper Sleet\n, is believed to use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like Microsoft Copilot or VSCodium and translation tools to help assist with their daily tasks and respond to instant messages and emails. They are also likely to work three or four jobs simultaneously.\nA crucial component of these operations encompasses recruiting people to run laptop farms, which include racks of corporate laptops used by the North Koreans to remotely do their work using tools like AnyDesk as if they were physically located in the country where the companies are based.\n\"Famous Chollima IT workers use GenAI to create attractive r√©sum√©s for companies, reportedly use real-time deepfake technology to mask their true identities in video interviews, and leverage AI code tools to assist in their job duties, all of which pose a substantial challenge to traditional security defenses,\" the company\nsaid\n.\nFamous Chollima's use of GenAI in insider threat operations | Image Source: CrowdStrike\nWhat's more, a leak of 1,389 email addresses linked to the IT workers has uncovered that 29 of the 63 unique email service providers are online tools that allow users to create temporary or disposable email addresses, while another six are related to privacy-focused services like Skiff, Proton Mail, and SimpleLogin. Nearly 89% of the email addresses are Gmail accounts.\n\"All the Gmail accounts are guarded using Google Authenticator, 2FA, and Recovery BackUp Email,\" security researcher Rakesh Krishnan\nsaid\n. \"Many usernames include terms like developer, code, coder, tech, software, indicating a tech or programming focus.\"\nSome of these email addresses are present in a user database leak of the AI photo editing tool Cutout.Pro, suggesting potential use of the software to alter images for social media profiles or identification documents.\nFound this article interesting?

The botnet has been used to carry out large-scale DDoS-for-hire attacks targeting victims in over 80 countries since at least 2021.\nFoltz has been charged with one count of aiding and abetting computer intrusions. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. In addition, law enforcement authorities conducted a search of Foltz's residence on August 6, 2025, seizing administrative control of the botnet infrastructure.\n\"RapperBot, aka 'Eleven Eleven Botnet' and 'CowBot,' is a Botnet that primarily compromises devices like Digital Video Recorders (DVRS) or Wi-Fi routers at scale by infecting those devices with specialized malware,\" the DoJ\nsaid\n.\n\"Clients of RapperBot then issue commands to those infected victim devices, forcing them to send large volumes of 'distributed denial-of-service' (DDoS) traffic to different victim computers and servers located throughout the world.\"\nHeavily inspired by\nfBot\n(aka Satori) and\nMirai\nbotnets, RapperBot is\nknown\nfor its ability to break into target devices using SSH or Telnet brute-force attacks and co-opt them into a malicious network capable of launching DDoS attacks. It was first publicly documented by Fortinet in August 2022, with early campaigns\nobserved\nas far back as May 2021.\nA 2023 report from Fortinet detailed the DDoS botnet's expansion into cryptojacking, profiting off the compromised devices' compute resources to illicitly mine Monero and maximize value. Earlier this year, RapperBot was also implicated in DDoS attacks targeting\nDeepSeek\nand\nX\n.\nFoltz and his co-conspirators have been accused of monetizing RapperBot by providing paying customers access to a powerful DDoS botnet that has been used to conduct over 370,000 attacks, targeting 18,000 unique victims across China, Japan, the United States, Ireland, and Hong Kong from April 2025 to early August.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), one of the many companies that supported the initiative,\nsaid\nRapperBot infected more than 45,000 devices across 39 countries and that it helped identify RapperBot's command-and-control (C2) infrastructure and reverse engineer the IoT malware to map its operations and activities.\nProsecutors also allege that the botnet comprised roughly 65,000 to 95,000 infected victim devices to pull off DDoS attacks that measured between two and three Terabits per second (Tbps), with the largest attack likely exceeding 6 Tbps. Furthermore, the botnet is believed to have been used to carry out\nransom DDoS attacks\naiming to extort victims.\nThe investigation traced the botnet to Foltz after uncovering IP address links to various online services used by the defendant, including PayPal, Gmail, and the internet service provider. Foltz is also said to have searched on Google for references to \"RapperBot\" or \"Rapper Bot\" over 100 times.\nThe disruption of RapperBot is part of\nOperation PowerOFF\n, an ongoing international effort that's designed to dismantle criminal DDoS-for-hire infrastructures worldwide.\nFound this article interesting?

Researchers at cybersecurity company¬†Socket later\nverified the findings\nand helped inform impacted vendors and coordinate public disclosure.\nThe researcher tested his attack on certain versions of¬†1Password,¬†Bitwarden,¬†Enpass,¬†iCloud Passwords,¬†LastPass, and LogMeOnce, and found that¬†all their browser-based variants could leak sensitive info under certain scenarios.\nExploitation methods\nThe main attack mechanic is to run a script on a malicious or compromised website that uses opacity settings,¬†overlays, or pointer-event tricks to hide the autofill dropdown menu of a browser-based password manager.\nManipulating the password manager's element opacity\nSource:¬†Marek T√≥th\nThe attacker then overlays fake intrusive elements (e.g. cookie banners, popups, or CAPTCHA) so that the user‚Äôs clicks fall on the hidden password manager controls, resulting in completing the forms with sensitive information.\nT√≥th demonstrated multiple DOM-based subtypes that constitute exploitation variants of the same flaw, including direct DOM element opacity manipulation, root element opacity manipulation, parent element opacity manipulation, and partial or full overlaying.\nThe researcher also demonstrated the possibility of using a method where the UI follows the mouse cursor, so any user click, no matter where it‚Äôs positioned, triggers data autofill.\nExposure of sensitive data\nSource:¬†Marek T√≥th\nT√≥th says that a universal attack script can be used to identify¬†the password manager active on the target‚Äôs browser and then adapt¬†the attack in real-time.\nVendor impact and responses\nThe researcher tested 11 password managers chosen for their popularity and found that all of them were vulnerable to at least one attack method.\nVulnerability to the attack methods\nSource:¬†Marek T√≥th\nThe researcher notified¬†all vendors notified of the issues in April 2025. The researcher also alerted them that public disclosure would follow in August at DEF CON 33.\nSocket performed another round of contacts this week to notify them that theyr are filing CVEs for their respective products.\n1Password rejected the report, categorizing it as ‚Äúout-of-scope/informative,‚Äù arguing that clickjacking is a general web risk users should mitigate.\nSimilarly, LastPass marked the report as ‚Äúinformative,‚Äù while Bitwarden acknowledged the issues but downplayed the¬†severity. However, Bitwarden told BleepingComputer that the issues have been fixed in version 2025.8.0, rolling out this week.\nIt is unclear if LastPass and 1Password are planning to address the problem.\nLogMeOnce did not respond to any communication attempts, either by T√≥th or Socket.\nCurrently, the following password managers, which together have around 40 million users,¬†are vulnerable to T√≥th's attack methods\n1Password 8.11.4.27\nBitwarden 2025.7.0\nEnpass 6.11.6 (partial fix implemented in 6.11.4.2)\niCloud Passwords 3.1.25\nLastPass 4.146.3\nLogMeOnce 7.12.4\nThe vendors that implemented fixes are Dashlane (v6.2531.1 released on August 1), NordPass, ProtonPass, RoboForm, and Keeper (v17.2.0 released in July). However, users should make sure that they're running the latest available versions of the products.\nCurrent vulnerability status\nSource:¬†Marek T√≥th\nUntil fixes become available, T√≥th recommends that users disable the autofill function in their password managers and only use copy/paste.\nBleepingComputer has contacted all vendors who haven‚Äôt pushed fixes onto their products yet, and we will update this post with their responses once they reach us.\n[Update¬†8/20 3:20 PM EST]\n- LastPass¬†and LogMeOnce reached out to BleepingComputer following the publication of this article to explain that they too are working on resolving the issues raised in¬†T√≥th's report.\n[Update 8/20 3:40 PM EST]\n- Edited the vendor notification timeline for better accuracy, based on new information received from Socket.\n[Update 8/20 4:15 PM EST]\n- LastPass sent BleepingComputer the following statement:\n\"We appreciate the work of security researchers, like Marek T√≥th, who help raise awareness about potential threats and improve industry-wide security. The clickjacking vulnerability Marek uncovered highlights a broader challenge facing all password managers: striking the right balance between user experience and convenience, while also addressing evolving threat models.\nLastPass has implemented certain clickjacking safeguards, including a pop-up notification that appears before auto-filling credit cards and personal details on all sites, and we‚Äôre committed to exploring ways to further protect users while continuing to preserve the experience our customers expect.\nIn the meantime, our threat intelligence, mitigation and escalation (TIME) team encourages all users of password¬†managers to remain vigilant, avoid interacting with suspicious overlays or pop-ups, and keep their LastPass extensions up to date.\" - Alex Cox, Director Threat Intelligence, Mitigation, Escalation (TIME) at LastPass.\nPicus Blue Report 2025 is Here: 2X increase in password cracking\n46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.\nGet the Picus Blue Report 2025 now for a comprehensive look at more findings on prevention, detection, and data exfiltration trends.\nGet the Blue Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nUK sentences ‚Äúserial hacker‚Äù of 3,000 sites to 20 months in prison\nWave of 150 crypto-draining extensions hits Firefox add-on store\nHackers exploit OttoKit WordPress plugin flaw to add admin accounts\nNew Android TapTrap attack fools users with invisible UI trick\nNew FileFix attack runs JScript while bypassing Windows MoTW alerts"

        "Summary": "Email security is stuck where antivirus was a decade ago‚Äîfocused only on prevention. Learn from Material Security why it's time for an \"EDR for email\" mindset: visibility, post-compromise controls, and SaaS-wide protection. [...]",
        "Date": "2025-08-20",
        "Content": "Security leaders today are rethinking email security, not because traditional methods have failed outright, but because the threat landscape and business needs have evolved beyond what legacy approaches can handle.\nA surprising but apt analogy keeps surfacing: email security is stuck where antivirus (AV) was a decade ago, and it‚Äôs time it evolved like AV did, into an element of EDR.\nThe comparison might not be obvious at first. After all, email and endpoints seem like apples and oranges.\nBut when you look deeper, especially at the way EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) grew from the core of AV, the parallel becomes impossible to ignore. Understanding that evolution offers a roadmap for what‚Äôs next in email security.\nAV to EDR: A Lesson in Resilience\nFor years, legacy AV promised total protection. The goal was to detect and block every malicious file. If a file looked good, it was allowed. If it matched a known signature of badness, it was blocked. This binary ‚Äúyes or no‚Äù model worked, until it didn‚Äôt.\nAttackers adapted. Malware became polymorphic. New threats emerged faster than vendors could write signatures. Eventually, the industry had to admit an uncomfortable truth: 100% prevention is impossible.\nThat‚Äôs when EDR entered the scene. Rather than trying to replace AV entirely, EDR surrounded it, adding visibility, detection of suspicious behavior, forensic capabilities, and remediation tools.\nCrucially, it introduced resilience into the security stack. Even if something slipped past AV, EDR was there to catch it later, investigate it, and limit its damage.\nThe endpoint had become a critical access point for attackers. Protecting it meant going beyond prevention, it required detection, response, and hardening.\nEmail Security: Caught in the Same Trap\nNow look at email security today.\nMost organizations still rely heavily on secure email gateways (SEGs) or built-in spam/phishing filters from providers like Google and Microsoft.\nThese tools are the AVs of email: they inspect inbound traffic, block the known-bad, and let the rest through. They‚Äôre great‚Ä¶ until they‚Äôre not.\nPhishing still happens.\nBusiness Email Compromise\n(BEC) is more sophisticated than ever. OAuth token abuse, insider threats, and hijacked accounts bypass traditional controls entirely. Like with AV, we‚Äôve hit the limits of ‚Äúprevent everything‚Äù.\nAnd like with endpoints, email is a powerful pivot point. A compromised inbox gives attackers access to sensitive files, apps, and downstream workflows‚Äîthink password resets, invoice fraud, or cloud file access.\nThe lesson from EDR applies perfectly: prevention alone isn‚Äôt enough. We need to invest in post-prevention controls, the ‚ÄúEDR for email‚Äù layer.\nThe Hidden Trends in Sensitive File Security\nOur Data Shows Sensitive Files Grew 1100%: Insights from Securing Email & Drive.\nMaterial Security‚Äôs analysis of email and cloud data uncovered surprising trends in how sensitive information is stored, shared, and secured, offering fresh perspective on evolving risks and defenses.\nRead the Report\nWhat EDR for Email Looks Like\nThis isn‚Äôt theoretical. It‚Äôs already happening.\nAt\nMaterial Security\n, we've taken an inside-out approach. Instead of starting with spam filtering or malicious link detection, we began with post-breach protections, tools that limit the impact after an attacker gets in.\nHere‚Äôs what that includes and the questions that get answered when security goes beyond an email mindset:\nVisibility:\nWho accessed which emails? When? From where? Visibility is foundational to understanding incidents.\nIncident Response:\nCan you retroactively revoke access to sensitive content if an account is compromised?\nGranular Access Controls:\nCan you lock down emails with sensitive content like financials or PII, even for internal users?\nRetention Policies\n:\nAre you keeping emails longer than needed, increasing your blast radius?\nIdentity Hardening:\nAre OAuth connections and email-based app signups tightly governed?\nThese aren't replacements for existing email filters. They‚Äôre supplementary and necessary functions for stopping a breach in its tracks. And just like EDR made AVsmarter, evolving past the perimeter functions of email security makes it more powerful.\nA Broader Security Shift\nIt‚Äôs not just about email anymore. As organizations rely more on Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace, the blast radius of an email account breach has widened. Attackers move laterally from inboxes into calendars, cloud storage, spreadsheets, and collaborative docs.\nSo the ‚ÄúEDR mindset‚Äù becomes all about expanding the work of security beyond email. Security should extend across the SaaS suite.\nMaterial Security has already started down this path, bringing the same visibility, access controls, and threat response to the rest of the productivity ecosystem.\nThat‚Äôs why we believe standalone email security is reaching the end of its road. It‚Äôs no longer enough to build bigger spam traps. We need integrated, layered defenses across the tools that power work.\nTime to Shift the Mental Model\nFor security teams, this shift requires a mindset change:\nFrom binary prevention ‚Üí to layered resilience\nFrom perimeter inspection ‚Üí to post-compromise visibility and control\nFrom point tools ‚Üí to integrated security architecture\nAV didn‚Äôt vanish when EDR arrived. It found its rightful place as part of a broader strategy. Email filtering will do the same. But organizations that fail to modernize risk being left with a brittle, prevention-only defense that no longer reflects how attackers work or how businesses operate.\nMaterial flagging a business email compromise (BEC) email\nJust as EDR reshaped endpoint protection, we believe the next evolution of email security is already underway. The question isn‚Äôt if it will happen. It‚Äôs whether you‚Äôll be ahead of the curve or playing catch-up after the next breach.\nWant to see what EDR for email looks like in action?\nLearn more about\nMaterial Security‚Äôs approach\nand\nsee purpose-built cloud workspace security in action.\nSponsored and written by\nMaterial Security\n."

Reports indicate similar symptoms on HDDs as well,\" they said.\n\"Our tests suggest that Phison NAND controllers are relatively prone to issues, with DRAM-less models from the same company tending to exhibit issues at lower write volumes.\"\nOther reportedly affected users\nhave encountered this issue\non systems with SanDisk Extreme Pro, Corsair Force MP600, Maxio SSD, KIOXIA EXCERIA PLUS G4, KIOXIA M.2 SSD, and other drives with Phison PS5012-E12 and InnoGrit controllers.\nMicrosoft reportedly working on a fix\nRedmond has yet to officially confirm this issue, however, a Microsoft spokesperson told BleepingComputer that the company is \"aware of these reports and are investigating with our partners.\"\nNAND controller maker Phison also shared¬†a statement with BleepingComputer saying that it's \"working with Microsoft to resolve the issue.\"\n\"Phison has recently been made aware of the industry-wide effects of the 'KB5063878' and 'KB5062660' updates on Windows 11 that potentially impacted several storage devices, including some supported by Phison,\" a spokesperson also told BleepingComputer.\n\"We understand the disruption this may have caused and promptly engaged industry stakeholders.
