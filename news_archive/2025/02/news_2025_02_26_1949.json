        "Content": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a virtual tour framework has been weaponized by malicious actors to inject malicious scripts across hundreds of websites with the goal of manipulating search results and fueling a spam ads campaign at scale.\nSecurity researcher Oleg Zaytsev, in a report shared with The Hacker News, said the campaign – dubbed\n360XSS\n– affected over 350 websites, including government portals, U.S. state government sites, American universities, major hotel chains, news outlets, car dealerships, and several Fortune 500 companies.\n\"This wasn't just a spam operation,\" the researcher\nsaid\n. \"It was an industrial-scale abuse of trusted domains.\"\nAll these websites have one thing in common: A popular framework called\nKrpano\nthat's used to embed 360° images and videos to facilitate interactive virtual tours and VR experiences.\nZaytsev said he stumbled upon the campaign after coming across a pornography-related ad listed on Google Search but with a domain associated with Yale University (\"virtualtour.quantuminstitute.yale[.]edu\").\nA notable aspect of these URLs is an XML parameter that's designed to redirect the site visitor to a second URL that belongs to another legitimate website, which is then used to execute a Base64-encoded payload via an XML document. The decoded payload, for its part, fetches the target URL (i.e., the ad) from yet another legitimate site.\nThe XML parameter passed in the original URL served in the search results is part of a broader configuration setting named \"\npassQueryParameters\n\" that's\nused\nwhen\nembedding a Krpano panorama viewer\ninto an HTML page. It's specifically designed to pass HTTP parameters from the URL to the viewer.\nThe security issue here is that if the option is enabled, it opens the door to a scenario where an attacker could use a specially crafted URL to execute a malicious script in a victim's web browser when the vulnerable site is visited.\nIndeed, a\nreflected XSS flaw\narising as a result of this behavior was disclosed in Krpano in late 2020 (\nCVE-2020-24901\n, CVSS score: 6.1), indicating that the\npotential for abuse\nhas been publicly known for over four years.\nWhile an update introduced in version 1.20.10 restricted \"passQueryParameters\" to an allowlist in an attempt to prevent such XSS attacks from taking place, Zaytsev found that explicitly adding the XML parameter to the allowlist reintroduced the XSS risk.\n\"Since version 1.20.10, Krpano's default installation was not vulnerable,\" the researcher told The Hacker News via email. \"However, configuring passQueryParameter in combination with the XML parameter allowed external XML configuration via the URL, leading to an XSS risk.\"\n\"The exploited versions I've come across were primarily older ones, predating version 1.20.10.\"\nThe campaign, per Zaytsev, has leveraged this weakness to hijack over 350 sites to serve sketchy ads related to pornography, diet supplements, online casinos, and fake news sites. What's more, some of these pages have been weaponized to boost YouTube video views.\nThe campaign is noteworthy, not least because it abuses the trust and credibility of legitimate domains to show up prominently in search results, a technique called\nsearch engine optimization (SEO) poisoning\n, which, in turn, is accomplished by abusing the XSS flaw.\n\"A reflected XSS is a fun vulnerability but on its own requires user interaction, and one of the biggest challenges is to make people click your reflected XSS link,\" Zaytsev said. \"So using search engines as a distribution platform for your XSS is a very creative and cool way to do it.\"\nFollowing responsible disclosure, the latest release of Krpano eliminates support for external configuration via the XML parameter, thereby mitigating the risk of XSS attacks even when the setting is used.\n\"Improved embedpano() passQueryParameters security: data-urls and external URLs are generally not allowed as parameter values anymore and URLs for the XML parameter are limited to be within the current folder structure,\" according to the\nrelease notes\nfor version 1.22.4 released this week.\nIt's currently not known who is behind the massive operation, although the abuse of an XSS flaw to serve just redirects, as opposed to carrying out more nefarious attacks like credential or cookie theft, raises the possibility of an ad firm with questionable practices that's serving these ads as a monetization strategy.\nUsers of Krpano are advised to update their installations to the latest version and set the \"passQueryParameters\" setting to false. Affected website owners are recommended to find and remove infected pages via Google Search Console.\nFound this article interesting?

The identity of the leaker remains a mystery.\nBlack Basta\nfirst came under the spotlight in April 2022, using the now-largely-defunct QakBot (aka QBot) as a delivery vehicle. According to an advisory published by the U.S. government in May 2024, the double extortion crew is estimated to have targeted more than 500 private industry and critical infrastructure entities in North America, Europe, and Australia.\nPer Elliptic and Corvus Insurance, the prolific ransomware group is estimated to have\nnetted at least $107 million\nin Bitcoin ransom payments from more than 90 victims by the end of 2023.\nSwiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT said the financially motivated threat actor, also tracked as Vengeful Mantis, has been \"mostly inactive since the start of the year\" due to internal strife, with some of its operators scamming victims by collecting ransom payments without providing a working decryptor.\nWhat's more, key members of the Russia-linked cybercrime syndicate are said to have jumped ship to the\nCACTUS\n(aka Nurturing Mantis) and Akira ransomware operations.\n\"The internal conflict was driven by 'Tramp' (LARVA-18), a known threat actor who operates a spamming network responsible for distributing QBot,\" PRODAFT said in a post on X. \"As a key figure within BLACKBASTA, his actions played a major role in the group's instability.\"\nSome of the\nsalient\naspects\nof the leak, which contains nearly 200,000 messages, are listed below -\nLapa is one of the main administrators of Black Basta and involved in administrative tasks\nCortes is associated with the QakBot group, which has sought to distance itself in the wake of Black Basta's attacks against Russian banks\nYY is another administrator of Black Basta who is involved in support tasks\nTrump is one of the aliases for \"the group's main boss\" Oleg Nefedov, who goes by the names GG and AA\nTrump and another individual, Bio, worked together in the now-dismantled\nConti ransomware scheme\nOne of the Black Basta affiliates is believed to be a minor aged 17 years\nBlack Basta has begun to actively\nincorporate social engineering\ninto their attacks following the success of\nScattered Spider\nAccording to Qualys, the Black Basta group leverages known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and insufficient security controls to obtain initial access to target networks.

        "Content": "Organizations today face relentless cyber attacks, with high-profile breaches hitting the headlines almost daily. Reflecting on a long journey in the security field, it's clear this isn't just a human problem—it's a math problem. There are simply too many threats and security tasks for any SOC to manually handle in a reasonable timeframe. Yet, there is a solution. Many refer to it as SOC 3.0—an AI-augmented environment that finally lets analysts do more with less and shifts security operations from a reactive posture to a proactive force. The transformative power of SOC 3.0 will be detailed later in this article, showcasing how artificial intelligence can dramatically reduce workload and risk, delivering world-class security operations that every CISO dreams of. However, to appreciate this leap forward, it's important to understand how the SOC evolved over time and why the steps leading up to 3.0 set the stage for a new era of security operations.\nA brief history of the SOC\nFor decades, the Security Operations Center (SOC) has been the front line for defending organizations against cyber threats. As threats become faster and more sophisticated, the SOC must evolve. I've personally witnessed three distinct phases of SOC evolution. I like to refer to them as SOC 1.0 (Traditional SOC), SOC 2.0 (the current, partly automated SOC), and SOC 3.0 (the AI-powered, modern SOC).\nIn this article I provide an overview of each phase, focusing on four core functions:\nAlert triage and remediation\nDetection & correlation\nThreat investigation\nData processing\nSOC 1.0: The traditional, manual SOC\nLet's take a look at how the earliest SOCs handled alert triage and remediation, detection & correlation, threat investigation and data processing.\nHandling noisy alerts with manual triage & remediation\nIn the early days, we spent an inordinate amount of time on simple\ntriage\n. Security engineers would build or configure alerts, and the SOC team would then struggle under a never-ending flood of noise. False positives abounded.\nFor example, if an alert fired every time a test server connected to a non-production domain, the SOC quickly realized it was harmless noise. We'd exclude low-severity or known test infrastructure from logging or alerting. This back and forth—\"Tune these alerts!\" or \"Exclude this server!\"—became the norm. SOC resources were invested more in managing alert fatigue than in addressing real security problems.\nRemediation\n, too, was entirely manual. Most organizations had a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) stored in a wiki or SharePoint. After an alert was deemed valid, an analyst would walk through the SOP:\n\"Identify the affected system\"\n\"Isolate the host\"\n\"Reset credentials\"\n\"Collect logs for forensics\", and so on.\nThese SOPs lived primarily in static documents, requiring manual intervention at every step. The main tools in this process were the SIEM (often a platform like QRadar, ArcSight, or Splunk) combined with collaboration platforms like SharePoint for knowledge documentation.\nEarly SIEM and correlation challenges\nDuring the SOC 1.0 phase,\ndetection and correlation\nmostly meant manually written queries and rules. SIEMs required advanced expertise to build correlation searches. SOC engineers or SIEM specialists wrote complex query logic to connect the dots between logs, events, and known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). A single missed OR or an incorrect join in a search query could lead to countless false negatives or false positives. The complexity was so high that only a small subset of expert individuals in the organization could maintain these rule sets effectively, leading to bottlenecks and slow response times.\nOnlyExperts for L2 & L3 threat investigation\nThreat investigations\nrequired highly skilled (and expensive) security analysts. Because everything was manual, each suspicious event demanded that a senior analyst perform log deep dives, run queries, and piece together the story from multiple data sources. There was no real scalability; each team could only handle a certain volume of alerts. Junior analysts were often stuck at Level 1 triage, escalating most incidents to more senior staff due to a lack of efficient tools and processes.\nManual pipelines for data processing\nWith big data came big problems such as manual data ingestion and parsing. Each log source needed its own integration, with specific parsing rules and indexing configuration. If you changed vendors or added new solutions, you'd spend months or even multiple quarters on integration. For SIEMs like QRadar, administrators had to configure new database tables, data fields, and indexing rules for each new log type. This was slow, brittle, and prone to human error. Finally, many organizations used separate pipelines for shipping logs to different destinations. This was also manually configured and likely to break whenever sources changed.\nIn short,\nSOC 1.0\nwas marked by high costs, heavy manual effort, and a focus on \"keeping the lights on\" rather than on true security innovation.\nSOC 2.0: The current, partly automated SOC\nThe challenges of SOC 1.0 spurred innovation. The industry responded with platforms and approaches that automated (to some degree) key workflows.\nEnriched alerts & automated playbooks\nWith the advent of SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response),\nalerts in the SIEM could be enriched automatically\n. An IP address in an alert, for example, could be checked against threat intelligence feeds and geolocation services. A host name could be correlated with an asset inventory or vulnerability management database. This additional context empowered analysts to decide faster whether an alert is credible.\nAutomated SOPs\nwas another big improvement. SOAR tools allowed analysts to codify some of their repetitive tasks and run \"playbooks\" automatically. Instead of referencing a wiki page step by step, the SOC could rely on automated scripts to perform parts of the remediation, like isolating a host or blocking an IP.\nHowever, the decision-making piece between enrichment and automated action remained highly manual.\nAnalysts might have better context, but they still had to think through what to do next. And to make matters worse, the SOAR tools themselves (e.g., Torq, Tines, BlinkOps, Cortex XSOAR, Swimlane) needed extensive setup and maintenance. Expert security engineers had to create and constantly update playbooks. If a single external API changed, entire workflows could fail. Simply replacing your endpoint vendor would trigger weeks of catch up in a SOAR platform. The overhead of building and maintaining these automations is not exactly trivial.\nUpgraded SIEM: Out-of-the-box detection & XDR\nIn SOC 2.0, detection and correlation saw key advances in out-of-the-box content. Modern SIEM platforms and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) solutions offer libraries of pre-built detection rules tailored to common threats, saving time for SOC analysts who previously had to write everything from scratch. Tools like Exabeam, Securonix, Gurucul and Hunters aim to correlate data from multiple sources (endpoints, cloud workloads, network traffic, identity providers) more seamlessly. Vendors like Anvilogic or Panther Labs provide libraries of comprehensive rule sets for various sources, significantly reducing the complexity of writing queries.\nIncremental improvements in threat investigation\nDespite XDR advances, the actual threat investigation workflow remains very similar to SOC 1.0. Tools are better integrated and more data is available at a glance, but the analysis process still relies on manual correlation and the expertise of seasoned analysts. While XDR can surface suspicious activity more efficiently, it doesn't inherently automate the deeper forensic or threat-hunting tasks. Senior analysts remain crucial to interpret nuanced signals and tie multiple threat artifacts together.\nStreamlined integrations & data cost control\nData processing in SOC 2.0 has also improved with\nmore Integrations\nand better control over multiple data pipelines. For example, SIEMs like Microsoft Sentinel offer automatic parsing and built-in schemas for popular data sources. This accelerates deployment and shortens time-to-value. Solutions like CRIBL allow organizations to define data pipelines once and route logs to the right destinations in the right format with the right enrichments. For example, a single data source might be enriched with threat intel tags and then sent to both a SIEM for security analysis and a data lake for long-term storage.\nThese improvements certainly help reduce the burden on the SOC, but maintaining these integrations and pipelines can still be complex. Moreover, the cost of storing and querying massive volumes of data in a cloud-based SIEM or XDR platform remains a major budget item.\nIn sum,\nSOC 2.0\ndelivered significant progress in automated enrichment and remediation playbooks.\nBut the heavy lifting—critical thinking, contextual decision-making, and sophisticated threat analysis—remains manual and burdensome.\nSOC teams still scramble to keep up with new threats, new data sources, and the overhead of maintaining automation frameworks.\nSOC 3.0: The AI-powered, modern SOC\nEnter\nSOC 3.0\n, where artificial intelligence and distributed data lakes promise a quantum leap in operational efficiency and threat detection.\nAI-driven triage & remediation\nThanks to breakthroughs in AI, the SOC can now automate much of the triage and investigation process with\nAI.\nMachine learning models—trained on vast datasets of normal and malicious behavior—can automatically classify and prioritize alerts with minimal human intervention. AI models are also packed with security knowledge which helps augment human analysts' capability to efficiently research and apply new information to their practices.\nInstead of building rigid playbooks,\nAI dynamically generates response options\n. Analysts can review, modify, and execute these actions with a single click. Once a SOC team gains trust in AI-augmented responses they can let the system remediate automatically, further reducing response times.\nThis doesn't eliminate human oversight, with\nhumans-in-the-loop reviewing the AI's triage reasoning and response recommendations\n, but it does drastically reduce the manual, repetitive tasks that bog down SOC analysts. Junior analysts can focus on high-level validation and sign-off, while AI handles the heavy lifting.\nAdaptive detection & correlation\nThe SIEM (and XDR) layer in SOC 3.0 is far more automated with AI/ML models, rather than human experts, creating and maintaining correlation rules. The system continuously learns from real-world data, adjusting rules to reduce false positives and detect novel attack patterns.\nOngoing threat intelligence feeds, behavioral analysis, and context from across the entire environment come together in near real-time. This intelligence is automatically integrated, so the SOC can adapt instantly to new threats without waiting for manual rule updates.\nAutomated deep-dive threat investigations\nArguably the most transformative change is in how AI enables near-instantaneous investigations with no need to codify. Instead of writing a detailed manual or script for investigating each type of threat, AI engines process and query large volumes of data and produce contextually rich investigation paths.\nDeep analysis at high speed is all in a day's work for AI as it can correlate thousands of events and logs from distributed data sources within minutes and often within seconds, surfacing the most relevant insights to the analyst.\nFinally, SOC 3.0 empowers junior analysts\nas even a Level 1 or 2 analyst can use these AI-driven investigations to handle incidents that would traditionally require a senior staff member. Vendors in this space include startups offering AI-based security co-pilots and automated SOC platforms that\ndrastically shorten investigation time and MTTR\n.\nDistributed data lakes & optimized spend\nWhile the volume of data required to fuel AI-driven security grows,\nSOC 3.0\nrelies on a more intelligent approach to data storage and querying:\nDistributed data lake\nAI-based tools don't necessarily rely on a single, monolithic data store. Instead, they can query data where it resides—be it a legacy SIEM, a vendor's free-tier storage, or an S3 bucket you own.\nThis approach is critical for cost optimization. For instance, some EDR/XDR vendors like CrowdStrike or SentinelOne offer free storage for 1st party data, so it's economical to keep that data in their native environment. Meanwhile, other logs can be stored in cheaper cloud storage solutions.\nFlexible, on-demand queries\nSOC 3.0 enables organizations to \"bring the query to the data\" rather than forcing all logs into a single expensive repository. This means you can leverage a cost-effective S3 bucket for large volumes of data, while still being able to rapidly query and enrich it in near real-time.\nData residency and performance concerns are also addressed by distributing the data in the most logical location—closer to the source, in compliance with local regulations, or in whichever geography is best for cost/performance trade-offs.\nAvoiding vendor lock-in\nIn SOC 3.0, you're not locked into a single platform's storage model. If you can't afford to store or analyze everything in a vendor's SIEM, you can still choose to keep it in your own environment at a fraction of the cost—yet still query it on demand when needed.\nConclusion\nFrom a CISO's vantage point,\nSOC 3.0\nisn't just a buzzword. It's the natural next step in modern cybersecurity, enabling teams to handle more threats at lower cost, with better accuracy and speed. While AI won't replace the need for human expertise, it will fundamentally shift the SOC's operating model—\nallowing security professionals to do more with less\n, focus on strategic initiatives, and maintain a stronger security posture against today's rapidly evolving threat landscape.\nAbout Radiant Security\nRadiant Security provides an AI-powered SOC platform designed for SMB and enterprise security teams looking to fully handle 100% of the alerts they receive from multiple tools and sensors.

It's currently not known how it reaches its targets, but what's known is that it requires the victim to explicitly run it on their Linux machine.\nA notable aspect of the malware is the arsenal of tricks it employs to evade detection. This includes using seemingly-innocuous file names like door or egg, concealing command-and-control (C2) connections, and leveraging proprietary encryption algorithms for masking communication and configuration information.\nOnce launched with root privileges, it proceeds to install a malicious library implant named \"libcext.so.2,\" copies and renames itself to /var/log/cross/auto-color, and makes modifications to \"/etc/ld.preload\" for establishing persistence on the host.\n\"If the current user lacks root privileges, the malware will not proceed with the installation of the evasive library implant on the system,\" Armstrong said. \"It will proceed to do as much as possible in its later phases without this library.\"\nThe library implant is equipped to passively hook functions used in\nlibc\nto intercept the\nopen() system call\n, which it uses to hide C2 communications by modifying \"/proc/net/tcp,\" a file that contains information on all active network connections. A similar technique was adopted by another Linux malware called\nSymbiote\n.\nIt also prevents uninstallation of the malware by protecting the \"/etc/ld.preload\" against further modification or removal.\nAuto-color then proceeds to contact a C2 server, granting the operator the ability to spawn a reverse shell, gather system information, create or modify files, run programs, use the machine as a proxy for communication between a remote IP address and a specific target IP address, and even uninstall itself by means of a kill switch.\n\"Upon execution, the malware attempts to receive remote instructions from a command server that can create reverse shell backdoors on the victim's system,\" Armstrong said. \"The threat actors separately compile and encrypt each command server IP using a proprietary algorithm.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Passwords are rarely appreciated until a security breach occurs; suffice to say, the importance of a strong password becomes clear only when faced with the consequences of a weak one. However, most end users are unaware of just how vulnerable their passwords are to the most common password-cracking methods. The following are the three common techniques for cracking passwords and how to defend against them.\nBrute force attack\nBrute force attacks are straightforward yet highly effective techniques for cracking passwords. These attacks involve malicious actors using automated tools to systematically try every possible password combination through repeated login attempts. While such tools have existed for years, the advent of affordable computing power and storage has made them even more efficient today, especially when weak passwords are used.\nHow it works\nWhen it comes to brute force attacks, malicious actors employ a range of tactics—from simple brute force attacks that test every possible password combination to more nuanced approaches like hybrid and reverse brute force attacks. Each method has a distinct strategy behind it, but the motives behind brute force attacks are the same: to gain unauthorized access to protected data or resources.\nSome popular automated tools for carrying out brute force attacks include:\nJohn the Ripper\n: a multiplatform password cracker with support for 15 different operating systems and hundreds of hashes and cipher types\nL0phtCrack\n: a tool that uses rainbow tables, dictionaries, and multiprocessor algorithms to crack Windows passwords\nHashcat\n: a cracking/password recovery utility that supports five unique modes of attack for over 300 highly-optimized hashing algorithms\nExamples\nBack in August 2021, U.S. mobile operator T-Mobile fell victim to a\ndata breach\nthat started with a brute force attack. The security compromise resulted in the exposure of over 37 million customer records containing sensitive data like social security numbers, driver's license information, and other personally identifiable data.\nDefense measures\nUsers should choose strong, complex passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect against brute force attacks. Administrators should implement account lockout policies and continuously audit their Windows environments for weak and breached passwords. Tools like\nSpecops Password Auditor\ncan automate these processes across expansive IT environments.\nDictionary attack\nIn a password dictionary attack, cyber attackers try to gain access by using a list of common passwords or words from a dictionary. This predefined word list typically includes the most often used words, phrases, and simple combinations (i.e., \"admin123\"). Password dictionary attacks underscore the importance of complex, unique passwords, as these attack types are especially effective against weak or easily guessable passwords.\nHow it works\nThe process starts with compiling a list of potential passwords from data breaches, common password lists, or publicly available resources. Using an automated tool, malicious actors perform a dictionary attack, systematically testing each password against a target account or system. If a match is found, the hacker can gain access and carry out subsequent attacks or movements.\nExamples\nMalicious actors used password dictionaries to crack hashed passwords in several high-profile security incidents, such as the\n2013 Yahoo data breach\nand the\n2012 LinkedIn data breach\n. This allowed them to steal the account information of billions of users.\nDefense measures\nWhen creating or\nresetting passwords\n, users should use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, and avoid using common words or easily guessable phrases. Administrators can implement password complexity requirements in their\npolicies\nto enforce these mandates across the organization.\nRainbow table attacks\nA rainbow table attack uses a special table (i.e., a \"Rainbow Table) made up of precomputed strings or commonly used passwords and corresponding hashes to crack the password hashes in a database.\nHow it works\nRainbow table attacks work by exploiting chains of hashing and reduction operations to efficiently crack hashed passwords. Potential passwords are first hashed and stored alongside their plaintext counterparts in the rainbow table, then processed with a reduction function that maps them to new values, resulting in a chain of hashes. This process is repeated multiple times to build the rainbow table. When hackers obtain a\nhash list\n, they can reverse lookup each hash value in the rainbow table—once a match is identified, the corresponding plaintext password is exposed.\nExamples\nWhile salting (a method of adding random characters to passwords before hashing) has reduced the effectiveness of rainbow table attacks, many hashes remain unsalted; additionally, advances in GPUs and affordable hardware have eliminated the storage limitations once associated with rainbow tables. As a result, these attacks continue to be a likely tactic in current and future high-profile cyber-attacks.\nDefense measures\nAs mentioned previously, salted hashes have significantly reduced the effectiveness of precomputed tables; organizations should therefore implement strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt) in their password processes. Administrators should also regularly update and rotate passwords to reduce the likelihood of rainbow table dictionary matches/hits.\nIn short, passwords aren't perfect, but complex and sufficiently long passphrases remain a vital first line of defense against advanced password-cracking techniques. Tools like\nSpecops Policy\nprovide an extra layer of protection by continuously scanning Active Directory against a database of over 4 billion breached passwords.\nContact us for a free demo today\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

Our security researchers at Microsoft confirmed this claims and found additional suspicious code.\"\n\"We banned the publisher from the VS Marketplace and removed all of their extensions and uninstalled from all VS Code instances that have this extension running. For clarity - the removal had nothing to do about copyright/licenses, only about potential malicious intent.\"\nVSCode automatically removing Material Theme extensions\nSource:\nbsdahl\nThe researchers told BleepingComputer that their specialized scanner detected malicious activity in the extension's code. One of the researchers, Amit Assaraf, says they believe the malicious code was introduced in an update to the extensions, indicating either a supply chain attack through a dependency or the developer's account was compromised.\nScanner's risk evaluation for Material Theme\nSource: app.extensiontotal.com\nMoreover, they explained that themes should be static JSON files and not execute any code, so this behavior was marked as suspicious in their evaluation.\nAs verified by BleepingComputer, the \"release-notes.js\" files in the theme contain heavily obfuscated JavaScript, which is always a red flag in open-source software.\nHeavily obfuscated JavaScript in release-notes.js file\nSource: BleepingComputer\nA partial deobfuscation of the code showed numerous references to usernames and passwords. However, as the file was still heavily obfuscated, BleepingComputer could not determine in what way they were being referenced.\nMicrosoft says they will publish more details about the extension and any detected malicious activity to the\nVSMarketplace GitHub repository\nsoon.\nThe developer of the extensions, Mattia Astorino (aka equinusocio), responded to concerns about the extensions being malicious, stating that the issues are caused by outdated Sanity.io dependency that \"looks compromised.\"\n\"Dear @gegtor nothing harmful was ever shipped within Material Theme.,\" reads\na post from Astorino\nin Microsoft's VSMarketplace repository.\n\"We just had an outdated sanity.io dependency used since 2016 to show release notes from sanity headless CMS, that was the only issue they found.\"\n\"That dependency has been there since 2016 and passed every check since then, now it looks compromised but NO ONE from Microsoft reached us to remove it. They just pulled down everything causing issues to millions of users, and causing a loop in vscode (yep, it's their fault)\"\n\"They broke everything without ever reaching out to us for clarification. Removing the old dependency was a quick 30-second fix, but it seems that's just how Microsoft operates. We also ship an obfuscated index.js file that contains all the theme commands and logic. It's obfuscated because the extension is now closed-source; however, if you delete it, the extension will still function with plain JSON files.\"\nUntil the situation clears up and it's determined whether or not the extensions are malicious, it is recommended to remove the following from all projects:\nequinusocio.moxer-theme\nequinusocio.vsc-material-theme\nequinusocio.vsc-material-theme-icons\nequinusocio.vsc-community-material-theme\nequinusocio.moxer-icons\nThe developer, Astorino, later published what they claim is a \"completely rewritten extension\" without any dependencies named \"Fanny Themes\" to the VSCode Marketplace, which Microsoft subsequently removed.\nIn response to our questions about the obfuscated release-notes.js file, Astorino repeated what he posted to GitHub, stating that a @sanity dependency was compromised and could have been quickly removed if he had been notified.\n\"The release notes file was made and used to generate a web view to show changes from sanity.io, an headless cms, back in 2016,\" Astorino told BleepingComputer.\n\"Never touched it since then, as I was focused on the new version of the extension.

Following the incident, Sygnia's forensic investigation of Bybit's infrastructure did not discover any evidence of compromise.\nTheir conclusions were also confirmed today by the Safe Ecosystem Foundation in a\nstatement\nrevealing that the attack was conducted by first hacking into a Safe {Wallet} developer machine, which provided the threat actors with access to an account operated by Bybit.\n\"The forensic review into the targeted attack by the Lazarus Group on Bybit concluded that this attack targeted to the Bybit Safe was achieved through a compromised Safe{Wallet} developer machine resulting in the proposal of a disguised malicious transaction,\" Safe said.\nSince the incident, the Safe{Wallet} team has restored Safe{Wallet} on the Ethereum mainnet with a\nphased rollout\nthat temporarily removed the native Ledger integration, the signing device/method used in the Bybit crypto heist.\nThe phased rollout to restore Safe{Wallet} services also added further security measures, including enhanced monitoring alerts and additional validations for transaction hash, data, and signatures.\nSafe{Wallet} 's team says it has fully rebuilt and reconfigured all infrastructure and rotated all credentials to ensure that the attack vector has been removed and cannot be used in future attacks.\nWhile a forensic review by external security researchers found no vulnerabilities in the Safe smart contracts or the source code of its frontend and services, Safe advises users to remain vigilant and \"exercise extreme caution\" when signing transactions.\nLargest crypto heist in history\nAs BleepingComputer reported, the\nNorth Korean hackers intercepted a planned transfer of funds\nfrom one of Bybit's cold wallets into a hot wallet.

        "Content": "A threat actor tracked as 'EncryptHub,' aka Larva-208,  has been targeting organizations worldwide with spear-phishing and social engineering attacks to gain access to corporate networks.\nAccording to a report by Prodaft, which was published internally last week and made public yesterday, since June 2024, when EncryptHub initiated operations, it has\ncompromised at least 618 organizations\n.\nAfter gaining access, the threat actors install Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software, followed by the deployment of information stealers like Stealc and Rhadamanthys. In many observed cases, EncryptHub also deploys ransomware on compromised systems.\nProdaft told BleepingComputer that the threat group is affiliated with RansomHub and BlackSuit, having deployed both ransomware encryptors in the past and possibly acting as an initial access broker for them or a direct affiliate.\nHowever, in many attacks the researchers observed, the threat actors deployed a custom PowerShell data encryptor, so they maintain their own variant too.\nGaining initial access\nLarva-208's attacks involve SMS phishing, voice phishing, and fake login pages that mimic corporate VPN products like Cisco AnyConnect, Palo Alto GlobalProtect, Fortinet, and Microsoft 365.\nFake Cisco login page\nSource: Prodaft\nThe attackers typically impersonate IT support in their messages to the targets, claiming an issue with VPN access or a security concern with their account, directing them to log in on a phishing site.\nVictims receive links that redirect them to phishing login pages where their credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens (session cookies) are captured in real-time.\nOnce the phishing process is over, the victim is redirected to the service's real domain to avoid raising suspicion.\nOverview of the phishing process\nSource: Prodaft\nEncryptHub has bought over 70 domains that mimic the said products, such as 'linkwebcisco.com' and 'weblinkteams.com,' to increase the perceived legitimacy of the phishing pages.\nThe phishing sites are hosted on bulletproof hosting providers like Yalishanda, which ProDaft says does not typically respond to justified takedown requests.\nProdaft has also discovered there's another subgroup tracked as Larva-148, which helps purchase the domains used in the phishing campaigns, manage hosting, and set up the infrastructure.\nIt's possible that Larva-148 sells domains and phishing kits to EncryptHub, though their exact relationship hasn't been deciphered yet.\nDeploying malware\nOnce EncryptHub breaches a targeted system, it deploys various PowerShell scripts and malware to gain persistence, remote access, steal data, and encrypt files.\nFirst, they trick victims into installing RMM software like AnyDesk, TeamViewer, ScreenConnect, Atera, and Splashtop. This allows them to control the compromised system remotely, maintain long-term access, and make lateral movement possible.\nNext, they use different PowerShell scripts to deploy infostealers, such as Stealc, Rhadamanthys, and Fickle Stealer, to steal data stored in web browsers. This data includes saved credentials, session cookies, and cryptocurrency wallet passphrases.\nCustom PowerShell scripts used in the attacks\nSource: Prodaft\nBleepingComputer has also seen Python scripts that perform similar behavior for Linux and Mac devices.\nIn samples of the scripts seen by BleepingComputer, the threat actor attempts to steal a large amount of data from breached systems, including:\nData from various cryptocurrency wallets, including MetaMask, Ethereum Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, Opera Wallet, Brave Wallet, TronLink, Trezor Wallet, and many others.\nConfiguration data for various VPN clients, including Cisco VPN Client, FortiClient, Palto Alto Networks GlobalProtect, OpenVPN, and WireGuard.\nData from popular password managers, including Authenticator, 1Password, NordPass, DashLane, Bitwarden, RoboForm, Keeper, MultiPassword, KeePassXC, and LastPass.\nFiles that match particular extensions or whose names contain certain keywords, including images, RDP connection files, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, and certificates. Some of the keywords in file names that are targeted include \"pass\", \"account\", \"auth\", \"2fa\", \"wallet\", \"seedphrase\", \"recovery\", \"keepass\", \"secret\", and many others.\nLarva-208's final threat is ransomware in the form of a custom PowerShell-based encryptor that encrypts files using AES and appends the \".crypted\" extension, deleting original files.\nA ransom note is generated for the victims, demanding a ransom payment in USDT via Telegram.\nLarva-208's ransom note\nSource: Prodaft\nProdaft says EncryptHub is a sophisticated threat actor that tailors its attacks for better effectiveness, achieving high-value breaches on large organizations.\n\"The LARVA-208 spear-phishing actor examined in this report exemplifies the increasing sophistication of targeted cyber attacks,\" warns Prodaft.\n\"By employing highly customized social engineering tactics, advanced obfuscation methods, and meticulously crafted lures, this threat actor has demonstrated a significant capability to evade detection and compromise high-value targets.\"\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft: Hackers steal emails in device code phishing attacks\nLargest US addiction treatment provider notifies patients of data breach\nAustralian IVF giant Genea breached by Termite ransomware gang\nBlack Basta ransomware gang's internal chat logs leak online\nNew NailaoLocker ransomware used against EU healthcare orgs"

        "Content": "Windows Active Directory (AD) service accounts are prime cyber-attack targets due to their elevated privileges and automated/continuous access to important systems. Windows Administrators should therefore implement strong security measures crucial for protecting AD environments from security compromises.\nThis article outlines five best practices to help secure your AD service accounts and reduce the risk of compromise by malicious actors.\nWhat are service accounts?\nAD service accounts are specialized accounts designed for running applications and services on Windows Servers. To support software-specific functions, service accounts require elevated permissions to manage the installation of applications and core services, and are often granted extensive access to the operating system infrastructure for dependent applications to function properly.\nThis expansive access level makes service accounts especially attractive targets for malicious actors looking to gain a foothold into critical systems.\nBy compromising a service account, attackers can often gain broad access across the network and visibility into other privileged systems.\nService account types\nService accounts come in three types: local user accounts, domain user accounts, managed services accounts (MSAs), and group managed service accounts (gMSAs).\nLocal user accounts\nLocal user accounts can log into a Windows system and access its resources and settings. Local user account types include:\nSystem accounts\n– have local, multi-privilege administration permissions\nLocal service accounts\n– have credential-less access to network services\nNetwork service accounts\n– have more robust, credentialed access to network services\nDomain user accounts\nServices running under a domain user account have all the local and network access granted to the account (or to any groups the account is a member of), with full access to the service security features of Windows and Microsoft AD Domain Services.\nManaged service accounts\nManaged service accounts (MSAs) are accounts tied to specific systems that you can use to securely run services, applications, and schedule tasks in the system’s AD domain. Because they use strict permissions controls via AD like role-based access control (RBAC) and maintenance automations, MSAs are considered the most secure service account type.\nGroup managed service accounts\nThe gMSA is a domain account that provides the same functionality as an MSA, but over multiple servers or services.\ngMSAs provide more security features than traditional managed service accounts such as automatic password management and simplified service principal name (SPN) management, to include management delegation to other administrators.\nThe importance of protecting service accounts\nWindows Administrators should prioritize service account protection, as cyber attackers commonly look to service accounts as a potential point of entry into protected systems.\nFor example,\nStorm-0501\nransomware attackers exploit over-privileged accounts when moving from organizations’ on-premises environments to cloud environments.\nThis allows them to gain network control, create persistent backdoor access to cloud environments, and deploy ransomware to the on-premises systems.\nFive best practices for securing AD service accounts\n1. Follow the Principle of Least Privilege\nWhen configuring service accounts, you should follow the principle of least privilege—that is, users and accounts should only have the minimum set of privileges required to perform their tasks. AD service accounts are designed to perform specific tasks and should therefore only possess the necessary permission to complete those tasks.\nBy granting excessive privileges (e.g., making a service account a domain or enterprise administrator), you introduce significant risk into your Windows environment.\n2. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible\nImplementing MFA\nfor all user accounts significantly enhances the security of your AD environment. Although service accounts are not usually intended for interactive logins that support MFA, it is essential to incorporate MFA into the interactive login processes of any service accounts that do.\n3. Remove service accounts not in use\nAD service accounts should be part of an active lifecycle management program, with any\nunused or unnecessary service accounts\npromptly disabled or flagged for attention. Interested to know how many unused service accounts you have in your AD?\nScan your AD with our free, read-only auditing tool and get an exportable report regarding inactive accounts and other password-related vulnerabilities.\nDownload Specops Password Auditor here\n.\n4. Monitor service account activity\nAD service accounts are prime targets for attackers and should be monitored closely for suspicious activity and anomalies (e.g.,\nunauthorized RDP access\nor use on inappropriate servers or workstations).\nFor auditing, Windows administrators should use a combination of native AD tools and\nthird party tools\nto track logon events and account changes.\n5. Enforce robust password policies across the organization\nAlthough MSAs and gMSAs automate password management, implementing a robust password policy across all accounts, including user accounts, enhances the overall security of your AD Domain Services.\nA third party tool such as\nSpecops Password Policy\ncan help you scale and enforce these policies across your organization, as well as continuously scanning your AD for breached passwords.\nTry Specops Password Policy for free\n.\nMaking service account protection a priority\nAD service accounts are essential for running automated processes and services but can pose significant security risks due to their elevated privileges. If compromised, they can allow attackers to escalate control, disrupt operations, access sensitive data, and move laterally within the network.\nBy following these five best practices, you can mitigate these risks and better protect your IT environment against AD service account-related compromises.\nAiming to secure your Active Directory in 2025?\nSpeak to a Specops expert\n.\nSponsored and written by\nSpecops Software\n."

        "Date": "2025-02-26",
        "Content": "​The Termite ransomware gang has claimed responsibility for stealing sensitive healthcare data in a recent breach of Genea, one of Australia's largest fertility services providers.\nThe IVF (in vitro fertilization) provider has been operating since 1986 (when it was known as Sydney IVF). It offers a wide range of services, including fertility treatments, tests, genetic services, preservation options, and donor programs, in 22 fertility clinics in New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia, Melbourne, Canberra, and Queensland.\nAccording to\nAustralia's national broadcaster\n, Genea and two other companies (Monash IVF and Virtus) account for over 80% of the industry's total revenue in the country.\nGenea\nfirst revealed\nlast Wednesday it was investigated a \"cyber incident\" after detecting \"suspicious activity\" on its network. In an\nupdated statement issued today\n, the fertility services giant confirmed the attackers stole data from its systems, which was later published online.\nThe company said it obtained a court-ordered injunction to prevent the leaked data from being shared by others, and it's also working with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Australian Cyber Security Centre to investigate an incident.\nThe\nredacted court order reveals\nthat the threat actors breached Genea's network on January 31, 2025, through a Citrix server. Subsequently, they gained access to the company's primary file server, domain controller, backup program, and BabySentry primary patient management system. Two weeks later, on February 14, the attackers exfiltrated 940.7GB of data from Genea's compromised systems to a DigitalOcean cloud server under their control.\nThe ongoing investigation also discovered that Genea's compromised patient management systems contained the following types of personal and health data, with the exposed information varying for each affected individual:\nFull names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, date of birth, emergency contacts, and next of kin,\nMedicare card numbers, private health insurance details, Defence DA numbers, medical record numbers, patient numbers,\nMedical history, diagnoses and treatments, medications and prescriptions, patient health questionnaire, pathology and diagnostic test results, notes from doctors and specialists, appointment details, and schedules.\n\"At this stage there is no evidence that any financial information such as credit card details or bank account numbers have been impacted by this incident,\" Genea added.\n\"The investigation is however ongoing, and we will keep you updated of any relevant further findings should they come to light.\"\nA Genea spokesperson has not replied to several requests for comment since the company disclosed the breach on February 19.\nBreach claimed by Termite ransomware\nWhile Genea didn't attribute the attack to a specific threat group or cybercrime operation, the Termite ransomware gang claimed responsibility on Monday.\nIn a new entry on their dark web leak site, they said they stole roughly 700GB of data and leaked screenshots of identification documents and patients' files allegedly stolen from Genea's network.\n\"We have ~700gb of data from company's servers such as confidential, personal data of clients,\" the threat actors claim.\nGenea entry on Termite's leak site (BleepingComputer)\nTermite is a ransomware operation that surfaced in mid-October, according to\nthreat intelligence company Cyjax\n, and has since listed 18 victims on its dark web portal from all over the world and various industry sectors.\nIn December, the ransomware gang also claimed to have\nbreached the network of Arizona-based service (SaaS) provider Blue Yonder\n. This worldwide supply chain software provider has over 3,000 customers, including high-profile companies such as Microsoft, Renault, Bayer, Tesco, Lenovo, DHL, 3M, Ace Hardware, Procter & Gamble, Carlsberg, Dole, Wallgreens, Western Digital, and 7-Eleven.\nLike other ransomware gangs, the Termite cybercrime group is involved in data theft, extortion, and encryption attacks. According to cybersecurity firm\nTrend Micro\n, they're using a version of the\nBabuk encryptor leaked in September 2021\nand are known to drop a \"How To Restore Your Files.txt\" ransom note on the victims' encrypted systems.\nTrend Micro also\nadded\nthat Termite's ransomware encryptor is still likely a work in progress, as it will terminate prematurely due to a code execution flaw.\nRelated Articles:\nBlack Basta ransomware gang's internal chat logs leak online\nLee Enterprises newspaper disruptions caused by ransomware attack\nMizuno USA says hackers stayed in its network for two months\nKrispy Kreme breach, data theft claimed by Play ransomware gang\nUN aviation agency confirms recruitment database security breach"

Information on Anubis comes from an analysis of the group’s dark web footprint rather than code analysis of the ransomware.\n\n\n\nAs with most ransomware groups today, Anubis uses double extortion. The researchers suggest that “Anubis appears to be an emerging threat, highlighting different business models employed by modern extortion actors.”\n\n\n\nKela bases its blog report on two Anubis actors that it is tracking on the dark web and on X. One, known as ‘superSonic’, advertised new affiliate programs on the RAMP cybercrime forum on February 23, 2025. These programs include Anubis Ransomware, Anubis Data Ransom, and Access Monetization.\n\n\n\nThe first option is classic ransomware, offering the affiliate 80% of the ransom achieved. The malware is written in ChaCha+ECIES, it targets Windows, Linux, NAS, and ESXi x64/x32 environments, and can be managed via a web portal.\n\n\n\nThe second (Data Ransom) provides a monetization service for data already stolen. The data provided must be exclusive to Anubis, stolen within the last six months, and ‘interesting for publication’. The revenue split here is 60% to the affiliate and 40% to Anubis.\n\n\n\nAccess Monetization pays access brokers 50% of subsequent revenue. The access must be in the US, Europe, Canada, or Australia, and the target must not have been attacked by other ransomware groups in the past year.\n\n\n\nAnubis also operates its own blog. At the time of writing, only three victims are detailed. A fourth, currently labeled ‘New – Top Secret’ was added on February 25, 2025. Noticeably, two of the remaining three, are healthcare institutions.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n\n\nThe first claimed victim was Pound Road Medical Centre (PRMC), an Australian healthcare firm. PRMC issued a statement that it had suffered a “cyber incident” on November 13, 2024, and that “patient data may have been accessed and taken by an unauthorized third party.”\n\n\n\n“However, there was no mention of ransomware, which suggests that Anubis’ current operations may focus on data extortion – or what Anubis themselves refer to as ‘Data Ransom’ – rather than traditional ransomware involving file encryption,” Kela told SecurityWeek.\n\n\n\nKela’s research suggests there is a new kid on the block. It also suggests that extortion based on data exfiltration alone (that is, without going to the trouble of encrypting the victims’ files) is a growing practice – and that Anubis is taking advantage of this to offer a post exfiltration extortion service.\n\n\n\nThis doesn’t mean that Anubis is ceasing the traditional RaaS encryption model. superSonic’s February 23 post provides a list of the encrypting ransomware’s capabilities. Kela has not had the opportunity to analyze any actual code caught in the wild (it’s all too new) so cannot verify whether the claims are valid. But if true, “Anubis’s operators may be experienced individuals, possibly former affiliates of other ransomware groups,” it states.\n\n\n\nIt is early days for a new threat group.
