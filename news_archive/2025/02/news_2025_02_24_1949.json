        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers are warning of a new campaign that leverages cracked versions of software as a lure to distribute information stealers like Lumma and ACR Stealer.\nThe AhnLab Security Intelligence Center (ASEC) said it has observed a spike in the distribution volume of ACR Stealer since January 2025.\nA notable aspect of the stealer malware is the use of a technique called\ndead drop resolver\nto extract the actual command-and-control (C2) server. This includes relying on legitimate services like Steam, Telegram's Telegraph, Google Forms, and Google Slides.\n\"Threat actors enter the actual C2 domain in Base64 encoding on a specific page,\" ASEC\nsaid\n. \"The malware accesses this page, parses the string, and obtains the actual C2 domain address to perform malicious behaviors.\"\nACR Stealer, previously\ndistributed\nvia Hijack Loader malware, is capable of harvesting a wide range of information from compromised systems, including files, web browser data, and cryptocurrency wallet extensions.\nThe development comes as ASEC revealed another campaign that uses files with the extension \"MSC,\" which can be executed by the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), to deliver the\nRhadamanthys\nstealer malware.\n\"There are two types of MSC malware: one exploits the vulnerability of apds.dll (CVE-2024-43572), and the other executes the 'command' command using Console Taskpad,\" the South Korean company\nsaid\n.\n\"The MSC file is disguised as an MS Word document. \"When the 'Open' button is clicked, it downloads and executes a PowerShell script from an external source. The downloaded PowerShell script contains an EXE file (Rhadamanthys).\"\nCVE-2024-43572, also called\nGrimResource\n, was first documented by the Elastic Security Labs in June 2024 as having been exploited by malicious actors as a zero-day. It was\npatched\nby Microsoft in October 2024.\nMalware campaigns have also been\nobserved\nexploiting chat support platforms like Zendesk, masquerading as customers to trick unsuspecting support agents into downloading a stealer called Zhong Stealer.\nAccording to a recent report published by Hudson Rock, over 30,000,000 computers have been infected by information stealers in the \"past few years,\" leading to the theft of corporate credentials and session cookies that could then be sold by cybercriminals on underground forums to other actors for profit.\nThe buyers could weaponize the access afforded by these credentials to stage post-exploitation actions of their own, leading to severe risks. These developments serve to highlight the role played by stealer malware as an\ninitial access vector\nthat provides a foothold to sensitive corporate environments.\n\"For as little as $10 per log (computer), cybercriminals can purchase stolen data from employees working in classified defense and military sectors,\" Hudson Rock\nsaid\n. \"Infostealer intelligence isn't just about detecting who's infected‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit's about understanding the full network of compromised credentials and third-party risks.\"\nOver the past year, threat actors have also been ramping up efforts to spread a variety of malware families, including stealers and remote access trojans (RATs), through a technique called\nClickFix\nthat often entails redirecting users to fake CAPTCHA verification pages instructing them to copy and execute nefarious PowerShell commands.\nOne such payload dropped is\nI2PRAT\n, which employs the I2P anonymization network to anonymize its final C2 server.\n\"The malware is an advanced threat composed of multiple layers, each incorporating sophisticated mechanisms,\" Sekoia\nsaid\n. \"The use of an anonymization network complicates tracking and hinders the identification of the threat's magnitude and spread in the wild.\"\nFound this article interesting?

This week, we look at a huge crypto theft, reveal some sneaky AI scam tricks, and discuss big changes in data protection.\nLet these stories spark your interest and help you understand the changing threats in our digital world.\n‚ö° Threat of the Week\nLazarus Group Linked to Record-Setting $1.5 Billion Crypto Theft\n‚Äî The North Korean Lazarus Group has been\nlinked\nto a \"sophisticated\" attack that led to the theft of over $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency from one of Bybit's cold wallets, making it the largest ever single crypto heist in history. Bybit said it detected unauthorized activity within one of our Ethereum (ETH) Cold Wallets during a planned routine transfer process on February 21, 2025, at around 12:30 p.m. UTC. The incident makes it the biggest-ever cryptocurrency heist reported to date, dwarfing that of Ronin Network ($624 million), Poly Network ($611 million), and BNB Bridge ($586 million).\nAutomate Manual Processes & Close Deals Faster with Drata\nFrom cost center to revenue driver, now is the time to transition to a modern approach to GRC. Drata delivers the world's most advanced Trust Management platform ‚Äì making risk and compliance accessible, continuous, and 10x more automated than ever before.\nDownload Report ‚ûù\nüîî Top News\nOpenAI Bans ChatGPT Accounts for Malicious Activities\n‚Äî OpenAI has\nrevealed\nthat it banned several clusters of accounts that used its ChatGPT tool for a wide range of malicious purposes. This included a network likely originating from China that used its artificial intelligence (AI) models to develop a suspected surveillance tool that's designed to ingest and analyze posts and comments from platforms such as X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram, and Reddit. Other instances of ChatGPT abuse consisted of creating social media content and long-form articles critical of the U.S., generating comments for propagating romance-baiting scams on social media, and assisting with malware development.\nApple Drops iCloud's Advanced Data Protection in the U.K.\n‚Äî Apple has\nstopped\noffering its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for iCloud in the United Kingdom with immediate effect, rather than complying with government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data. \"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,\" the company said. The development comes shortly after reports emerged that the U.K. government had ordered Apple to build a backdoor that grants blanket access to any Apple user's iCloud content.\nSalt Typhoon Leverages Years-Old Cisco Flaw for Initial Access\n‚Äî The China-linked hacking group called Salt Typhoon\nleveraged\na now-patched security flaw impacting Cisco devices (\nCVE-2018-0171\n) and obtaining legitimate victim login credentials as part of a targeted campaign aimed at major U.S. telecommunications companies. Besides relying extensively on living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques to evade detection, the attacks have led to the deployment of a bespoke utility called JumbledPath that allows them to execute a packet capture on a remote Cisco device through an actor-defined jump-host. Cisco described the threat actor as highly sophisticated and well-funded, consistent with state-sponsored hacking activity.\nRussian Hackers Exploit Signal's Linking Feature\n‚Äî Multiple Russia-aligned threat actors have been\nobserved\ntargeting individuals of interest via malicious QR codes that exploit the privacy-focused messaging app Signal's \"linked devices\" feature to gain unauthorized access to their accounts and eavesdrop on the messages. The attacks have been attributed to two clusters tracked as UNC5792 and UNC4221. The development comes as similar attacks have also been recorded against WhatsApp.\nWinnti Stages RevivalStone Campaign Targeting Japan\n‚Äî Winnti, a subgroup with the APT41 Chinese threat activity cluster,\ntargeted\nJapanese companies in the manufacturing, materials, and energy sectors in March 2024 that delivered a wide range of malware, including a rootkit that's capable of intercepting TCP/IP Network Interface, as well as creating covert channels with infected endpoints within the intranet. The activity has been codenamed RevivalStone.\n‚ÄéÔ∏è‚Äçüî• Trending CVEs\nYour go-to software could be hiding dangerous security flaws‚Äîdon't wait until it's too late!

He faces up to 10 years of prison for each count. Wagenius is also believed to have collaborated with Connor Riley Moucka (aka Judische) and John Binns, both of whom have been accused of stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies by breaking into their Snowflake instances.\nTwo Estonian Nationals Plead Guilty in $577M Cryptocurrency Fraud Scheme\n‚Äî Two Estonian nationals, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Tur√µgin, both 40, have pleaded guilty for the operation of a massive, multi-faceted cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme that claimed hundreds of thousands of people from across the world, including in the U.S. They have also agreed to forfeit assets valued over $400 million obtained during the operation of the illicit scheme. The defendants \"sold contracts to customers entitling them to a share of cryptocurrency mined by the defendants' purported cryptocurrency mining service, HashFlare,\" the Justice Department\nsaid\n. \"Between 2015 and 2019, Hashflare's sales totaled more than $577 million, but HashFlare did not possess the requisite computing capacity to perform the vast majority of the mining the defendants told HashFlare customers it performed.\" Potapenko and Tur√µgin each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. If convicted, they each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The disclosure comes as Indian law enforcement authorities\nseized\nnearly $190 million in cryptocurrency tied to the BitConnect scam. BitConnect is estimated to have defrauded over 4,000 investors across 95 countries, amassing $2.4 billion before its collapse in 2018. Its founder Satish Kumbhani was\ncharged\nby the U.S. in 2022, but he remained a fugitive until his whereabouts were traced to Ahmedabad.\nThailand Rescues 7,000 People from Myanmar Call Centers\n‚Äî Thailand Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra\nsaid\nsome 7,000 people have been rescued from illegal call center operations in Myanmar, and are waiting to be transferred to the country. In recent years, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos have become\nhotspots\nfor\nillicit romance baiting scams\n, with most of them run by organized cybercrime syndicates and staffed by people who were illegally trafficked into the region under the promise of high-paying jobs. They are then tortured and enslaved into running scams such as\nromance fraud\nand fake investment schemes online. \"We are facing an epidemic in the growth of financial fraud, leading to individuals, often vulnerable people, and companies being defrauded on a massive and global scale,\" INTERPOL noted last year. The United Nations\nestimated\nthat scams targeting victims across East and Southeast Asia caused financial losses between $18 billion and $37 billion in 2023.\nSanctioned Entities Fueled $16 billion in Crypto Activity\n‚Äî Sanctioned entities and jurisdictions were responsible for nearly $115.8 billion in cryptocurrency activity last year, accounting for about 39% of all illicit crypto transactions. \"In a departure from prior years, sanctioned jurisdictions accounted for a record share of total sanctions-related activity compared to individual entities, commanding nearly 60% of value by the end of 2024,\" Chainalysis said. This is driven by the continued emergence of no-KYC exchanges despite enforcement actions, as well as the resurgence of Tornado Cash, which has been the target of sanctions and arrests. \"The increase in Tornado Cash usage in 2024 was largely driven by stolen funds, which reached a three-year high, accounting for 24.4% of total inflows,\" the blockchain intelligence firm\nsaid\n. Another notable factor is the increasing use of digital currencies by Iranian services for sanctions-related crypto activity. Cryptocurrency outflows from Iran reached $4.18 billion in 2024, up about 70% year-over-year.\nU.S. Releases Russian Cybercriminal in Prison Swap\n‚Äî Alexander Vinnik, who\npleaded guilty\nlast year to money laundering charges in connection with operating the now-dismantled BTC-e cryptocurrency exchange, has been\nhanded over\nby the U.S. government to Russia in exchange for Marc Fogel, a school teacher sentenced to 14 years in prison for drug trafficking charges. He was originally\narrested\nin Greece in 2017. His sentencing was scheduled to take place in June 2025.\nBlack Hat SEO Campaign Targets Indian Sites\n‚Äî Threat actors have infiltrated Indian government, educational, and financial services websites, using malicious JavaScript code that leverage search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning techniques to\nredirect users\nto sketchy websites promoting online betting and other investment-focused games that claim to offer referral bonus. \"Targets of interest include websites with .gov.in , .ac.in TLDs and the usage of keyword stuffing mentioning well known financial brands in India,\" CloudSEK\nsaid\n. \"Over 150 government portals, most belonging to state governments, have been affected at scale.\" It's currently not known how these websites are being compromised. A similar campaign targeting Malaysian government websites has also been reported in the past.\nSky ECC Distributors Arrested in Spain, Netherlands\n‚Äî Four distributors of the encrypted communications service\nSky ECC\n, which was used extensively by criminals, have been\narrested\nin Spain and the Netherlands. The two suspects arrested in Spain are said to be the leading global distributors of the service, generating over ‚Ç¨13.5 million ($14 million) in profits. In March 2021, Europol announced that it was able to crack open Sky ECC's encryption, thereby allowing law enforcement to monitor the communications of 70,000 users and expose the criminal activity occurring on the platform.In late January, the Dutch Police\nannounced\nthe arrest of two men from Amsterdam and Arnhem for allegedly selling Sky ECC phones in the country.\nItalian Spyware Maker Linked to Malicious WhatsApp Clones\n‚Äî An Italian spyware company named SIO, which\noffers solutions\nfor monitoring suspect activities, gathering intelligence, or conducting covert operations, has been attributed as behind malicious Android apps that impersonate WhatsApp and other popular apps and are designed to steal private data from a target's device. The findings,\nreported\nby TechCrunch, demonstrate the various methods used to deploy such invasive software against individuals of interest. The spyware, codenamed Spyrtacus, can steal text messages, instant messaging chats, contacts, call logs, ambient audio, and images, among others. It's currently not known who was targeted with the spyware. The oldest artifact, per Lookout, dates back to 2019 and the most recent sample was discovered in mid-October 2024. Interestingly, Kaspersky revealed in May 2024 that it observed Spyrtacus being used to target individuals in Italy, stating it shared similarities with another stalkerware malware named HelloSpy. \"The threat actor first started distributing the malicious APK via Google Play in 2018, but switched to malicious web pages forged to imitate legitimate resources relating to the most common Italian internet service providers in 2019,\" the company\nsaid\n. The development comes as iVerify said it discovered 11 new cases of Pegasus spyware infection in December 2024 that go beyond politicians and activists. \"The new confirmed detections, involving known variants of Pegasus from 2021-2023, include attacks against users across government, finance, logistics, and real estate industries,\" iVerify\nsaid\n, adding in about half the cases, the victims did not receive any Threat Notifications from Apple.\nCryptoBytes Unleashes UxCryptor Malware\n‚Äî The financially motivated Russian threat actor known as CryptoBytes has been linked to a new ransomware called UxCryptor that uses leaked builders to create and distribute their malware. The group is active since at least 2023. \"UxCryptor is part of a broader trend of ransomware families that use leaked builders, making it accessible to less technically skilled malware operators,\" the SonicWall Capture Labs threat research team\nsaid\n. \"It is often delivered alongside other malware types, such as Remote Access Trojans (RATs) or information stealers, to maximize the impact of an attack. The malware is designed to encrypt files on the victim's system, demanding payment in cryptocurrency for decryption.\"\nThreat Actors Take a Mere 48 Minutes to Go From Initial Access to Lateral Movement\n‚Äî Cybersecurity company ReliaQuest, which recently responded to a manufacturing sector breach involving phishing and data exfiltration, said the attack achieved a breakout time of just 48 minutes, indicating that adversaries are\nmoving faster\nthan defenders can respond. The attack involved the use of email bombing techniques reminiscent of\nBlack Basta ransomware\n, followed by sending a Microsoft Teams message to trick victims into granting them remote access via\nQuick Assist\n. \"One user granted the threat actor control of their machine for over 10 minutes, giving the threat actor ample time to progress their attack,\" ReliaQuest\nsaid\n.\nRussia Plans New Measures to Tackle Cybercrime\n‚Äî The Russian government is\nsaid\nto have approved a series of measures aimed at combating cyber fraud. This includes tougher punishments for attackers, longer prison terms, and strengthening international cooperation by allowing the extradition of criminals hiding abroad to Russia for trial and punishment.\nüé• Expert Webinar\nWebinar 1:\nBuild Resilient Identity: Learn to Reduce Security Debt Before It Costs You\n‚Äî Join our exclusive webinar with Karl Henrik Smith and Adam Boucher as they reveal the Secure Identity Assessment‚Äîa clear roadmap to close identity gaps, cut security debt, and future-proof your defenses in 2025.

First, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your password manager to ensure that even if someone gets hold of your master password, they'll need an extra code to gain access. Use the built-in password generator to create long, unique passwords for every account, mixing letters, numbers, and symbols to make them nearly impossible to guess. Regularly run security audits within your manager to spot weak or repeated passwords, and take advantage of breach monitoring features that alert you if any of your credentials show up in data breaches. When you need to share a password, use the manager's secure sharing option to keep the data encrypted. Finally, ensure your password database is backed up in an encrypted format so you can safely restore your data if needed. These simple yet advanced steps turn your password manager into a powerful tool for keeping your online life secure.\nConclusion\nWe've seen a lot of action in the cyber world this week, with criminals facing charges and new scams coming to light.

        "Content": "Ransomware doesn't hit all at once‚Äîit slowly floods your defenses in stages. Like a ship subsumed with water, the attack starts quietly, below the surface, with subtle warning signs that are easy to miss. By the time encryption starts, it's too late to stop the flood.\nEach stage of a ransomware attack offers a small window to detect and stop the threat before it's too late. The problem is most organizations aren't monitoring for early warning signs - allowing attackers to quietly disable backups, escalate privileges, and evade detection until encryption locks everything down.\nBy the time the ransomware note appears, your opportunities are gone.\nLet's unpack the stages of a ransomware attack, how to stay resilient amidst constantly morphing indicators of compromise (IOCs), and why constant validation of your defense is a must to stay resilient.\nThe Three Stages of a Ransomware Attack - and How to Detect It\nRansomware attacks don't happen instantly. Attackers follow a structured approach, carefully planning and executing their campaigns across three distinct stages:\n1. Pre-Encryption: Laying the Groundwork\nBefore encryption begins, attackers take steps to maximize damage and evade detection. They:\nDelete shadow copies and backups to prevent recovery.\nInject malware into trusted processes to establish persistence.\nCreate mutexes to ensure the ransomware runs uninterrupted.\nThese early-stage activities - known as\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n- are critical warning signs. If detected in time, security teams can disrupt the attack before encryption occurs.\n2. Encryption: Locking You Out\nOnce attackers have control, they initiate the encryption process. Some ransomware variants work rapidly, locking systems within minutes, while others take a stealthier approach - remaining undetected until the encryption is complete.\nBy the time encryption is discovered, it's often too late. Security tools must be able to detect and respond to ransomware activity before files are locked.\n3. Post-Encryption: The Ransom Demand\nWith files encrypted, attackers deliver their ultimatum - often through ransom notes left on desktops or embedded within encrypted folders. They demand payment, usually in cryptocurrency, and monitor victim responses via command-and-control (C2) channels.\nAt this stage, organizations face a difficult decision: pay the ransom or attempt recovery, often at great cost.\nIf you're not proactively monitoring for IOCs across all three stages, you're leaving your organization vulnerable. By emulating a ransomware attack path, continuous ransomware validation helps security teams confirm that their detection and response systems are effectively detecting indicators before encryption can take hold.\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs): What to Look Out For\nIf you detect shadow copy deletions, process injections, or security service terminations, you may already be in the pre-encryption phase - but detecting these IOCs is a critical step to prevent the attack from unfolding.\nHere are key IOCs to watch for:\n1. Shadow Copy Deletion: Eliminating Recovery Options\nAttackers erase Windows Volume Shadow Copies to prevent file restoration. These snapshots store previous file versions and enable recovery through tools like System Restore and Previous Versions.\nüí°\nHow it works:\nRansomware executes commands like:\npowershell\nvssadmin.exe delete shadows\nBy wiping these backups, attackers ensure total data lockdown, increasing pressure on victims to pay the ransom.\n2. Mutex Creation: Preventing Multiple Infections\nA\nmutex (mutual exclusion object)\nis a synchronization mechanism that enables only one process or thread to access a shared resource at a time. In ransomware they can be used to:\n‚úî Prevent multiple instances of the malware from running.\n‚úî Evade detection by reducing redundant infections and reducing resource usage.\nüí°\nDefensive trick:\nSome security tools preemptively create mutexes associated with known ransomware strains, tricking the malware into thinking it's already active - causing it to self-terminate. Your ransomware validation tool can be used to assess if this response is triggered, by incorporating a mutex within the ransomware attack chain.\n3. Process Injection: Hiding Inside Trusted Applications\nRansomware often injects malicious code into\nlegitimate system processes\nto avoid detection and bypass security controls.\nüö©\nCommon injection techniques:\nDLL Injection\n‚Äì Loads malicious code into a running process.\nReflective DLL Loading\n‚Äì Injects a DLL without writing to disk, bypassing antivirus scans.\nAPC Injection\n‚Äì Uses\nAsynchronous Procedure Calls\nto execute malicious payloads within a trusted process.\nBy running inside a trusted application, ransomware can operate undetected, encrypting files without triggering alarms.\n4. Service Termination: Disabling Security Defenses\nTo ensure uninterrupted encryption and prevent data recovery attempts during the attack, ransomware attempts to\nshut down security services\nsuch as:\n‚úî Antivirus & EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)\n‚úî Backup agents\n‚úî Database systems\nüí°\nHow it works:\nAttackers use administrative commands or APIs to disable services like Windows Defender and backup solutions. For example:\npowershell\ntaskkill /F /IM MsMpEng.exe # Terminates Windows Defender\nThis allows ransomware to encrypt files freely while amplifying the damage by making it harder to recover their data. Leaving victims with fewer options besides paying the ransom.\nIOCs like shadow copy deletion or process injection can be invisible to traditional security tools - but a SOC equipped with reliable detection can spot these red flags before encryption begins.\nHow Continuous Ransomware Validation Keeps You One Step Ahead\nWith the nature of IOCs being subtle and intentionally difficult to detect, how do you know that your XDR is effectively knipping them all in the bud? You hope that it is, but security leaders are using\ncontinuous ransomware validation\nto get a lot more certainty than that. By safely emulating the full ransomware kill chain - from initial access and privilege escalation to encryption attempts - tools like\nPentera\nvalidate whether security controls, including EDR and XDR solutions, trigger the necessary alerts and responses. If key IOCs like shadow copy deletion, and process injection go undetected, then that's a crucial flag to prompt security teams to fine-tune detection rules and response workflows.\nInstead of hoping your defenses will work as they should, continuous ransomware validation enables you to see if and how these attack indicators were used and stop the attacks before they eventuate.\nWhy Annual Testing Isn't Enough\nHere's the reality: testing your defenses once a year leaves you exposed the other 364 days. Ransomware is constantly evolving, and so are the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) used in attacks. Can you say with certainty that your EDR is detecting every IOC it should? The last thing you need to stress about is how threats are constantly changing into something your security tools will fail to recognize and aren't prepared to handle.\nThat's why continuous ransomware validation is essential. With an automated process, you can continuously test your defenses to ensure they stand up against the latest threats.\nSome believe that continuous ransomware validation is too costly or time-consuming. But automated security testing can integrate seamlessly into your security workflow - without adding unnecessary overhead. This not only reduces the burden on IT teams but also ensures that your defenses are always aligned with the latest attack techniques.\nA Strong Ransomware Defense\nA well-equipped detection and response system is your first line of defense. But without regular validation, even the best XDR can struggle to detect and respond to ransomware in time. Ongoing security validation strengthens detection capabilities, helps to upskill the SOC team, and ensures that security controls are effectively responding to and blocking threats. The result? A more confident, resilient security team that's prepared to handle ransomware before it becomes a crisis.\nüö®\nDon't wait for an attack to test your defenses.

In addition to researching what tools to use during cyberattacks, the threat actors used ChatGPT to find information on cryptocurrency-related topics, which are common interests linked to North Korean state-sponsored threat groups.\nThe malicious actors also used ChatGPT for coding assistance, including help on how to use open-source Remote Administration Tools (RAT), as well as debugging, researching, and development assistance for open-source and publicly available security tools and code that could be used in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute force attacks.\nOpenAI threat analysts also found that the North Korean actors revealed staging URLs for malicious binaries unknown to security vendors at the time while debugging auto-start extensibility point (ASEP) locations and macOS attack techniques.\nThese staging URLs and the associated compiled executable files were submitted to an online scanning service to facilitate sharing with the broader security community. As a result, some vendors now reliably detect these binaries, protecting potential victims from future attacks.\nOther malicious activity uncovered by OpenAI while researching in what ways the North Korean threat actors used the banned accounts includes but is not limited to:\nAsking about vulnerabilities in various applications,\nDeveloping and troubleshooting a C#-based RDP client to enable,\nRequesting code to bypass security warnings for unauthorized RDP,\nRequested numerous PowerShell scripts for RDP connections, file upload/download, executing code from memory, and obfuscating HTML content,\nDiscusses creating and deploying obfuscated payloads for execution,\nSeeking methods to conduct targeted phishing and social engineering against cryptocurrency investors and traders, as well as more generic phishing content,\nCrafting phishing emails and notifications to manipulate users into revealing sensitive information.\nThe company also banned accounts linked to a potential\nNorth Korean IT worker scheme\n, described as having all the characteristics of efforts to obtain income for the Pyongyang regime¬†by tricking¬†Western companies into hiring North Koreans.\n\"After appearing to gain employment they used our models to perform job-related tasks like¬†writing code, troubleshooting and messaging with coworkers,\" OpenAI explained. \"They also used our models to¬†devise cover stories to explain unusual behaviors such as avoiding video calls, accessing¬†corporate systems from unauthorized countries or working irregular hours.\"\nSince October 2024, when it published its previous report, OpenAI has also detected and disrupted two campaigns originating from China, \"Peer Review\" and \"Sponsored Discontent.\" These campaigns used the ChatGPT models to research and develop tools linked to a surveillance operation and generate anti-American, Spanish-language articles.\nIn the\nOctober report\n, OpenAI revealed that since the beginning of 2024, it disrupted over twenty campaigns linked to cyber operations and covert influence operations associated with Iranian and Chinese state-sponsored hackers.\nRelated Articles:\nTime Bandit ChatGPT jailbreak bypasses safeguards on sensitive topics\nIntegrating LLMs into security operations using Wazuh\nGoogle Chrome's AI-powered security feature rolls out to everyone\nDPRK hackers dupe targets into typing PowerShell commands as admin\nMicrosoft raises rewards for Copilot AI bug bounty program"

Non-interactive sign-ins, commonly used for service-to-service authentication, legacy protocols (e.g., POP, IMAP, SMTP), and automated processes, do not trigger MFA in many configurations,\"\nwarns SecurityScorecard\n.\n\"Basic Authentication, still enabled in some environments, allows credentials to be transmitted in plain form, making it a prime target for attackers.\"\nFailed login attempts by the botnet\nSource: SecurityScorecard\nBasic Auth is an outdated authentication method where a user's credentials are sent in plaintext or base64 encoded form with every request to a server.\nIt lacks modern security features like MFA and token-based authentication, and Microsoft plans to deprecate it in favor of OAuth 2.0 in September 2025, already having disabled it for most Microsoft 365 services.\nThe newly discovered botnet uses Basic Auth attempts targeting a large number of accounts with common/leaked passwords.\nSince Basic Auth is non-interactive, when there's a match with the tried credentials, the attackers aren't prompted for MFA and very often aren't restricted by Conditional Access Policies (CAP), allowing the attackers to quietly verify account credentials.\nOnce credentials are verified, they can be used to access legacy services that do not require MFA or in more sophisticated phishing attacks to bypass the security feature and gain full access to the account.\nSecurityScorecard also highlights that you may be able to see signs of the password-spray attacks in Entra ID logs, which will show increased login attempts for non-interactive logins, multiple failed login attempts from different IPs, and the presence of the \"fasthttp\" user agent in the authentication logs.\nIn January, SpearTip warned of threat actors conducting Microsoft 365 password attacks\nusing the FastHTTP Go library\nin a similar manner but did not mention the non-interactive logins. It is unclear if that is a newer development by the botnet to evade detection.\nPossible link to Chinese threat actors\nSecurityScorecard reports that the operators of the botnet are likely Chinese-affiliated, although there's no clear or confident attribution yet.\nThe botnet operates through six primary command and control (C2) servers hosted by U.S. provider Shark Tech, while it proxies traffic through Hong Kong-based UCLOUD HK and China-linked CDS Global Cloud.\nThe C2 servers run Apache Zookeeper and use Kafka to manage botnet operations.\nThe system timezone on the C2 servers is set to Asia/Shanghai, while their uptimes indicate the botnet has been active since at least December 2024.\nPorts used by the C2 for botnet control\nSource: SecurityScorecard\nThe botnet uses over 130,000 compromised devices to spread out login attempts across different IP addresses, which helps evade getting flagged for suspicious activity and blocked.\nOrganizations should disable Basic Auth in Microsoft 365, block the IP addresses listed in the report, enable CAPs to restrict login attempts and use MFA on all accounts.\nRelated Articles:\nHackers use FastHTTP in new high-speed Microsoft 365 password attacks\nMassive brute force attack uses 2.8 million IPs to target VPN devices\nHackers spoof Microsoft ADFS login pages to steal credentials\nMicrosoft MFA outage blocking access to Microsoft 365 apps\nNew Aquabotv3 botnet malware targets Mitel command injection flaw"

The transfer was part of a scheduled move of ETH from our ETH Multisig Cold Wallet to our Hot Wallet,\"\nBybit explained\nin a post-mortem published on Friday.\n\"Unfortunately, the transaction was manipulated by a sophisticated attack that altered the smart contract logic and masked the signing interface, enabling the attacker to gain control of the ETH Cold Wallet.

It is very popular among developers, businesses, and casual users who need Windows applications on their Macs without rebooting.\nSecurity researcher Mickey Jin published the exploits last week, demonstrating a¬†bypass of the vendor's fixes for\nCVE-2024-34331\n, a privilege elevation flaw fixed in September.\nThat flaw, first discovered in May 2024\nby Mykola Grymalyuk\n, stemmed¬†from a lack of code signature verification in Parallels Desktop for Mac.\nJin says he released the exploits for the zero-day patch bypass after the developer allegedly left it unfixed for over seven months.\n\"Given that the vendor has left this vulnerability unaddressed for over seven months‚Äîdespite prior disclosure‚ÄîI have chosen to publicly disclose this 0-day exploit,\" explains Jin in a\ntechnical writeup\n.\n\"My goal is to raise awareness and urge users to mitigate risks proactively, as attackers could leverage this flaw in the wild.\"\nBypassing Parallels' fix\nParallels' original patch attempted to prevent untrusted code execution by verifying whether the 'createinstallmedia' tool is Apple-signed before granting it root privileges.\nHowever, Jin¬†demonstrated that this verification is flawed, allowing attackers to bypass it in at least two ways.\nThe first is to perform a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) attack to exploit a race condition between checking if 'createinstallmedia' is Apple-signed and executing it with root privileges.\nAn attacker drops a fake macOS installer, waits for Parallels to verify the Apple-signed 'createinstallmedia' binary, and then quickly replaces it with a malicious script before execution, gaining root privileges.\nThe second exploit is an attack via the 'do_repack_manual' function that is vulnerable to arbitrary root-own file overwrites.\nBy manipulating the 'do_repack_manual' function, an attacker redirects a privileged folder using symlinks, tricks Parallels into writing attacker-controlled files to a root-owned path, and replaces 'p7z_tool,' which gets executed as root.\nStatus of patches\nJin discovered the potential bypasses soon after reading Mykola's writeup and informed Parallels¬†in June 2024.\nThe researcher says the vendor promised to look into his report, but despite three subsequent requests for an update (the last one was on February 19, 2025), Parallels didn't respond.\nThe researcher warns that his first exploit, involving the TOCTOU attack, works on the latest version of Parallels, 20.2.1 (55876), and all versions from 19.4.0 and older.\nParallels modified the repacking process in version 19.4.1, switching from 'do_repack_createinstallmedia' to 'do_repack_manual,' breaking the exploit.\nHowever, this change introduced a new vulnerability that allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary root-owned files, making the second exploit possible.\nThe changes were reverted in the latest version (20.2.1), so the exploit is now working again.\nIn conclusion, all known versions of Parallels Desktop, including the latest, are vulnerable to at least one exploit.\nBleepingComputer has contacted Parallels requesting a comment on Jin's findings and report, but a statement wasn't immediately available.\nRelated Articles:\nHackers exploit authentication bypass in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS\nSonicWall firewall exploit lets hackers hijack VPN sessions, patch now\nZyxel won‚Äôt patch newly exploited flaws in end-of-life routers\nGoogle fixes Android kernel zero-day exploited in attacks\nHackers get $886,250 for 49 zero-days at Pwn2Own Automotive 2025"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nThe question is whether Majorana 1 advances progress toward quantum computing ‚Äì or for security professionals, the arrival of computers powerful enough to break PKE.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nMicrosoft has announced the world‚Äôs first quantum processing unit that uses topological qubits: the Majorana 1, ‚Äúdesigned to scale to a million qubits on a single chip‚Äù. This is an amazing technical achievement ‚Äì but does it change the timeline for quantum computer development?\nThe promise and threat of quantum computing\nThe potential power of quantum computing is difficult to imagine, but it will revolutionize society and science. It will help produce new medicines, provide more productive farming, and develop new materials ‚Äì potentially solving many of humanity‚Äôs current intractable concerns.\n\n\n\nWhen combined with AI, each technology will help improve the other. So, at some point, advances in AI and quantum computing will become better and faster ‚Äì the combination will become a continuing and accelerating virtuous cycle. But before the major promise of quantum will come the first known cyber threat: the ability to decrypt the PKE that makes computing and the internet workable.\n\n\n\nThe attraction of topological qubits\nThe primary attraction of topological qubits for the development of quantum computers is the probability of increased resistance to environmentally induced errors.¬†\n\n\n\nThe more common approach to developing quantum computers is to use superconducting or trapped ion qubits; but these qubits are highly sensitive to environmental noise. Put simply, such qubits can easily lose their quantum state and introduce errors ‚Äì a process known as decoherence. Correcting these errors requires the addition of many more error correcting qubits to produce one workable logical qubit.\n\n\n\nTopological qubits attempt to solve this problem by encoding information in the topology of a physical system rather than the state of individual particles. In theory, this makes each qubit far more fault tolerant, meaning that fewer are required to produce a general purpose quantum computer.\n\n\n\nSee Quantum Decryption Brought Closer by Topological Qubits for more information.\n\n\n\nMajorana 1: the technology\n‚ÄúThis architecture is the dark horse the quantum community has been rooting for. Microsoft has been working on this for nearly two decades. The announcement is one of the biggest quantum breakthroughs of the decade,‚Äù says Rebecca Krauthamer, co-founder and CEO at QuSecure.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n‚ÄúPerhaps the biggest challenge in scaling quantum computing is making qubits stable enough to perform complex calculations with high fidelity,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äôs Topological qubit inherently minimizes instability, helping pave the way for truly scalable quantum computers that can tackle real-world challenges.‚Äù\n\n\n\nTechnically, the Majorana 1 stems from Microsoft‚Äôs fabrication of gate-defined devices that combine indium arsenide (a semiconductor), and aluminum (a superconductor) cooled to near absolute zero and tuned with magnetic fields producing topological superconducting nanowires with Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) at the wires‚Äô ends.¬†\n\n\n\nThat, of course, is just the beginning. But Microsoft describes the end result as a ‚Äòtopoconductor‚Äô, a transistor for the quantum age. It also says it ‚Äúoffers a clear path to fit a million qubits on a single chip that can fit in the palm of one‚Äôs hand‚Äù. It claims to now have a roadmap to effective fault tolerant quantum computation.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúWhatever you‚Äôre doing in the quantum space needs to have a path to a million qubits. If it doesn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre going to hit a wall before you get to the scale at which you can solve the really important problems that motivate us,‚Äù explains Chetan Nayak, technical fellow and corporate VP of quantum hardware at Microsoft.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äôs latest announcement marks a breakthrough in bringing the reality of a one-million-qubit quantum computer closer than ever,‚Äù comments Carl Froggett, CIO and CISO at Deep Instinct. ‚ÄúIt accelerates the collision between quantum computing and AI in ways that will disrupt if not completely upend, traditional computing and cybersecurity.‚Äù\n\n\n\nJason Soroko, Senior Fellow at Sectigo, adds, ‚ÄúThe new architecture uses a breakthrough material capable of producing topological qubits. The topoconductor is used to create and control Majorana particles, which in turn form highly stable and scalable qubits.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIain Beveridge, senior product and solutions manager at Entrust, agrees. ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äôs announcement represents a ringing endorsement from an industry giant for what many organizations have already been saying: Quantum computing is coming, and sooner than people think.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis is a huge technical achievement; but the important question for security professionals is whether it shortens the timeline to meaningful quantum computers able to decrypt PKE; that is, a cryptanalytically-relevant quantum computer (CRQC).\n\n\n\nMajorana 1: the implications for cybersecurity and decryption\n‚ÄúThe Majorana 1 is definitely a major breakthrough and provides another alternative method of building qubits, with the primary two being superconducting qubits and trapped ion qubits,‚Äù confirms Troy Nelson, CTO at Lastwall. ‚ÄúThe topoconductor used in the Majorana 1, if proven economically viable and capable of reaching economies of scale, could rival the silicon transistor, which revolutionized computing as we know it.‚Äù\n\n\n\nNotice that ‚Äòif‚Äô. It‚Äôs a big ‚Äòif‚Äô. This Majorana 1 announcement is just one step along a complex path to a functioning quantum computer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an incredible start, but there‚Äôs still a road ahead. Scaling from proof of viability to a full-blown commercial system is no small feat‚Äîthey‚Äôll need to prove reliability at scale. Error correction will be another factor; even stable qubits need backup. And then there‚Äôs the practical side‚Äîbuilding the infrastructure to make this commercially ready,‚Äù warns Krauthamer.\n\n\n\nBut she adds, ‚ÄúIf Microsoft can demonstrate scalability, they could accelerate the timeline significantly. A less noisy qubit means you need fewer physical qubits to get to CRQC. A quantum computer that can break classical encryption is not a distant ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô. Microsoft is talking about commercial quantum machines in five years, and this scalable qubit design is the stepping stone.‚Äù\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Duncan Jones, head of cybersecurity at Quantinuum (a firm immersed in topological qubits) adds, ‚ÄúTimelines are hard to judge but progress across all modalities is so rapid right now that you would not bet against the time to CRQCs shrinking even further in the years ahead.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIn general, there is huge praise for Microsoft‚Äôs topological technology, but less certainty on whether it might bring quantum computing closer. The CEO and founder at Atom Computing, Benjamin Bloom, comments, ‚ÄúI think this is huge progress in topological-quantum-computing, I just don‚Äôt know if that relates to progress in Quantum Computing or not. Only time and more demonstrations will tell.‚Äù\n\n\n\nPerhaps the closest we come to an opinion on whether Majorana 1 brings a CRQC any nearer can be found in a blog from Scott Aaronson, professor of computer science at the University of Texas in Austin. ‚ÄúIf Microsoft‚Äôs claim stands, then topological qubits have finally reached some sort of parity with where more traditional qubits were 20-30 years ago. I.e., the non-topological approaches like superconducting, trapped-ion, and neutral-atom have an absolutely massive head start,‚Äù he wrote.\n\n\n\nHe continued, ‚ÄúTopological qubits can win if, and only if, they turn out to be so much more reliable that they leapfrog the earlier approaches ‚Äì sort of like the transistor did to the vacuum tube and electromechanical relay. Whether that will happen is still an open question, to put it extremely mildly.‚Äù\n\n\n\nMajorana 1: what it means for PQC migration\nMicrosoft believes the Majorana 1 could lead to a fault-tolerant prototype ‚Äúin years not decades‚Äù. The unspoken implication here is ‚Äò5 to 10‚Äô years. Many believe it will be nearer five than ten. Strangely, that doesn‚Äôt make the migration to PQC any more urgent ‚Äì it is already critical.\n\n\n\nPhil Venables, VP at Google and CISO at Google Cloud, explains this in a LinkedIn post dated February 22. ‚ÄúQuantum computing is advancing rapidly. Innovations from Google, Microsoft, IBM and others are pushing the boundaries of not just the numbers of qubits but also their quality. We are well on our way to quantum computing being practical for real world problems.‚Äù\n\n\n\nHe suggests that assuming quantum will arrive at some point between 2032 and 2040, we have a seven year breathing space (note that some pundits believe quantum could arrive in just five years).\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIf we are to be pessimistic (or optimistic depending on your use case) we have seven years to deal with this [that is, migration to PQC]. That‚Äôs a relatively long time, so why worry about this now?‚Äù\n\n\n\nHe continued, ‚ÄúThe migration will take time and will be more complex than people think. Even though 7 ‚Äì 10 years sounds a long time away, in reality the extent of the work needed might mean you are already too late.‚Äù\n\n\n\nMarc Manzano, general manager for cybersecurity at SandboxAQ, sums up: ‚ÄúAs we approach the ‚Äòquantum cliff‚Äô, organizations must identify and secure cryptographic assets before scalable quantum machines break today‚Äôs encryption. The window for migration is shrinking, and a reactive approach is not an option,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äôs progress is a clear signal: the time to act is now.‚Äù\n\n\n\nMicrosoft‚Äôs Majorana 1 does not itself increase the urgency to migrate to PQC and crypto agility, because that urgency is already critical.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Quantum and the Threat to Encryption\nRelated: Google‚Äôs Willow Chip Signals the Urgency of Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration\nRelated: QuSecure Banks $28M Series A for Post-Quantum Cryptography Tech\nRelated: PQC Standards Officially Announced by NIST ‚Äì a History and Explanation\nRelated: Microsoft Adds Support for Post-Quantum Algorithms in SymCrypt Library\n\nThe potential power of quantum computing is difficult to imagine, but it will revolutionize society and science.
