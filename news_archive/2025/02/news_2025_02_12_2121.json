        "Content": "Threat actors have been observed leveraging Google Tag Manager (GTM) to deliver credit card skimmer malware targeting Magento-based e-commerce websites.\nWebsite security company Sucuri\nsaid\nthe code, while appearing to be a typical GTM and Google Analytics script used for website analytics and advertising purposes, contains an obfuscated backdoor capable of providing attackers with persistent access.\nAs of writing, as many as\nthree sites\nhave been found to be infected with the GTM identifier (GTM-MLHK2N68) in question, down from six reported by Sucuri. GTM identifier refers to a\ncontainer\nthat includes the various tracking codes (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel) and rules to be triggered when certain conditions are met.\nFurther analysis has revealed that the malware is being loaded from the Magento database table \"cms_block.content,\" with the GTM tag containing an encoded JavaScript payload that acts as a credit card skimmer.\n\"This script was designed to collect sensitive data entered by users during the checkout process and send it to a remote server controlled by the attackers,\" security researcher Puja Srivastava said.\nUpon execution, the malware is designed to pilfer credit card information from the checkout pages and send it to an external server.\nThis is not the first time GTM has been abused for malicious purposes. In April 2018, Sucuri\nrevealed\nthat the tool was being leveraged for a malvertising campaign with an aim to generate revenue for the operators through pop-ups and redirects.\nThe development comes weeks after the company\ndetailed\nanother WordPress campaign that likely employed vulnerabilities in plugins or compromised admin accounts to install malware that redirected site visitors to malicious URLs.\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) also\nannounced\ncharges against two Romanian nationals, Andrei Fagaras and Tamas Kolozsvari, over their alleged role in a payment card skimming operation.\nThey have been indicted on three counts of access device fraud for possessing skimmers at three different locations in the Eastern District of Louisiana.\nIf convicted, they face up to 15 years imprisonment, up to three years of supervised release, a fine of up to $250,000, and a mandatory special assessment fee of $100, as to each count.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "In cybersecurity, the smallest crack can lead to the biggest breaches. A leaked encryption key, an unpatched software bug, or an abandoned cloud storage bucket—each one seems minor until it becomes the entry point for an attack.\nThis week, we've seen cybercriminals turn overlooked weaknesses into major security threats, proving once again that no system is too small to be targeted. The question isn't whether attackers will find a way in—it's whether you'll be prepared when they do.\nLet's break down what you need to know.\n⚡ Threat of the Week\nMicrosoft Warns of Attacks Exploiting ASP.NET Machine Keys\n— Threat actors are\nexploiting\npublicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys to inject and execute malicious code responsible for launching the Godzilla post-exploitation framework. Microsoft said it has identified over 3,000 publicly disclosed keys that could be used for these types of attacks dubbed ViewState code injection. The company also said it removed key-related artifacts from \"limited instances\" where they were included in its documentation.\nNew AI Report: DeepSeek Surges, Security Risks Persist\nWiz Research just found a major AI security exposure—DeepSeek had a publicly accessible database leaking sensitive information. The issue has been fixed, but it highlights the growing security risks in AI adoption. The State of AI in the Cloud 2025 report – just updated with the latest data, breaks it all down.\nGet the Report\n🔔 Top News\nMultiple Security Flaws Come Under Exploitation\n— Malicious actors are exploiting recently disclosed security flaws in\nSimpleHelp\nremote desktop software (CVE-2024-57726, CVE-2024-57727, and CVE-2024-57728) as part of a suspected ransomware attack. Separately, Russian cybercrime groups have been found to exploit a flaw affecting the\n7-Zip\narchiver tool (CVE-2025-0411) to evade mark-of-the-web (MotW) protections on Windows systems and deliver the SmokeLoader malware as part of attacks aimed at Ukrainian entities. Lastly, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned that a security flaw impacting\nTrimble Cityworks\nGIS-centric asset management software (CVE-2025-0994) has come under active exploitation in the wild.\nRansomware Payments Drop to $813.5M in 2024\n— Ransomware attacks earned cybercrime groups\n$813.5 million in 2024\n, marking a significant drop from $1.25 billion in 2023. That said, 2024 also witnessed the highest volume of annual ransomware cases since 2021, reaching a staggering 5,263 attacks, an increase of 15% year-over-year. The decline is attributed to the growing law enforcement success in dismantling ransomware gangs, heightened global awareness about the threat, and a fragmented ecosystem where lone wolf actors are known to seek smaller ransom payments.\nLazarus's Job-Themed Campaign Delivers JavaScript Malware\n— The Lazarus Group of North Korea has been\nlinked\nto an active campaign that leverages fake LinkedIn job offers in the cryptocurrency and travel sectors to deliver malware capable of infecting Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Bitdefender, which identified the activity, said it likely falls under the Contagious Interview cluster, although the JavaScript malware used in the attacks is different from BeaverTail samples used in the latter.\nSparkCat Uses Android and iOS Apps to Steal Data\n— A new malware campaign dubbed\nSparkCat\nhas leveraged a suite of bogus apps on both Apple's and Google's respective app stores to steal victims' mnemonic phrases associated with cryptocurrency wallets. The development marks one of the first instances where a stealer with optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities has been discovered in the Apple App Store. The offending apps have since been removed from both the app storefronts.\nKyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan Orgs Targeted by Silent Lynx\n— A never-before-seen hacking group tracked as\nSilent Lynx\nhas targeted embassies, lawyers, government-backed banks, and think tanks located in Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan to deploy a PowerShell script that uses Telegram for command-and-control. The activity, attributed to a Kazakhstan-origin threat actor with a medium level of confidence, shares tactical overlaps with another hacking group name YoroTrooper (aka SturgeonPhisher), which has been linked to attacks targeting the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries using PowerShell and Golang tools.\n‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs\nYour go-to software could be hiding dangerous security flaws—don’t wait until it’s too late! Update now and stay ahead of the threats before they catch you off guard.\nThis week’s list includes —\nCVE-2025-25064, CVE-2025-25065\n(Zimbra Collaboration),\nCVE-2024-57968, CVE-2025-25181\n(Advantive VeraCore),\nCVE-2025-20124, CVE-2025-20125\n(Cisco Identity Services Engine),\nCVE-2025-23114\n(Veeam Backup),\nCVE-2024-56161\n(AMD),\nCVE-2025-21415\n(Azure AI Face Service),\nCVE-2024-53104\n(Linux Kernel/Android),\nCVE-2022-22706\n(Arm),\nCVE-2025-23369\n(GitHub Enterprise Server),\nPSV-2023-0039\n,\nPSV-2024-0117\n(NETGEAR),\nCVE-2025-24118\n(Apple),\nCVE-2025-24648, CVE-2024-43333\n(Admin and Site Enhancements plugin), and\nCVE-2025-24734\n(Better Find and Replace plugin).\n📰 Around the Cyber World\nBrute-Force Attack Campaign Targets Networking Devices\n— Threat hunters are warning of a large-scale\nbrute force password attack\nusing nearly 2.8 million IP addresses to guess the credentials for a wide range of networking devices, including those from Ivanti, Palo Alto Networks, and SonicWall, per the Shadowserver Foundation. The IP addresses are\nmainly located\nin Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, Iraq, and Morocco, among others. These IP addresses belong to\nIoT devices\nfrom various vendors like MikroTik, Huawei, Cisco, Boa, and ZTE, which are commonly infected by botnet malware.\nRare Wolf Goes After Russia\n— The threat actor known as\nRare Wolf\n(aka Rezet) has been\nlinked\nto a new set of cyber attacks targeting Russian industrial enterprises in January 2025. The attacks involve the use of phishing lures that employ themes related to seminar invitations in order to deliver malware. Russian organizations across various industries have also been targeted by a large-scale campaign designed to propagate\nNOVA stealer\n, a new commercial fork of Snake Keylogger.\nAI Agents Can Become a Vector for Bot-Driven Card Testing Attacks\n— Threat actors are known to use automated bot programs to test pilfered cards on multiple e-commerce websites. Such card testing attacks typically exploit stolen credit card details through small, unnoticed purchases to verify active cards for larger fraud. \"This entire operation is highly automated, making it challenging for fraud detection systems to catch these fraudulent transactions in real time,\" Group-IB\nsaid\n. \"By the time the actual cardholder notices unusual activity, fraudsters may have already validated multiple cards, and used them for larger unauthorized transactions.\" With the advent of AI agents to perform web-based tasks on behalf of users, the company said the tools present new risks for the banking industry, allowing for automation of card testing and fraud operations at scale.\nAbandoned AWS S3 Buckets Can Be Repurposed for Supply Chain Attacks\n— New research has found that it's possible to register abandoned Amazon S3 buckets in order to stage supply chain attacks at scale. watchTowr Labs said it discovered about 150 Amazon S3 buckets that had previously been used across commercial and open-source software products, governments, and infrastructure deployment/update pipelines. It then re-registered them for a mere $420.85 with the same names. Over a period of two months, the cybersecurity company said the buckets in question received more than 8 million HTTP requests for software updates, JavaScript files, virtual machine images, pre-compiled binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and SSL-VPN configurations, among others. This also meant that a threat actor in possession of these buckets could have responded to the requests with a nefarious software update, CloudFormation templates that grant unauthorized access to an AWS environment, and malicious executables. These networks, watchTowr said, originated from the government networks of the U.S., the U.K., Poland, Australia, South Korea, Turkey, Taiwan, and Chile; military networks, Fortune 500 companies, instant messaging platforms, and universities. The findings once again highlight the security risk associated with abandoned or expired infrastructure, and how source code references to non-existent cloud assets can have serious supply chain ramifications. \"We believe that in the wrong hands, the research we have performed could have led to supply chain attacks that out-scaled and out-impacted anything we as an industry have seen so far – or put more clearly, we would've embarrassed Cozy Bear and made their\nSolarWinds adventures\nlook amateurish and insignificant,\" the company\nsaid\n.\nFive Eyes Nations Release Guidance for Edge Devices\n— Five Eyes cybersecurity agencies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S., along with Czechia and Japan, have\nreleased\njoint guidance\nfor network edge devices, urging device manufacturers to improve forensic visibility by integrating secure-by-default logging to help defenders detect attacks and investigate incidents. Organizations are also recommended to follow vendor hardening guides, subscribe to vendor notifications and advisories, keep devices always updated, enable centralized logging, enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA), disable unused functionality, maintain detailed device inventories, track configuration changes, detect hardware changes, review security policies, implement role-based access control, and include edge device compromise in their incident response plans. The development comes as edge appliances are increasingly becoming a lucrative target for gaining access to target environments.\nU.K. Reportedly Asks for Backdoor Access to Apple iCloud Data\n— Security officials in the U.K. are said to have ordered Apple to create a backdoor to access any Apple user's iCloud content. The demand, first\nreported\nby The Washington Post, \"requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies.\" The order is said to have been issued by the U.K. Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), also nicknamed the Snoopers' Charter. In response, Apple is expected to stop offering encrypted storage, specifically\nAdvanced Data Protection\n, in the U.K. Neither the company nor U.K. government officials have formally commented on the matter. In a statement\nshared\nwith BBC, Privacy International called the move an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals, and that it \"sets a hugely damaging precedent.\" While Apple offers\ntwo levels of encryption\nfor the cloud – Standard data protection and Advanced Data Protection – the former encrypts iCloud data and stores the encryption keys in its own data centers. Furthermore, only certain categories of data, such as health data and passwords, are end-to-end encrypted. Advanced Data Protection, in contrast, is an opt-in feature that provides end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for iCloud backups. Security services and lawmakers have consistently\npushed back against\nthe growing use of end-to-end encryption services, arguing that they could deter efforts to combat serious crime such as terrorism and child sexual abuse, as well as help criminals conceal illicit activity.\n\"Dangerous Hacker\" Arrested in Spain\n— Spanish law enforcement authorities have\nannounced\nthe arrest of an individual suspected of conducting cyber attacks against dozens of organizations. The unnamed man was arrested in the town of Calpe in Spain's Alicante province for allegedly carrying out attacks on more than 40 organizations and leaking stolen data under the alias \"natohub.\" This included NATO, the United Nations, the U.S. Army, and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). He is also accused of targeting organizations in Spain, including the country's mint, universities, government entities, and law enforcement agencies. \"The suspect, who had extensive knowledge of computers, had managed to set up a complex technological network through the use of anonymous messaging and browsing applications, through which he had managed to hide his tracks and thus make his identification difficult,\" the National Police said.\n🎥 Expert Webinar\nFrom Code to Runtime: See How ASPM Transforms Application Protection\n— Join our next webinar with Amir Kaushansky of Palo Alto Networks and discover how ASPM transforms app security. Learn to unify code insights with runtime data, close security gaps, and shift from reactive fixes to proactive defense. Empower your team with smarter, holistic protection against modern threats.\nFrom Debt to Defense: How to Spot and Fix Identity Gaps\n— Join this free webinar and learn how to close identity gaps and fortify your defenses. Experts Karl Henrik Smith and Adam Boucher will reveal how Okta's Secure Identity Assessment streamlines processes, prioritizes critical fixes, and future-proofs your identity strategy to reduce risks and optimize resources.\nP.S. Know someone who could use these? Share it.\n🔧 Cybersecurity Tools\nBaitRoute\n(Honeypot)\n— It is a tool that creates fake vulnerable web endpoints to catch hackers in the act. When an attacker tries to exploit these decoy sites, you'll get an instant alert with details like their IP address and request info. It's easy to integrate with your existing projects using Go, Python, or JavaScript, and it comes with ready-to-use rules so you can start protecting your site right away.\nVolatility Workbench\n— It is a free, open-source GUI for memory forensics that speeds up analysis and cuts out command-line hassles. It auto-detects systems, saves settings, and supports Windows, Mac, and Linux, making digital investigations simpler and faster.\n🔒 Tip of the Week\nKeep Your AI Interactions Private & Secure\n— AI tools like chatbots and voice assistants collect and store your data, which can be hacked, misused, or even influence your decisions. Avoid sharing personal details (passwords, finances, or sensitive info) in AI chats. Turn off unnecessary permissions (like mic or camera access) when not needed. Use AI services that allow data deletion and opt out of tracking when possible. Always fact-check AI responses before trusting them. Your data is valuable—don't give away more than necessary.\nConclusion\nThis week's developments prove once again that cybersecurity is not a one-time fix but an ongoing battle. Whether it's closing loopholes, staying ahead of emerging threats, or adapting to new attack strategies, the key to resilience is vigilance.\nKeep patching, keep questioning, and keep learning.

        "Content": "Given Okta's role as a critical part of identity infrastructure, strengthening Okta security is essential. This article covers six key Okta security settings that provide a strong starting point, along with recommendations for implementing continuous monitoring of your Okta security posture.\nWith over 18,000 customers, Okta serves as the cornerstone of identity governance and security for organizations worldwide. However, this prominence has made it a prime target for cybercriminals who seek access to valuable corporate identities, applications, and sensitive data. Recently, Okta warned its customers of\nan increase in phishing social engineering attempts\nto impersonate Okta support personnel.\nGiven Okta's role as a critical part of identity infrastructure,\nstrengthening Okta security\nis essential. This article covers six key Okta security settings that provide a strong starting point, along with how continuous monitoring of your Okta security posture helps you avoid misconfigurations and identity risks.\nLet's examine six essential Okta security configurations that every security practitioner should monitor:\n1. Password Policies\nStrong password policies are foundational to any\nidentity security posture\nprogram. Okta allows administrators to enforce robust password requirements including:\nMinimum length and complexity requirements\nPassword history and age restrictions\nCommon password checks to prevent easily guessable passwords\nTo configure password requirements in Okta: Navigate to Security > Authentication > Password Settings in the Okta Admin Console.\n2. Phishing-Resistant 2FA Enforcement\nWith phishing attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated, implementing phishing-resistant two-factor authentication on Okta accounts is crucial, especially for privileged admin accounts. Okta supports various strong authentication methods including:\nWebAuthn/FIDO2 security keys\nBiometric authentication\nOkta Verify with device trust\nTo configure MFA factors: Go to Security > Multifactor > Factor Enrollment > Edit > Set factor to required, optional, or disabled.\nAlso, to enforce MFA for all admin console users, refer to\nthis Okta help doc.\n3. Okta ThreatInsight\nOkta ThreatInsight leverages machine learning to detect and block suspicious authentication attempts. This feature:\nIdentifies and blocks malicious IP addresses\nPrevents credential stuffing attacks\nReduces the risk of account takeovers\nTo configure: Enable ThreatInsight under Security > General > Okta ThreatInsight settings. For more, refer to\nthis Okta help doc.\n4. Admin Session ASN Binding\nThis security feature helps prevent session hijacking by binding administrative sessions to specific Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs). When enabled:\nAdmin sessions are tied to the original ASN used during authentication\nSession attempts from different ASNs are blocked\nRisk of unauthorized admin access is significantly reduced\nTo configure: Access Security > General > Admin Session Settings and enable ASN Binding.\n5. Session Lifetime Settings\nProperly configured session lifetimes help minimize the risk of unauthorized access through abandoned or hijacked sessions. Consider implementing:\nShort session timeouts for highly privileged accounts\nMaximum session lengths based on risk level\nAutomatic session termination after periods of inactivity\nTo configure: Navigate to Security > Authentication > Session Settings to adjust session lifetime parameters.\n6. Behavior Rules\nOkta behavior rules provide an extra layer of security by:\nDetecting anomalous user behavior patterns\nTriggering additional authentication steps when suspicious activity is detected\nAllowing customized responses to potential security threats\nTo configure: Access Security > Behavior Detection Rules to set up and customize behavior-based security policies.\nHow SSPM (SaaS Security Posture Management) can help\nOkta offers HealthInsight which provides security monitoring and posture recommendations to help customers maintain strong Okta security. But, maintaining optimal security across your entire SaaS infrastructure—including Okta—becomes increasingly complex as your organization grows. This is where\nSaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM)\nsolutions provide significant value:\nContinuous centralized monitoring of security configurations for critical SaaS apps like Okta to detect misalignments and drift away from security best practices\nAutomated assessment of user privileges and access patterns to identify potential security risks\nDetection of app-to-app integrations like marketplace apps, API keys, service accounts, OAuth grants, and other non-human identities with access to critical SaaS apps and data\nReal-time alerts for security configuration changes that could impact your organization's security posture\nStreamlined compliance reporting and documentation of security controls\nSSPM solutions\ncan automatically detect common Okta security misconfigurations such as:\nWeak password policies that don't meet industry standards\nDisabled or improperly configured multi-factor authentication settings\nExcessive administrative privileges or unused admin accounts\nMisconfigured session timeout settings that could leave accounts vulnerable\nBy implementing a robust\nSaaS security and governance solution\nwith advanced SSPM capabilities, organizations can maintain continuous visibility into their Okta security posture as well as other critical SaaS infrastructure and quickly remediate any issues that arise. This proactive approach to security helps prevent potential breaches before they occur and ensures that security configurations remain optimized over time.\nStart a free 14-day trial of Nudge Security\nto start improving your Okta security posture and your overall SaaS security posture today.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Threat actors have been observed targeting Internet Information Services (IIS) servers in Asia as part of a search engine optimization (SEO) manipulation campaign designed to install BadIIS malware.\n\"It is likely that the campaign is financially motivated since redirecting users to illegal gambling websites shows that attackers deploy BadIIS for profit,\" Trend Micro researchers Ted Lee and Lenart Bermejo\nsaid\nin an analysis published last week,\nTargets of the campaign include IIS servers located in India, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil. These servers are associated with government, universities, technology companies, and telecommunications sectors.\nRequests to the compromised servers can then be served altered content from attackers, ranging from redirections to gambling sites to connecting to rogue servers that host malware or credential harvesting pages.\nIt's suspected that the activity is the work of a Chinese-speaking threat group known as\nDragonRank\n, which was documented by Cisco Talos last year as delivering the BadIIS malware via SEO manipulation schemes.\nThe DragonRank campaign, in turn, is said to be associated with an entity referred to as\nGroup 9\nby ESET in 2021 that leverages compromised IIS servers for proxy services and SEO fraud.\nTrend Micro, however, noted that the detected malware artifacts share similarities with a variant used by Group 11, featuring two different modes for conducting SEO fraud and injecting suspicious JavaScript code into responses for requests from legitimate visitors.\n\"The installed BadIIS can alter the HTTP response header information requested from the web server,\" the researchers said. \"It checks the 'User-Agent' and 'Referer' fields in the received HTTP header.\"\n\"If these fields contain specific search portal sites or keywords, BadIIS redirects the user to a page associated with an online illegal gambling site instead of a legitimate web page.\"\nThe development comes as Silent Push linked the China-based Funnull content delivery network (CDN) to a practice it calls infrastructure laundering, in which threat actors rent IP addresses from mainstream hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure and use them to host criminal websites.\nFunnull is said to have rented over 1,200 IPs from Amazon and nearly 200 IPs from Microsoft, all of which have since been taken down. The malicious infrastructure, dubbed\nTriad Nexus\n, has been found to fuel retail phishing schemes, romance baiting scams, and money laundering operations via fake gambling sites.\n\"But new IPs are continually being acquired every few weeks,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"Funnull is likely using fraudulent or stolen accounts to acquire these IPs to map to their CNAMEs.\"\nFound this article interesting?

While the number of ransomware events increased in the second half of 2024, on-chain payments declined, suggesting that even though more victims were targeted, fewer actually paid the ransom. In some cases, those who paid managed to successfully negotiate the ransom amount to a much smaller amount.\nVictims organizations have wrestled with the pay-or-not-pay dilemma for years. On one hand, paying may be the only answer when there is no other way to recover the data or the downtime waiting to recover the data is too long. On the other hand, paying rewards criminal activity, funds future activities, and may encourage more attacks against the victim. Improved cyber hygiene and overall resiliency is helping organizations make the decision to not pay, according to Christian Geyer, founder and CEO of Actfore. Better incident-response capabilities, digital forensics, and data-mining services are helping victims identify breached data faster.\n\"Organizations have increasingly implemented comprehensive data backup solutions, so the business can rapidly recover their systems through a wipe-and-restore process,\" Geyer said. \nAnother reason is that law enforcement actions are making an impact on the ransomware ecosystem. Several ransomware groups that were prolific in 2023 and the first half of 2024 were not as active in the second half of the year. LockBit is one such case. The UK's National Crime Agency, the US FBI, and law enforcement entities in Canada, Japan, and Australia collaborated in Operation Cronos to seize data and websites associated with LockBit in February 2024. That disruption seemed particularly effective; payments to the criminals behind LockBit decreased by 79% in the second half of 2024. Similarly, ALPHV/BlackCat's going dark in March 2024 after collecting $22 million from Change Healthcare left \"a void\" in the second half of 2024, Chainalysis said.\nWhen a large group leaves the cybercrime ecosystem — either after a law enforcement disruption or voluntarily shutting down operations — there usually is a slight dip in activity and then another group ramps up activities to fill the void. That doesn't seem to have happened in 2024, Lizzie Cookson, a senior director of incident response at Coveware, told Chainalysis.\n\"We saw a rise in lone actors, but we did not see any group(s) swiftly absorb their market share. … The current ransomware ecosystem is infused with a lot of newcomers who tend to focus efforts on the small to midsize markets, which in turn are associated with more modest ransom demands,\" she said.\nEdge Editors\nDark Reading\nThe Edge is Dark Reading's home for features, threat data and in-depth perspectives on cybersecurity.\nYou May Also Like\nUncovering Threats to Your Mainframe & How to Keep Host Access Secure\nSecuring the Remote Workforce\nEmerging Technologies and Their Impact on CISO Strategies\nHow CISOs Navigate the Regulatory and Compliance Maze\nWhere Does Outsourcing Make Sense for Your Organization?\n[Conference] Black Hat USA - August 2-7 - Learn More\n[Conference] Black Hat Asia - April 1-4 - Learn More\n[Dark Reading Virtual Event] Cybersecurity's Most Promising New and Emerging Technologies\nGartner: Most Security Leaders Cannot Balance Data Security, Business Goals\nCybercrime Forces Local Law Enforcement to Shift Focus\nHow Are Modern Fraud Groups Using GenAI and Deepfakes?\nInteractive Online Training for Cybersecurity Professionals; Earn CPE Credits\nCopyright © 2025.

The group first surfaced in 2013, and through at least late 2024 was known primarily for leveraging Web vulnerabilities to deploy malware for skimming credit card numbers and associated data from e-commerce sites.\nIn June 2023, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) identified XE Group as one of several threat actors exploiting vulnerabilities in Progress Telerik software running on government IIS servers and executing remote commands on them. One of the vulnerabilities that CISA identified in its report (CVE-2017-9248) was the same one that Malwarebytes first observed XE Group exploiting back in 2020 in card skimmer attacks targeting ASP.Net sites. That campaign, as Intezer and Solis noted in their report, was notable for its focus on ASP.Net sites, which were rarely targeted at the time. In 2023, Menlo Security reported seeing XE Group deploying multiple strategies, including supply chain attacks to deploy card skimmers on websites, and also setting up fake sites for stealing personal information and selling it in underground forums.\nWhat Solis and Intezer have observed now is a continued expansion of the threat actor's activities, exploitation techniques, and malware since then. The group's newer attack tactics include injecting malicious JavaScript into webpages, exploiting vulnerabilities in widely deployed products, and using custom ASPX Web shells to maintain access to compromised system.\nIn several of the recent attacks, the threat actor has used the two VeraCore zero-days (CVE-2024-57968, an upload validation vulnerability with a CVSS severity score of 9.9; and CVE-2025-25181, a SQL injection flaw with a 5.8 severity score) to deploy multiple Web shells on compromised systems.\n\"In at least one instance, Solis and Intezer researchers discovered the threat actor had exploited one of the VeraCore vulnerabilities as far back as January 2020 and had maintained persistent access to the victim's compromised environment since then,\" according to the joint report. \"In 2024, the group reactivated a webshell initially deployed [in January 2020], highlighting their ability to remain undetected and reengage targets. Their ability to maintain persistent access to systems … years after initial deployment, highlights the group’s commitment to long-term objectives.\"\nThe XE Group's recent shift in tactics and targeting are consistent with a broader focus among threat actors on the software supply chain. Though SolarWinds remains perhaps the best known example, there have been several other significant attacks on widely used software products and services. Examples include attacks on Progress Software's MOVEit file transfer tool, a breach at Okta that affected all of its customers, and a breach at Accellion that allowed attackers to deploy ransomware on some of the company's customers.\nJai Vijayan, Contributing Writer\n\nJai Vijayan is a seasoned technology reporter with over 20 years of experience in IT trade journalism.

Council was arrested on October 17, 2024, in connection with his role in a conspiracy to hack into the X account of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and publish fraudulent posts in the name of the then-SEC Chairman. \nThe plea was announced by U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., Supervisory Official Antoinette T. Bacon of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey and FBI Special Agent in Charge Sean Ryan of the Washington Field Office, Criminal and Cyber Division.\nCouncil’s plea was entered before U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson in the District of Columbia. He faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and up to three years of supervised release. His sentencing is scheduled for May 16, 2025.\nAccording to court documents, from at least January 2024, Council conspired with others to carry out Subscriber Identity Model (SIM) attacks, commonly referred to as “SIM swaps,” in exchange for money. \nA SIM card is a chip that stores information identifying and authenticating a cell phone subscriber and connects a physical cell phone to a mobile carrier’s cellular and data network. A SIM swap attack is a form of sophisticated fraud where criminal actors fraudulently induce a mobile carrier to reassign a mobile phone number from a victim’s SIM card to a SIM card and telephone controlled by a criminal actor attempting to access valuable information associated with the victim’s telephone. Members of SIM swapping groups conduct SIM swaps for the purpose of defeating multifactor authentication and/or two-step verification security features for internet connected accounts, such as social media and virtual currency accounts. \nAfter convincing a mobile carrier to reassign a phone number to a new SIM card in the criminal actor’s control, members of the conspiracy generate password reset security authentication codes for online accounts and those codes are in turn sent to the telephone in the control of the criminal actor. Members of SIM swap groups share the security reset codes with one another to unlawfully access a victim’s internet connected accounts and complete the fraud. \nOn or about January 9, 2024, Council, and others, executed a SIM swap of the mobile phone account associated with the @SECgov X account, the official account of the SEC. The purpose of this SIM swap was to gain unauthorized access to this government account in order to make fraudulent posts. \nBefore January 9, a member of the conspiracy had identified the authorized user for the phone number linked to the official @SECgov X account. Council received instruction from a co-conspirator to perform the SIM swap on this phone line, along with information to make the needed fake ID, that is, an image of an ID card template with the authorized user’s name on it but Council’s face, and information purporting to be the user’s date of birth and social security number. \nCouncil used his portable ID card printer to create a physical ID which he used to impersonate the victim at an AT&T store in Huntsville, Alabama. Council provided false information to the AT&T store employee to explain why he needed a replacement SIM card. Council obtained the SIM card linked to the victim’s phone line and walked to a nearby Apple store where he purchased a new iPhone to use in the crime.  He inserted the SIM card to activate the phone, received the @SECGov X password reset codes on this new phone linked to the victim’s SIM card and used his personal cell phone to take a photo of the @SECgov X account reset code to share with his co-conspirators. After passing along the password reset codes, Council drove to Birmingham, Alabama and immediately returned the iPhone for cash.   \nA member of the conspiracy used the reset code to gain access to the @SECGov X account and issue a fraudulent post in the name of the then-SEC Chairman, falsely announcing SEC approval of Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The price of BTC increased by more than $1,000 following the post. Shortly after this unauthorized post, the SEC regained control over their X account and confirmed that the announcement was unauthorized and the result of a security breach, which caused the value of BTC decreased by more than $2,000.\nCouncil also admitted to attempting to perform additional SIM swaps in June 2024 in Alabama. In June 2024, the FBI executed a search warrant at an Athens, Alabama, apartment where he resided. Agents recovered a fake identification card and a portable ID card printer. They also recovered a laptop computer.  \nPursuant to the search warrant, agents searched the laptop and discovered templates for additional fake identification cards stored on the laptop along with internet searches for\n“SECGOV hack,” “telegram sim swap,” “how can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI,” “What are the signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement or the FBI even if you have not been contacted by them,” “what are some signs that the FBI is after you,” “Verizon store list,” “federal identity theft statute,” and “how long does it take to delete telegram account.” \nCouncil admitted to receiving approximately $50,000 from members of the conspiracy to perform SIM swap during the previous six months.   \nThis case is being investigated by the FBI Washington Field Office Criminal and Cyber Division, the SEC-Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Fraud Section’s Market Integrity and Major Frauds Unit of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. Significant assistance was provided by the FBI’s Birmingham Field Office.\nThe prosecution is being handled by Assistant United States Attorney Kevin Rosenberg, CCIPS Trial Attorney Ashley Pungello, and Fraud Section Trial Attorney Lauren Archer. Valuable assistance was provided by Assistant United States Attorney John Hundscheid from the Northern District of Alabama.\nFor more information on SIM swapping, go to: https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA240411\nYou May Also Like\nUncovering Threats to Your Mainframe & How to Keep Host Access Secure\nSecuring the Remote Workforce\nEmerging Technologies and Their Impact on CISO Strategies\nHow CISOs Navigate the Regulatory and Compliance Maze\nWhere Does Outsourcing Make Sense for Your Organization?\n[Conference] Black Hat USA - August 2-7 - Learn More\n[Conference] Black Hat Asia - April 1-4 - Learn More\n[Dark Reading Virtual Event] Cybersecurity's Most Promising New and Emerging Technologies\nThe State of Firewall Security: Challenges, Risks, and Solutions for Modern Networks\nIndustrial Networks in the Age of Digitalization\nZero-Trust Adoption Driven by Data Protection, Cloud Access Control, and Regulatory Compliance Requirements\nThreat Hunting's Evolution: From On-Premises to the Cloud\nHow Enterprises Secure Their Applications\nUncovering Threats to Your Mainframe & How to Keep Host Access Secure\nSecuring the Remote Workforce\nEmerging Technologies and Their Impact on CISO Strategies\nHow CISOs Navigate the Regulatory and Compliance Maze\nWhere Does Outsourcing Make Sense for Your Organization?\nThe State of Cloud Native Security Report 2024\nDelivering Globally Consistent App Performance to the Hybrid Workforce\nThe State of Firewall Security: Challenges, Risks, and Solutions for Modern Networks\nSocial Engineering: New Tricks, New Threats, New Defenses\nUnderstanding Social Engineering Attacks and What To Do About Them\n[Conference] Black Hat USA - August 2-7 - Learn More\n[Conference] Black Hat Asia - April 1-4 - Learn More\n[Dark Reading Virtual Event] Cybersecurity's Most Promising New and Emerging Technologies\nCopyright © 2025.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nAttackers are smuggling payment card-skimming malicious code into checkout pages on Magento-based e-commerce sites by abusing the Google Tag Manager ad tool.\nFebruary 10, 2025\nAttackers are exploiting Google Tag Manager by planting malicious code within e-commerce sites built on the Magento platform. The code can steal payment card data, demonstrating a new type of Magecart attack that leverages Google's free, legitimate website marketing tool.\nResearchers from Sucuri discovered an ongoing Magecart campaign in which attackers load code that appears to be a standard Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics tracking script from a database onto e-commerce sites. These tracking scripts are typically used for website analytics and advertising purposes; however, the code used in the campaign has been tweaked to act as a card skimmer for the infected site, the researchers revealed in a recent blog post.\n\"Within the GTM tag, there was an encoded JavaScript payload that acted as a credit card skimmer,\" Sucuri security analyst Puja Srivastava wrote in the post. \"This script was designed to collect sensitive data entered by users during the checkout process and send it to a remote server controlled by the attackers.\"\nSo far, Sucuri has uncovered at least six sites affected by the campaign, \"indicating that this threat is actively affecting multiple sites,\" Srivastava wrote.\nRelated:Salt Typhoon's Impact on the US & Beyond\nThe attack demonstrates a nontypical Magecart attack that leverages a legitimate free tool from Google that allows website owners to manage and deploy marketing tags on their website without needing to modify the site's code directly. GTM eliminates the need for developer intervention each time a marketer aims to track or modify an ad or marketing campaign.\nSucuri researchers were alerted to the Magecart activity by a customer who found that someone was stealing credit card payment data from its e-commerce site. An investigation led to the discovery of malware being loaded from a database table cms_block.content file for the website. The malware abused a GTM tag, which was altered by embedding an encoded JavaScript payload that acted as a credit card skimmer.\nAttackers obfuscated the script using the technique function _0x5cdc, which maps index values to specific characters in the array. This makes it difficult for someone to immediately understand the purpose of the script, Srivastava wrote.\nThe script also uses a series of mathematical operations in a loop, further scrambling the code, and also uses Base64 encoding. \"This is a trick often used by attackers to disguise the true purpose of the script,\" she wrote.\nThe researchers also discovered an undeployed backdoor in one of the website's files that \"could have been exploited to further infect the site, providing attackers with persistent access,\" Srivastava added. Indeed, Magecart attackers last year demonstrated a new tactic of stashing backdoors on websites to deploy malware automatically.\nRelated:Canadian Man Charged in $65M Cryptocurrency Hacking Schemes\nSucuri also previously investigated malicious activity that abused GTM to hide other types of malicious activity, including malvertising as well as malicious pop-ups and redirects.\n\"Magecart\" refers to a loose collective of cybercriminal groups involved in online payment card-skimming attacks. These attacks typically inject card skimmers into websites to steal payment card data that can later be monetized. Big-name organizations that have been targeted by these attacks include Ticketmaster, British Airways, and the Green Bay Packers NFL team.\nOnce they identified the source of infection on their customer's site, Sucuri researchers removed the malicious code from any other compromised areas of the site, as well as cleaned up the obfuscated script and the backdoor to prevent the malware from being reintroduced.\nTo ensure an organization's e-commerce site has not been affected by the campaign, administrators should log in to GTM, and then identify and delete any suspicious tags that are being used on the site, Sucuri recommended. They also should perform a full website scan to detect any other malware or backdoors, and remove any malicious scripts or backdoor files.\nRelated:Behavioral Analytics in Cybersecurity: Who Benefits Most?\nE-commerce sites built on Magento and their extensions also should be updated with the latest security patches, while all site administrators should regularly monitor e-commerce site traffic as well as GTM activity for anything unusual.\n\nElizabeth Montalbano, Contributing Writer\n\nElizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer, journalist, and therapeutic writing mentor with more than 25 years of professional experience.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nFor too long, we've treated our analysts as mere cogs in a machine, expecting them to conform to the limitations of our tools and processes. It's time to revolutionize security operations.\nFebruary 10, 2025\nCOMMENTARY\nIn the battle against cyber threats, we're losing our most vital asset: our people. While the industry fixates on the latest tools and technologies, security analysts are burning out, crushed under the weight of an impossible mission. This isn't just a talent shortage, but an existential crisis threatening the future of cybersecurity defense. Until we prioritize supporting the humans at the heart of cyber operations, no tool or technology will be enough to keep us secure.\nSecurity operations centers (SOCs), the heart of cybersecurity, have become pressure cookers of burnout and frustration. The numbers tell a dire story: More than half of SOC analysts have considered leaving the field, and with them goes the institutional knowledge and expertise that take years to develop. Each departure is a victory for malicious actors, who know that even the most sophisticated tools are only as effective as the humans behind them.\nThere's a tendency to frame this simply as a talent shortage. In one sense, it is. 53% of organizations report a critical lack of skilled cybersecurity workers. But this misses the direness of the current reality. We can't hire our way out of this disaster. It takes years to develop an analyst capable of detecting and responding to sophisticated threats. By the time junior analysts gain the expertise to handle advanced attacks, they're already burning out and searching for greener pastures. Cyber defenders need relief now.\nThe crisis extends beyond front-line defenders. Nearly a quarter of chief information security officers (CISOs) and IT security leaders are considering stepping down, with 93% citing unsustainable stress levels. They face mounting pressure to demonstrate return on investment (ROI) while navigating increasing legal and compliance risks, and even personal liability. It's no wonder the average tenure of a CISO is only 18 to 26 months — less than half of the general C-suite tenure.\nSomehow, we've normalized this chaos. In any other critical operation, like the military, this level of systemic burnout would be considered an existential risk. Instead, we keep piling on more tools, more alerts, and more responsibilities, mistaking the symptoms for the disease.\nOur industry has a blind spot. We've focused so much on software and hardware that we've forgotten about the \"humanware\" of security workflows. We've overlooked the frontline analysts, the threat hunters, and the managers whose judgment and intellectual horsepower are the real engine of modern security operations.\nThis matters so deeply to me on a personal level. In my Air Force career, I was a special operations helicopter pilot. Picture it: skimming treetops under night vision goggles, working with elite teams, pushing the boundaries of what seemed possible. Despite the intense pressure and risk, I never once thought about walking away. Why? Because I had cutting-edge equipment, unwavering support from my leadership, and a mission that made my heart race. I would have done it for free.\nToday, cyber defenders are the pilots of the 21st century. It's the coolest job on the planet: battling sophisticated adversaries in real-time, protecting the critical infrastructure that powers our economy, and racing against the clock to stop attacks that could affect millions. They should be having the time of their lives. Instead, they're burning out.\nThe answer isn't just better technology — it's about fundamentally reshaping how we support our people. The industry talks constantly about analysts learning from AI, but we're missing something crucial: the AI must learn from our analysts as well. Their expertise, their pattern recognition, their hard-won instincts about what doesn't look quite right; this human judgment is irreplaceable. We need to give our humans AI partners that learn from them, support them, freeing them to focus on the high-level, intellectually stimulating work that drew them to cybersecurity in the first place.\nImagine SOCs where analysts focus on outsmarting adversaries instead of drowning in false positives. Where AI handles the repetitive tasks but learns from human insights, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement. Where the technology amplifies human expertise instead of trying to replace it. Where the job is as exhilarating as flying a combat mission, because you have tools that learn and evolve alongside you. (In a recent episode of CSO Perspectives, I go into depth of what that looks like.)\nFor too long, we've treated our analysts as mere cogs in a machine, expecting them to conform to the limitations of our tools and processes.\nIt's time to revolutionize security operations. When we get this right, we won't just solve our retention crisis. We'll create a field that the best and brightest are eager to join, where analysts don't just survive, but thrive in the mission of keeping us all safe. The future of cybersecurity belongs not to those who build better tools, but to those who best empower defenders to wield them.\nRead more about:\nWilliam MacMillan\nChief Product Officer, Andesite\nWilliam MacMillan, Chief Product Officer at Andesite, is an experienced executive leader, advisor and trusted voice on cyber, digital transformation and national security.

With a career dedicated to understanding the intersection of technology and human potential, Mr. Lawrence explores how intelligent systems can complement, rather than replace, human capabilities. At the heart of his talk is the notion of the “atomic human” – a philosophical and technical perspective on what distinguishes us from machines.\nIndeed, Mr. Lawrence goes on to examine how technological breakthroughs have forced us to reconsider the traits we hold as inherently human. Each time a machine did something we thought was uniquely human, it cut something away from us. And as this process continues, is there a final frontier – a moment where machines can no longer cut something away from us and take away our capabilities? And if we find what that moment is, does it tell us something about the essence of humanity?\nBy drawing parallels between AI’s rapid evolution and some of history’s greatest human achievements – from the Apollo missions to Amelia Earhart’s daring flights – Mr. Lawrence illustrates how technology has been a tool to augment human ingenuity, not a force to erase it. With AI reaching further into areas once thought unreachable, the challenge lies in ensuring that we shape it as a tool for empowerment, rather than let it redefine our identity.\n\n\n      Sign up for our newsletters\n    \nWe Live Science\nRoeland Nusselder: AI will eat all our energy, unless we make it tiny | Starmus highlights\nWe Live Science\nRoeland Nusselder: AI will eat all our energy, unless we make it tiny | Starmus highlights\n\nWe Live Science\nBrian Greene: Until the end of time | Starmus highlights\nWe Live Science\nBrian Greene: Until the end of time | Starmus highlights\n\nWe Live Science\nGary Marcus: Taming Silicon Valley | Starmus highlights\nWe Live Science\nGary Marcus: Taming Silicon Valley | Starmus highlights\n\nWe Live Science\nGary Marcus: Taming Silicon Valley | Starmus highlights\nWe Live Science\nRoeland Nusselder: AI will eat all our energy, unless we make it tiny | Starmus highlights\nWe Live Science\nPhilip Torr: AI to the people | Starmus highlights\n\n            Award-winning news, views, and insight from the ESET security community\n          "
