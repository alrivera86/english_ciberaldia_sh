A patch for the flaw was addressed in the Linux kernel in December 2024. It was subsequently addressed in Android earlier this month.\nIt's believed that CVE-2024-53104 was combined with two other flaws – CVE-2024-53197 and CVE-2024-50302 – both of which have been resolved in the Linux kernel. They are yet to be included in an Android Security Bulletin.\nCVE-2024-53197\n(CVSS score: N/A) - An out-of-bounds access vulnerability for Extigy and Mbox devices\nCVE-2024-50302\n(CVSS score: 5.5) - A use of an uninitialized resource vulnerability that could be used to leak kernel memory\n\"The exploit, which targeted Linux kernel USB drivers, enabled Cellebrite customers with physical access to a locked Android device to bypass an Android phone's lock screen and gain privileged access on the device,\" Amnesty said.\n\"This case highlights how real-world attackers are exploiting Android's USB attack surface, taking advantage of the broad range of legacy USB kernel drivers supported in the Linux kernel.\"\nThe activist, who has been given the name \"Vedran\" to protect their privacy, was taken to a police station and his phone confiscated on December 25, 2024, after he attended a student protest in Belgrade.\nAmnesty's analysis found that the exploit was used to unlock his Samsung Galaxy A32 and that the authorities attempted to install an unknown Android application. While the exact nature of the Android app remains unclear, the modus operandi is consistent with that of prior\nNoviSpy spyware\ninfections reported in mid-December 2024.\nEarlier this week, Cellebrite\nsaid\nits tools are not designed to facilitate any type of offensive cyber activity and that it works actively to curtail the misuse of its technology.\nThe Israeli company also said it will no longer allow Serbia to use its software, stating \"we found it appropriate to stop the use of our products by the relevant customers at this time.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is an amazing technology developed by Microsoft that lets you access and control another computer over a network. It's like having your office computer with you wherever you go. For businesses, this means IT staff can manage systems remotely, and employees can work from home or anywhere, making RDP a true game-changer in today's work environment.\nBut here's the catch: because RDP is accessible over the internet, it's also a prime target for unethical hackers. If someone gains unauthorized access, they could potentially take over your system. That's why it's so important to secure RDP properly.\nWhy IT Teams Depend on RDP, Despite the Risks\nMore than 50 percent of Kaseya's small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) customers use RDP for daily operations due to its efficiency and flexibility:\nReduces Costs and Downtime\n– IT teams can resolve technical issues remotely, eliminating travel expenses and delays.\nSupports Business Continuity\n– Employees and administrators can securely access company systems from any location.\nEnables Scalable IT Management\n– MSPs can oversee multiple client networks from a single interface.\nDespite its benefits, RDP's widespread use makes it an attractive attack vector, requiring constant vigilance to secure properly.\nNew Concerns: The Rise of Port 1098 Scans\nTypically, RDP communicates over port 3389. However, recent security reports - like one from the\nShadowserver Foundation\nin December 2024 - have highlighted a worrying trend. Hackers are now scanning port 1098, an alternative route that many aren't as familiar with, to find vulnerable RDP systems.\nTo put this into perspective, honeypot sensors have observed up to 740,000 different IP addresses scanning for RDP services every day, with a significant number of these scans coming from a single country. Attackers use these scans to locate systems that may be misconfigured, weak, or unprotected, and then they can try to force their way in by guessing passwords or exploiting other weaknesses.\nFor businesses, especially SMBs and MSPs, this means a higher risk of serious issues like data breaches, ransomware infections, or unexpected downtime.\nKeeping Up with Security Patches\nMicrosoft is aware of these risks and regularly releases updates to fix security vulnerabilities. In December 2024, for example, Microsoft addressed nine major vulnerabilities related to Windows Remote Desktop Services. These fixes targeted a range of issues identified by security experts, ensuring that known weaknesses couldn't be easily exploited.\nThen, in January's update, two additional critical vulnerabilities (labeled\nCVE-2025-21309\nand\nCVE-2025-21297\n) were patched. Both of these vulnerabilities, if left unaddressed, could allow attackers to remotely execute harmful code on a system without the need for passwords.\nHow Kaseya's vPenTest Proactively Helps Secure RDP & More\nRDP exposed to the internet is more often a misconfiguration than an intended configuration. In the last 28,729 external network pentests we have performed, we were able to find 368 instances of RDP exposed to the public internet. On internal networks we have found 490 instances of Bluekeep.\nFor organizations looking for a proactive method to protect their external and internal networks, tools like\nvPenTest\nare invaluable. vPenTest offers:\nAutomated Network Pentesting:\nThe platform will perform both external and internal network pentests. IT Professionals are now able to perform the same attacks as an attacker against the networks they manage to proactively protect them and test security controls.\nMulti-Tenant:\nThe platform is purpose built for the multi-functional IT Team juggling multiple tasks. IT Professionals are able to manage all pentest engagements for multiple companies within the platform.\nDetailed Reporting and Dashboard:\nvPenTest will generate a set of reports including an Executive Summary and a very detailed Technical Report. The platform also has a dashboard for each assessment so IT Professionals can quickly review findings, recommendations and affected systems.\nFor the first time in tech history, IT Professionals are now able to execute a real network pentest against the organizations they manage at scale and on a more frequent basis.\nHow Datto EDR Helps Secure RDP\nFor organizations looking for an extra layer of protection, tools like Datto Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) are invaluable. Datto EDR offers:\nReal-Time Threat Detection:\nIt monitors RDP traffic for unusual behavior—like unexpected access attempts or strange port usage—and raises alerts if something seems off.\nAutomated Responses:\nWhen suspicious activity is detected, the system can automatically block or isolate the threat, stopping potential breaches in their tracks.\nDetailed Reporting:\nComprehensive logs and reports help administrators understand what happened during an incident, so they can strengthen their defenses for the future.\nThis means that with Datto EDR, businesses can enjoy the benefits of RDP while keeping their systems safer from modern threats.\nPractical Tips to Lock Down RDP\nHere are some straightforward tips to help secure your RDP setup:\nTimely Patching:\nAlways install updates as soon as they're available. Vendors frequently release patches to address new vulnerabilities.\nLimit Exposure:\nRestrict RDP access to trusted personnel only and consider changing the default port (3389) to something less predictable.\nUse Multi-Factor Authentication:\nAdding extra steps for verification (like MFA and Network Level Authentication) makes it much harder for attackers to gain access.\nEnforce Strong Passwords:\nEnsure that passwords are complex and meet a minimum length requirement to help thwart brute-force attacks.\nBy taking these steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of your RDP services becoming an entry point for cyberattacks.\nRDP Isn't Going Away—But Security Needs to Improve\nRDP is an essential tool that has transformed how businesses operate, enabling remote work and efficient system management. However, as with any powerful tool, it comes with its own set of risks. With attackers now exploring new avenues like port 1098 and continuously finding ways to exploit vulnerabilities, it's crucial to stay on top of security updates and best practices.\nBy keeping your systems patched, limiting access, using multi-factor authentication, and employing advanced security solutions like Datto EDR, you can enjoy the flexibility of RDP without compromising your organization's security.\nStay safe and stay updated!\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

Alternatively, those distributing Lumma Stealer contain images to download the document that, when clicked, takes the victim to a malicious site.\nFor its part, the site masquerades as a fake CAPTCHA verification page that employs the\nClickFix technique\nto deceive the victim into running an MSHTA command that executes the stealer malware by means of a PowerShell script.\nIn recent weeks, Lumma Stealer has also been\ndisguised\nas Roblox games and a cracked version of the Total Commander tool for Windows, highlighting the myriad delivery mechanisms adopted by various threat actors. Users are redirected to these websites through YouTube videos likely uploaded from previously compromised accounts.\n\"Malicious links and infected files are often disguised in [YouTube videos, comments, or descriptions,\" Silent Push\nsaid\n. \"Exercising caution and being skeptical of unverified sources when interacting with YouTube content, especially when prompted to download or click on links, can help protect against these growing threats.\"\nThe cybersecurity company further found that Lumma Stealer logs are being shared for free on a relatively new hacking forum called Leaky[.]pro that went operational in late December 2024.\nLumma Stealer is a\nfully-featured crimeware solution\nthat's offered for sale under the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model, giving a way to harvest a wide range of information from compromised Windows hosts. In early 2024, the malware operators announced an integration with a Golang-based proxy malware named GhostSocks.\n\"The addition of a SOCKS5 backconnect feature to existing Lumma infections, or any malware for that matter, is highly lucrative for threat actors,\" Infrawatch\nsaid\n.\n\"By leveraging victims' internet connections, attackers can bypass geographic restrictions and IP-based integrity checks, particularly those enforced by financial institutions and other high-value targets. This capability significantly increases the probability of success for unauthorized access attempts using credentials harvested via infostealer logs, further enhancing the post-exploitation value of Lumma infections.\"\nThe disclosures come as stealer malware like\nVidar\nand Atomic macOS Stealer (\nAMOS\n) are being distributed using the ClickFix method via lures for the DeepSeek artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, according to\nZscaler ThreatLabz\nand\neSentire\n.\nPhishing attacks have also been spotted abusing a JavaScript obfuscation method that uses invisible Unicode characters to represent binary values, a technique that was\nfirst documented\nin October 2024.\nThe approach entails making use of Unicode filler characters, specifically Hangul half-width (U+FFA0) and Hangul full-width (U+3164), to represent the binary values 0 and 1, respectively, and converting each ASCII character in the JavaScript payload to their Hangul equivalents.\n\"The attacks were highly personalized, including non-public information, and the initial JavaScript would try to invoke a debugger breakpoint if it were being analyzed, detect a delay, and then abort the attack by redirecting to a benign website,\" Juniper Threat Labs\nsaid\n.\nFound this article interesting?

The massive dataset contains over 250 billion pages spanning 18 years.\nThe archive specifically contains 400TB of compressed web data, 90,000 WARC files (Web ARChive format), and data from 47.5 million hosts across 38.3 million registered domains.\nThe company's analysis found that there are 219 different secret types in Common Crawl, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) root keys, Slack webhooks, and Mailchimp API keys.\n\"'Live' secrets are API keys, passwords, and other credentials that successfully authenticate with their respective services,\" security researcher Joe Leon\nsaid\n.\n\"LLMs can't distinguish between valid and invalid secrets during training, so both contribute equally to providing insecure code examples. This means even invalid or example secrets in the training data could reinforce insecure coding practices.\"\nThe disclosure follows a warning from Lasso Security that data exposed via public source code repositories can be accessible via AI chatbots like Microsoft Copilot even after they have been made private by taking advantage of the fact that they are indexed and cached by Bing.\nThe attack method, dubbed Wayback Copilot, has uncovered 20,580 such GitHub repositories belonging to 16,290 organizations, including Microsoft, Google, Intel, Huawei, Paypal, IBM, and Tencent, among others.

Last month, cybersecurity company F6 (formerly F.A.C.C.T.)\ndescribed\nit as a \"pro-Ukrainian cyberspy group.\"\nThe attackers have been found to mainly single out organizations in Russia and Belarus, with hundreds of victims identified in the former.\nPrevious\nintrusion\nactivities\nassociated with the group have leveraged phishing emails as a conduit to distribute various malware families such as NetWire, Rhadamanthys, Ozone RAT, and a backdoor known as DarkTrack, the last of which is launched via a loader called\nAnde Loader\n.\nThe attack sequence involves the use of spear-phishing emails bearing a booby-trapped attachment (e.g., archive files), within which are two Windows shortcut (LNK) files and a legitimate lure document.\nThe archive files are responsible for advancing the malicious activity to the next-stage, unleashing a complex multi-stage process to deploy the Lumma information stealer.\n\"This implant was created using the legitimate open-source installer, Nullsoft Scriptable Install System, and functions as a self-extracting archive (SFX),\" Kaspersky said.\nThe attacks have been observed incorporating steps to evade detection by security vendors by means of a check for emulators and sandboxed environments, causing the malware to either terminate or resume after a 10,000 ms delay, a technique also spotted in Awaken Likho implants.\nThis overlap has raised the possibility that the attackers behind the two campaigns share the same technology or likely the same group using a different set of tools for different targets and tasks.\nLumma Stealer is designed to gather system and installed software information from compromised devices, as well as sensitive data such as cookies, usernames, passwords, banking card numbers, and connection logs. It's also capable of stealing data from various web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, cryptowallet browser extensions (MetaMask), authenticators, and from apps AnyDesk and KeePass.\n\"The group's latest attacks use the Lumma stealer, which collects a vast amount of data from infected devices, including browser-stored banking details and cryptowallet files,\" Kaspersky said.\n\"The group relies on readily available malicious utilities obtained from darknet forums, rather than developing its own tools.

        "Content": "Law enforcement agencies from 19 countries have arrested 25 suspects linked to a criminal ring that was distributing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) generated using artificial intelligence (AI).\nOperation Cumberland, coordinated by Danish law enforcement and supported by Europol, resulted in the seizure of 173 electronic devices and the identification of 273 suspected members tied to the criminal network.\nMost individuals arrested during this joint action were apprehended on February 26, 2025, following 33 house searches around the world.\nIn November 2024, authorities arrested the main suspect, a Danish national, for distributing AI-generated content created through an online platform. Those who wanted to use the suspects' service could obtain a password to access the platform after making a symbolic online payment to watch AI-generated content featuring children being abused.\n\"These artificially generated images are so easily created that they can be produced by individuals with criminal intent, even without substantial technical knowledge,\"\nsaid\nCatherine De Bolle, Europol's Executive Director. \"This contributes to the growing prevalence of child sexual abuse material, and as the volume increases, it becomes progressively more challenging for investigators to identify offenders or victims.\"\nEuropol has established and led the\nStop Child Abuse – Trace An Object initiative\nsince 2017, enabling people to provide information that can help cases of child sexual abuse by recognizing objects linked to the investigations.\nThe initiative helped identify 30 victims until November 2023, allowing law enforcement agents to arrest six offenders, who were prosecuted based on information provided by almost 28,000 tips.\nAustralian Federal Police also\nlaunched its own version\nof the Stop Child Abuse initiative in March 2021, focusing on the Asia Pacific region.\n\"Europol and its partners will launch an online campaign in the coming days highlighting the consequences of using AI for illegal purposes and targeting potential offenders where they are most active: online,\" Europol added on Friday. \"The campaign will use online messages to reach buyers of illegal content, as well as other methods such as knock-and-talks, social media messages and warning letters.\"\nThis week, Microsoft also\nnamed multiple threat actors\nlinked to a global cybercrime gang (tracked as Storm-2139), who are accused of creating malicious tools designed to bypass generative AI guardrails to generate illicit content including celebrity deepfakes.\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft names cybercriminals behind AI deepfake network\nSuspected Desorden hacker arrested for breaching 90 organizations\nSocial media is stealing your time—Zario Pro helps you get your focus back\nPolice arrests 2 Phobos ransomware suspects, seizes 8Base sites\nWriting, image creation, PDFs, and more in one AI platform in this deal"

        "Content": "Serbian authorities have reportedly used an Android zero-day exploit chain developed by Cellebrite to unlock the device of a student activist in the country and attempt to install spyware.\nCellebrite is an Israeli digital forensics company that develops tools used by law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and private companies to extract data from smartphones and other digital devices.\nCompanies like Cellebrite commonly utilize zero-day exploits to access and extract data usually protected on locked phones.\nThe use of this Android exploit was found by Amnesty International's\nSecurity Lab\nin mid-2024 during forensic research on the logs of the impacted device.\nThe organization\npreviously reported\non cases of privacy rights abuse in Serbia in December 2024. In response to the revelations,\nCellebrite announced\nit blocked access to its tools for the country's security services (BIA) earlier this week.\nAfter Amnesty shared its findings with Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), Google's researchers were able to pinpoint three vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel USB drivers, also used in Android, that were exploited as zero-days.\nThe three flaws are:\nCVE-2024-53104\n(USB Video Class exploit)\nCVE-2024-53197\n(ALSA USB-sound driver exploit)\nCVE-2024-50302\n(USB HID device exploit)\nThe first flaw was patched in Google's\nFebruary 2025 Android security updates\n, marked as \"under limited, targeted exploitation.\"\nThe other two flaws have not been announced as fixed in any Android security update bulletins yet, and depending on the device model and how often manufacturers update its kernel, it might take a while.\nHead of Security Lab at Amnesty, Donncha O'Cearbhaill, told BleepingComputer that patching CVE-2024-53104 might be enough to disrupt the whole exploitation chain, although they cannot be certain about it yet.\nGrapheneOS told BleepingComputer that their Android distribution already has patches for CVE-2024-53197 and CVE-2024-50302 because they regularly update the latest Linux kernel.\nGoogle told BleepingComputer after publication that they shared fixes for these flaws with OEM partners on January 18th.\n\"We were aware of these vulnerabilities and exploitation risk prior to these reports and promptly developed fixes for Android. Fixes were shared with OEM partners in a partner advisory on January 18, a Google spokesperson told BleepingComputer.\n\"These CVEs will also be included in future Android Security Bulletins and required by Android Security Patch Level (SPL). As a best security practice, we always advise users to update their devices as soon as security patches or software updates become available.\"\nUSB drivers under fire\nUSB exploits commonly take advantage of vulnerabilities in a device's USB system, such as the drivers, firmware, or kernel components, to gain unauthorized access or control over the system.\nThe exploit may achieve memory corruption for arbitrary code execution, inject malicious commands, or bypass lock screens.\nOne mitigating factor is that they require physical access to the target device. In this case, and many\nother similar cases\n, this requirement was easily fulfilled by the police detaining the person and confiscating their device.\nIn April 2024, Google\nfixed two zero-day flaws\n(CVE-2024-29745 and CVE-2024-29748) forensic firms exploited to unlock phones without a PIN, implementing memory zeroing before USB is enabled.\nEarlier this month, Apple\nfixed a zero day\n(CVE-2025-24200) Cellebrite and GrayKey leveraged for bypassing USB Restricted Mode to extract data from iPhones.\nStock Android does not have a direct equivalent to Apple's USB Restricted Mode. However, users can still mitigate the threat by turning off USB debugging (ADB), setting the cable connectivity mode to \"Charge Only,\" and enabling Full Disk Encryption (Settings → Security & privacy → More security & privacy → Encryption & credentials → Encrypt phone).\nRelated Articles:\nSpyLend Android malware downloaded 100,000 times from Google Play\nGoogle fixes Android kernel zero-day exploited in attacks\nGoogle blocked 2.36 million risky Android apps from Play Store in 2024\nNew Android Identity Check locks settings outside trusted locations\nFortinet discloses second firewall auth bypass patched in January"

        "Date": "2025-02-28",
        "Content": "One of the most notorious providers of abuse-friendly “bulletproof” web hosting for cybercriminals has started routing its operations through networks run by the Russian antivirus and security firm Kaspersky Lab, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.\nSecurity experts say the Russia-based service provider Prospero OOO (the triple O is the Russian version of “LLC”) has long been a persistent source of malicious software, botnet controllers, and a torrent of phishing websites. Last year, the French security firm Intrinsec detailed Prospero’s connections to bulletproof services advertised on Russian cybercrime forums under the names Securehost and BEARHOST.\nThe bulletproof hosting provider BEARHOST. This screenshot has been machine-translated from Russian. Image: Ke-la.com.\nBulletproof hosts are so named when they earn or cultivate a reputation for ignoring legal demands and abuse complaints. And BEARHOST has been cultivating its reputation since at least 2019.\n“If you need a server for a botnet, for malware, brute, scan, phishing, fakes and any other tasks, please contact us,” BEARHOST’s ad on one forum advises. “We completely ignore all abuses without exception, including SPAMHAUS and other organizations.”\nIntrinsec found Prospero has courted some of Russia’s nastiest cybercrime groups, hosting control servers for multiple ransomware gangs over the past two years. Intrinsec said its analysis showed Prospero frequently hosts malware operations such as SocGholish and GootLoader, which are spread primarily via fake browser updates on hacked websites and often lay the groundwork for more serious cyber intrusions — including ransomware.\nA fake browser update page pushing mobile malware. Image: Intrinsec.\nBEARHOST prides itself on the ability to evade blocking by Spamhaus, an organization that many Internet service providers around the world rely on to help identify and block sources of malware and spam. Earlier this week, Spamhaus said it noticed that Prospero was suddenly connecting to the Internet by routing through networks operated by Kaspersky Lab in Moscow.\nKaspersky did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\nKaspersky began selling antivirus and security software in the United States in 2005, and the company’s malware researchers have earned accolades from the security community for many important discoveries over the years. But in September 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) barred U.S. federal agencies from using Kaspersky software, mandating its removal within 90 days.\nCybersecurity reporter Kim Zetter notes that DHS didn’t cite any specific justification for its ban in 2017, but media reports quoting anonymous government officials referenced two incidents. Zetter wrote:\nAccording to one story, an NSA contractor developing offensive hacking tools for the spy agency had Kaspersky software installed on his home computer where he was developing the tools, and the software detected the source code as malicious code and extracted it from his computer, as antivirus software is designed to do. A second story claimed that Israeli spies caught Russian government hackers using Kaspersky software to search customer systems for files containing U.S. secrets.\nKaspersky denied that anyone used its software to search for secret information on customer machines and said that the tools on the NSA worker’s machine were detected in the same way that all antivirus software detects files it deems suspicious and then quarantines or extracts them for analysis. Once Kaspersky discovered that the code its antivirus software detected on the NSA worker’s machine were not malicious programs but source code in development by the U.S. government for its hacking operations, CEO Eugene Kaspersky says he ordered workers to delete the code.\nLast year, the U.S. Commerce Department banned the sale of Kaspersky software in the U.S. effective July 20, 2024. U.S. officials argued the ban was needed because Russian law requires domestic companies to cooperate in all official investigations, and thus the Russian government could force Kaspersky to secretly gather intelligence on its behalf.\nPhishing data gathered last year by the Interisle Consulting Group ranked hosting networks by their size and concentration of spambot hosts, and found Prospero had a higher spam score than any other provider by far.\nAS209030, owned by Kaspersky Lab, is providing connectivity to the bulletproof host Prospero (AS200593). Image: cidr-report.org.\nIt remains unclear why Kaspersky is providing transit to Prospero. Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis at Kentik, said routing records show the relationship between Prospero and Kaspersky started at the beginning of December 2024.\nMadory said Kaspersky’s network appears to be hosting several financial institutions, including Russia’s largest — Alfa-Bank. Kaspersky sells services to help protect customers from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and Madory said it could be that Prospero is simply purchasing that protection from Kaspersky.\nBut if that is the case, it doesn’t make the situation any better, said Zach Edwards, a senior threat researcher at the security firm Silent Push.\n“In some ways, providing DDoS protection to a well-known bulletproof hosting provider may be even worse than just allowing them to connect to the rest of the Internet over your infrastructure,” Edwards said.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Friday 28th of February 2025 03:14 PM \r\n         \nI wonder if the financial impact of restrictions on the “legitimate” AV business is a factor in branching out to… less legitimate ways of raising revenue?\nThis is a stupid question, but can’t we just cut Russia off from the public internet?\nImportant reporting.  Is Eugene still at all in effective control of the company, I wonder.  Of course when they force you to do the bidding of the ministry of X, you obviously can’t respond to western journalists seeking comment about it unless you fancy a swift window exit from the building.  It will be interesting to see how this plays out.\nSounds like a “gag order” in the U.S.\nYour email address will not be published.

Two additional security defects — CVE-2024-53197 and CVE-2024-50302 — were also identified and have been patched either in the Linux kernel or through Android security updates.\n\n\n\nIn the incident, Amnesty International said the student activist had his Samsung Galaxy A32 seized during a protest last December. After turning his phone off upon entering a police station, the device was later powered on by plain-clothes officers. \n\n\n\nAmnesty International said detailed logs from the phone confirmed that the Cellebrite system, using a hardware dongle known as Turbo Link, emulated several USB devices to trigger the exploit chain.

The employee downloaded an AI image generation tool containing malware, which allowed hackers to steal credentials from his computer, including ones that enabled access to Disney systems. The hackers stole customer and employee information, as well as corporate documents from the entertainment giant.

This indicates that Lee Enterprises has refused to pay a ransom or negotiations have stalled. \n\n\n\nThe hackers claimed to have obtained 350 Gb of files from Lee Enterprises systems, including “investor records, financial arrangements that raise questions, payments to journalists and publishers, funding for tailored news stories, and approaches to obtaining insider information”.\n\n\n\nThe cybercriminals are threatening to leak the stolen data on March 5 unless a ransom is paid. To demonstrate their claims, they have published samples of the stolen data, including screenshots of passport and driver’s license scans, corporate documents, and spreadsheets. \n\n\n\n\n\nQilin is a Russia-linked ransomware-as-a-service that appears to have been around since October 2022. It has targeted a wide range of organizations, including London hospitals, which were forced to cancel operations and appointments due to the attack. Advertisement.

The actual number of targeted organizations is likely significantly higher considering that many victims decide to pay a ransom — only those that refuse to pay up are named on leak sites. \n\n\n\nRelated: Philadelphia Inquirer Hit by Cyberattack Causing Newspaper’s Largest Disruption in Decades\nRelated: Media Giant News Corp Discloses New Details of Data Breach\nRelated: New York Times Responds to Source Code Leak\n\nThe cyberattack came to light in early February, when the American media company, which owns roughly 350 weekly and specialty publications across 25 states, revealed that the incident had impacted business applications and resulted in operational disruptions. \n\n\n\nThe attack reportedly impacted at least 75 newspapers across the US, including the distribution of print publications and online operations. \n\n\n\nThe company later clarified that the attackers encrypted files and exfiltrated information from its systems, which indicated that it had been targeted in a ransomware attack.\n\n\n\nOn February 27, the Qilin ransomware group announced that it was behind the attack on Lee Enterprises in a post on its Tor-based leak website.

        "Date": "2025-02-28",
        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nThe Vo1d botnet is now powered by 1.6 million Android TV devices, up from 1.3 million half a year ago. \nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nCybercriminals continue to enhance the capabilities of the botnet known as Vo1d, which has grown significantly over the past half a year. \nIn September 2024, Russian security firm Doctor Web warned that 1.3 million Android TV boxes around the world had been ensnared in the Vo1d botnet.\n\n\n\nChinese security company QiAnXin (QAX) has also monitored the threat and on Thursday reported seeing nearly 90 new samples of the malware. Its researchers have observed activity from roughly 800,000 unique IPs associated with the botnet every day, with a peak at nearly 1.6 million on January 14, 2025. \n\n\n\nAccording to QiAnXin, the botnet has evolved in terms of stealth, resilience and anti-detection capabilities. Specifically, the cybercriminals are attempting to prevent command and control (C&C) domain takeover by using RSA encryption to secure communication. \n\n\n\nThe botnet’s resilience and flexibility have been enhanced through the use of hardcoded and DGA-based redirector C&C servers. In an effort to increase the difficulty of analyzing the malware, each payload now uses a unique downloader with XXTEA encryption and RSA-protected keys. \n\n\n\nThe Vo1d botnet has mainly been used for anonymous proxy services and for ad/click fraud. Proxy services can make a lot of money for cybercriminals, as demonstrated by the 911 S5 (Cloud Router) botnet, which helped its operators make $99 million. \n\n\n\nHowever, such a big botnet could be abused for various other purposes as well, including massive DDoS attacks, as well as to broadcast unauthorized content to the large number of infected Android TV boxes.\n\n\n\nNearly a quarter of the Vo1d-infected devices are in Brazil, followed by South Africa (13%), Indonesia (10%), Argentina (5%), Thailand (3%), and China (3%) — infections have been seen across over 200 countries and regions. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nAs for how these Android TV devices are getting infected with the Vo1d malware, researchers believe it’s either through a supply chain attack (the malware is pre-installed by some manufacturers), or due to users failing to secure their devices and installing malicious software disguised as useful apps and tools. \n\n\n\nQiAnXin researchers also reported finding some links to Bigpanzi, another botnet powered by a significant number of Android TV boxes.\n\n\n\nRelated: Botnet of 190,000 BadBox-Infected Android Devices Discovered\nRelated: Chinese Botnet Powered by 130,000 Devices Targets Microsoft 365 Accounts\nRelated: Aquabot Botnet Targeting Vulnerable Mitel Phones\nRelated: Murdoc Botnet Ensnaring Avtech, Huawei Devices\n\nIn September 2024, Russian security firm Doctor Web warned that 1.3 million Android TV boxes around the world had been ensnared in the Vo1d botnet.\n\n\n\nChinese security company QiAnXin (QAX) has also monitored the threat and on Thursday reported seeing nearly 90 new samples of the malware.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nIn a lawsuit targeting cybercriminals who abuse AI services, Microsoft has named individuals from Iran, the UK, China and Vietnam.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nAs part of a lawsuit targeting cybercriminals who abuse AI services, Microsoft has made public the names of four individuals who are allegedly part of a global network tracked as Storm-2139.\nThe lawsuit, filed in December 2024 against what Microsoft described as the ‘Azure Abuse Enterprise’, targets individuals accused of developing and using malicious tools that allow users to bypass the guardrails of gen-AI services and generate deepfakes and other harmful or illegal content. \n\n\n\nAccording to Microsoft, Storm-2139 has targeted services such as its Azure OpenAI Service. The threat actors first obtain exposed credentials found in public sources, which they use to access gen-AI services. The capabilities of the targeted AI services are modified and then sold to others, with instructions on how to generate illicit content. \n\n\n\nMicrosoft’s investigation has revealed three types of actors involved in the Storm-2139 operation: creators, who develop the tools that allow gen-AI abuse; providers, who modify and supply these tools; and users, who use the tools to create deepfakes. According to the tech giant, the generated content is “often centered around celebrities and sexual imagery”.\n\n\n\nThe suspects named by Microsoft in a recent amended complaint are Arian Yadegarnia (Fiz) from Iran, Alan Krysiak (Drago) from the United Kingdom, Ricky Yuen (Cg-dot) from China (Hong Kong), and Phat Phung Tan (Asakuri) from Vietnam.\n\n\n\nThe company has identified over a dozen individuals involved in the operation. Of the named suspects, Cg-dot has been flagged as a creator, while Fiz, Drago, and Asakuri are believed to be providers.\n\n\n\nCreators have been found in the US and China, while providers have been identified in countries such as Iran, Austria, Vietnam, the UK, and the United States. Users have been discovered in the US, UK, Denmark, Russia, Turkey, and South American countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft pointed out that two of the threat actors located in the United States are known — they live in Florida and Illinois — but their identity has not been made public to avoid interference with possible criminal investigations. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“Microsoft is preparing criminal referrals to United States and foreign law enforcement representatives,” Steven Masada, assistant general counsel in Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, said in a blog post on Thursday. \n\n\n\nMicrosoft has managed to shut down a website used in the gen-AI abuse operation. After their site was taken down and the tech giant started releasing details via court documents, some of the threat actors doxed the lawyers, posting their name, personal information and even photos in some cases.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, some of the suspected cybercriminals started revealing members’ real identities, while others contacted Microsoft’s lawyers to pin the blame on specific individuals. \n\n\n\nRelated: 2 Arrested in Takedown of Nulled, Cracked Hacking Forums\nRelated: Identity of Notorious Hacker USDoD Revealed\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in December 2024 against what Microsoft described as the ‘Azure Abuse Enterprise’, targets individuals accused of developing and using malicious tools that allow users to bypass the guardrails of gen-AI services and generate deepfakes and other harmful or illegal content. \n\n\n\nAccording to Microsoft, Storm-2139 has targeted services such as its Azure OpenAI Service.
