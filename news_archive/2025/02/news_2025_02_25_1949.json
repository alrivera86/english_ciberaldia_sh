        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have flagged an updated version of the LightSpy implant that comes equipped with an expanded set of data collection features to extract information from social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram.\nLightSpy is the name given to a\nmodular spyware\nthat's\ncapable\nof infecting both Windows and Apple systems with an aim to harvest data. It was first documented in 2020, targeting users in Hong Kong.\nThis includes Wi-Fi network information, screenshots, location, iCloud Keychain, sound recordings, photos, browser history, contacts, call history, and SMS messages, and data from various apps like Files, LINE, Mail Master, Telegram, Tencent QQ, WeChat, and WhatsApp.\nLate last year, ThreatFabric detailed an updated version of the malware that incorporates destructive capabilities to prevent the compromised device from booting up, alongside expanding the number of supported plugins from 12 to 28.\nPrevious findings have also uncovered potential overlaps between LightSpy and an Android malware named\nDragonEgg\n, highlighting the cross-platform nature of the threat.\nHunt.io's latest analysis of the malicious command-and-control (C2) infrastructure associated with the spyware has uncovered support for over 100 commands spanning Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, routers, and Linux.\n\"The new command list shifts focus from direct data collection to broader operational control, including transmission management ('传输控制') and plugin version tracking ('上传插件版本详细信息'),\" the company\nsaid\n.\n\"These additions suggest a more flexible and adaptable framework, allowing LightSpy operators to manage deployments more efficiently across multiple platforms.\"\nNotable among the new commands is the ability to target Facebook and Instagram application database files for data extraction from Android devices. But in an interesting twist, the threat actors have removed iOS plugins associated with destructive actions on the victim host.\nAlso discovered are 15 Windows-specific plugins designed for system surveillance and data collection, with most of them geared towards keylogging, audio recording, and USB interaction.\nThe threat intelligence firm said it also discovered an endpoint (\"/phone/phoneinfo\") in the admin panel that grants logged-in users the ability to remotely control the infected mobile devices. It's currently not known if these represent new developments or previously undocumented older versions.\n\"The shift from targeting messaging applications to Facebook and Instagram expands LightSpy's ability to collect private messages, contact lists, and account metadata from widely used social platforms,\" Hunt.io said.\n\"Extracting these database files could provide attackers with stored conversations, user connections, and potentially session-related data, increasing surveillance capabilities and opportunities for further exploitation.\"\nThe disclosure comes as Cyfirma disclosed details of an Android malware dubbed SpyLend that masquerades as a financial app named Finance Simplified (APK name \"com.someca.count\") on the Google Play Store but engages in\npredatory lending, blackmail, and extortion\naimed at Indian users.\n\"By leveraging location-based targeting, the app displays a list of unauthorized loan apps that operate entirely within WebView, allowing attackers to bypass Play Store scrutiny,\" the company\nsaid\n.\n\"Once installed, these loan apps harvest sensitive user data, enforce exploitative lending practices, and employ blackmail tactics to extort money.\"\nSome of the advertised loan apps are KreditPro (formerly KreditApple), MoneyAPE, StashFur, Fairbalance, and PokketMe. Users who install Finance Simplified from outside India are served a harmless WebView that lists various calculators for personal finance, accounting, and taxation, suggesting that the campaign is designed to specifically target Indian users.\nThe app is no longer available for download from the official Android app marketplace. According to statistics available on Sensor Tower, the application was\npublished\naround mid-December 2024 and attracted over 100,000 installations.\n\"Initially presented as a harmless finance management application, it downloads a fraud loan app from an external download URL, which once installed, gains extensive permissions to access sensitive data, including files, contacts, call logs, SMS, clipboard content, and even the camera,\" Cyfirma pointed out.\nIndian retail banking customers have also become the target of another campaign that distributes a malware codenamed FinStealer that impersonates legitimate bank apps, but is engineered to collect login credentials and facilitate financial fraud by carrying out unauthorized transactions.\n\"Distributed via phishing links, and social engineering, these fake apps closely mimic legitimate bank apps, tricking users into revealing credentials, financial data, and personal details,\" the company\nsaid\n.\n\"Using Telegram bots, the malware can receive instructions and send stolen data without raising suspicion, making it more difficult for security systems to detect and block the communication.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Opposition activists in Belarus as well as Ukrainian military and government organizations are the target of a new campaign that employs malware-laced Microsoft Excel documents as lures to deliver a new variant of\nPicassoLoader\n.\nThe threat cluster has been assessed to be an extension of a long-running campaign mounted by a Belarus-aligned threat actor dubbed Ghostwriter (aka Moonscape, TA445, UAC-0057, and UNC1151) since 2016. It's\nknown\nto align with Russian security interests and promote narratives critical of NATO.\n\"The campaign has been in preparation since July-August 2024 and entered the active phase in November-December 2024,\" SentinelOne researcher Tom Hegel\nsaid\nin a technical report shared with The Hacker News. \"Recent malware samples and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure activity indicate that the operation remains active in recent days.\"\nThe starting point of the attack chain analyzed by the cybersecurity company is a Google Drive shared document that originated from an account named Vladimir Nikiforech and hosted a RAR archive.\nThe RAT file includes a malicious Excel workbook, which, when opened, triggers the execution of an obfuscated macro when prospective victims enable macros to be run. The macro proceeds to write a DLL file that ultimately paves the way for a simplified version of\nPicassoLoader\n.\nIn the next phase, a decoy Excel file is displayed to the victim, while, in the background, additional payloads are downloaded onto the system. As recently as June 2024, this approach was\nused\nto deliver the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation framework.\nSentinelOne said it also discovered other weaponized Excel documents bearing Ukraine-themed lures to retrieve an unknown second-stage malware from a remote URL (\"sciencealert[.]shop\") in the form of a seemingly harmless JPG image, a technique known as steganography. The URLs are no longer available.\nIn another instance, the booby-trapped Excel document is used to deliver a DLL named LibCMD, which is designed to run cmd.exe and connect to stdin/stdout. It's directly loaded into memory as a .NET assembly and executed.\n\"Throughout 2024, Ghostwriter has repeatedly used a combination of Excel workbooks containing Macropack-obfuscated VBA macros and dropped embedded .NET downloaders obfuscated with\nConfuserEx\n,\" Hegel said.\n\"While Belarus doesn't actively participate in military campaigns in the war in Ukraine, cyber threat actors associated with it appear to have no reservation about conducting cyber espionage operations against Ukrainian targets.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The first quarter of 2025 has been a battlefield in the world of cybersecurity. Cybercriminals continued launching aggressive new campaigns and refining their attack methods.\nBelow is an overview of five notable malware families, accompanied by analyses conducted in controlled environments.\nNetSupport RAT Exploiting the ClickFix Technique\nIn early 2025, threat actors began exploiting a technique known as ClickFix to distribute the NetSupport Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\nThis method involves injecting fake CAPTCHA pages into compromised websites, prompting users to execute malicious PowerShell commands that download and run the NetSupport RAT.\nOnce installed, this RAT grants attackers full control over the victim's system, allowing activities such as real-time screen monitoring, file manipulation, and execution of arbitrary commands.\nMain technical characteristics of NetSupport RAT\nAttackers can view and control the victim's screen in real time.\nUploads, downloads, modifies, and deletes files on the infected system.\nRuns system commands and PowerShell scripts remotely.\nCaptures copied text, including passwords and sensitive data.\nRecords user keystrokes for credential theft.\nStarts, stops, and modifies system processes and services.\nInstalls itself in startup folders, registry keys, or scheduled tasks to survive reboots.\nUses process injection and code obfuscation to evade detection.\nMaintains a stealthy connection with attackers using encrypted traffic.\nAfter running the NetSupport RAT payload inside\nANY.RUN's Interactive Sandbox\n, we can see several activities.\nView NetSupport RAT analysis session\nMalicious archive opened inside ANY.RUN sandbox\nWhen NetSupport RAT infects a system, it immediately establishes a connection with a command-and-control (C2) server, allowing attackers to operate the compromised machine remotely.\nCnC connection detected by ANY.RUN sandbox\nThrough this connection, attackers can execute system commands, deploy additional malware, and modify system settings.\nEquip your team with\nANY.RUN's\nInteractive Sandbox to analyze unlimited malware in real time, uncover threats faster, and strengthen your defenses.\nStart your free trial today!\nNetSupport RAT employs multiple Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to maintain persistence, evade detection, and gather system data. Key TTPs include:\nPersistence & Execution: Modifies registry startup keys, executes scripts via wscript.exe.\nDiscovery: Reads computer name, checks system language, and accesses environment variables.\nDefense Evasion & C2 Communication: Drops legitimate Windows executables, creates internet connection objects for remote control.\nThese techniques demonstrate how NetSupport RAT establishes control while avoiding detection, all of which are visible in ANY.RUN's ATT&CK mapping.\nMain TTPs used by NetSupport RAT\nLynx Ransomware\nThe Lynx Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group is known as a highly organized entity, offering a structured affiliate program and robust encryption methods. Building upon the foundation of the earlier INC ransomware, Lynx has enhanced its capabilities and expanded its reach, targeting a diverse range of industries across multiple countries.\nLynx's affiliate panel allows its affiliates to configure victim profiles, generate custom ransomware samples, and manage data-leak schedules within a user-friendly interface. Because of its structured approach, it becomes one of the most accessible ransomware even for those with limited technical expertise.\nTo incentivize participation, Lynx offers affiliates an 80% share of ransom proceeds. The group maintains a leak site where stolen data is published if victims fail to pay the ransom.\nMajor attacks of Lynx in Q1\nIn the first quarter of 2025, the Lynx Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group has intensified its operations, targeting various industries with sophisticated attacks.\nParticularly, in February 2025, Lynx claimed responsibility for breaching Brown and Hurley, a prominent Australian truck dealership. The group alleged the theft of approximately 170 gigabytes of sensitive data, including human resources documents, business contracts, customer information, and financial records.\nIn January 2025, Lynx also breached Hunter Taubman Fischer & Li LLC, a U.S.-based law firm specializing in corporate and securities law.\nMain technical characteristics of Lynx ransomware\nEncrypts all files by default, including local drives, network shares, and removable media.\nConfigurable via RaaS to target specific file types, folders, or extensions.\nSteals sensitive data before encryption, exfiltrating documents, credentials, and financial information.\nTransfers stolen data over encrypted channels, such as HTTPS or custom communication protocols.\nDeletes Volume Shadow Copies and disables Windows recovery features to prevent restoration.\nCloses applications that may block encryption using RestartManager.\nUtilizes credential dumping techniques to extract stored passwords from browsers, Windows Credential Manager, and networked devices.\nMaintains a C2 connection with DGA-based domains and anonymized traffic via Tor.\nDetects VMs and sandboxes, altering behavior to evade analysis.\nRuns in memory without writing files to disk, avoiding detection.\nWe can observe Lynx Ransomware's behavior firsthand in a controlled environment. In the ANY.RUN sandbox analysis, after executing the Lynx payload, the infected system undergoes several noticeable changes.\nView Lynx ransomware analysis session\nDesktop background changed inside ANY.RUN sandbox\nThe desktop background is replaced with a ransom message, and the attackers leave a note warning that all data has been stolen and encrypted. Victims are instructed to download Tor to contact them.\nRansomware message left by attackers\nThe sandbox also detects how Lynx systematically renames files, appending its extension. For example, C:\\Users\\admin\\Desktop\\academicroad.rtf becomes C:\\Users\\admin\\Desktop\\academicroad.rtf.LYNX.\nFiles renaming with .lynx detected by ANY.RUN\nDozens of files across the system are modified this way, further confirming its encryption process. These are just a few of the many destructive actions Lynx carries out once inside a compromised system.\nModification of files by Lynx ransomware\nAsyncRAT: Leveraging Python Payloads and TryCloudflare Tunnels\nIn early 2025, cybersecurity researchers uncovered a sophisticated malware campaign deploying AsyncRAT, a remote access trojan known for its efficient, asynchronous communication capabilities.\nThis campaign stands out due to its use of Python-based payloads and the exploitation of TryCloudflare tunnels to enhance stealth and persistence.\nInfection Chain Overview\nThe attack initiates with a phishing email containing a Dropbox URL. When recipients click the link, they download a ZIP archive housing an internet shortcut (URL) file.\nThis file, in turn, retrieves a Windows shortcut (LNK) file via a TryCloudflare URL. Executing the LNK file triggers a series of scripts, PowerShell, JavaScript, and batch scripts, that download and execute a Python payload.\nThis payload is responsible for deploying multiple malware families, including AsyncRAT, Venom RAT, and XWorm.\nTechnical Characteristics of AsyncRAT\nAllows attackers to execute commands, monitor user activity, and manage files on the compromised system.\nCapable of stealing sensitive information, including credentials and personal data.\nEmploys techniques to maintain long-term access, such as modifying system registries and utilizing startup folders.\nUses obfuscation and encryption to evade detection by security solutions.\nInside ANY.RUN's analysis session, we can open the MalConf section to reveal the malicious configurations used by AsyncRAT.\nView AsyncRAT analysis session\nMalicious configurations analyzed inside controlled environment\nAs we can see, AsyncRAT connects to masterpoldo02[.]kozow[.]com over port 7575, allowing remote attackers to control infected machines. Blocking this domain and monitoring traffic to this port can help prevent infections.\nBesides, AsyncRAT installs itself in %AppData% to blend in with legitimate applications and uses a mutex (AsyncMutex_alosh) to prevent multiple instances from running.\nThe malware also uses AES encryption with a hardcoded key and salt, making it difficult for security tools to analyze its communications.\nAES encryption used by AsyncRAT\nLumma Stealer: GitHub-Based Distribution\nIn early 2025, cybersecurity experts uncovered a sophisticated campaign involving Lumma Stealer, an information-stealing malware.\nAttackers used GitHub's release infrastructure to distribute this malware, exploiting the platform's trustworthiness to bypass security measures.\nOnce executed, Lumma Stealer initiates additional malicious activities, including downloading and running other threats like SectopRAT, Vidar, Cobeacon, and additional Lumma Stealer variants.\nTechnical Characteristics of Lumma Stealer\nDistributed through GitHub releases, leveraging trusted infrastructure to evade security detection.\nSteals browser credentials, cookies, cryptocurrency wallets, and system information.\nSends stolen data to remote servers, enabling real-time exfiltration.\nCan download and execute additional malware, including SectopRAT, Vidar, and Cobeacon.\nUses registry modifications and startup entries to maintain access.\nDetectable through network-based security monitoring tools, revealing malicious communication patterns.\nView Lumma analysis session\nLumma Stealer analyzed inside ANY.RUN virtual machine\nA detailed examination using the ANY.RUN sandbox demonstrates Lumma Stealer's behavior.\nUpon execution, the malware connects to its command-and-control server, facilitating the exfiltration of sensitive data. The analysis also reveals the triggering of specific Suricata rules:\nSuricata rule triggered by Lumma Stealer\nThe analysis session also reveals how Lumma steals credentials from web browsers and exfiltrates personal data:\nCredentials and personal data theft by Lumma Stealer\nInvisibleFerret: The Silent Threat Lurking in Fake Job Offers\nIn a wave of social engineering attacks, cybercriminals have been leveraging InvisibleFerret, a stealthy Python-based malware, to compromise unsuspecting victims.\nDisguised as legitimate software in fake job interview processes, this malware has been actively used in the fake interview campaign, where attackers pose as recruiters to trick professionals into downloading malicious tools.\nTechnical Characteristics of InvisibleFerret\nThe malware employs disorganized and obfuscated Python scripts, making analysis and detection challenging.\nInvisibleFerret actively searches for and exfiltrates sensitive information, including source code, cryptocurrency wallets, and personal files.\nOften delivered as a secondary payload by another malware called\nBeaverTail\n, which is an obfuscated JavaScript-based infostealer and loader.\nThe malware establishes persistence on the infected system, ensuring continued access and control.\nA key element of the InvisibleFerret attack is the deployment of BeaverTail, a malicious NPM module that delivers a portable Python environment (p.zip) to execute the malware.\nActing as the first stage in a multi-layered attack chain, BeaverTail sets up InvisibleFerret, a stealthy backdoor with advanced obfuscation and persistence mechanisms, making detection difficult.\nBy submitting InvisibleFerret to ANY.RUN's Interactive Sandbox, we can analyze its behavior in real time:\nView InvisibleFerret analysis session\nInvisibleFerret behavior analyzed by ANY.RUN sandbox\nThe malware starts by collecting system information, such as OS version, hostname, username, and geolocation, using services like ip-api.com, a method also used by cryptocurrency drainers.\nExfiltrated information analyzed inside ANY.RUN sandbox\nMalicious requests blend with normal traffic, making detection challenging. ANY.RUN's interface highlights these activities, showing network requests in orange and red beneath the virtual machine.\nMalicious requests are blended with legitimate traffic, all directed by the same script\nClicking on the ATT&CK button in ANY.RUN's sandbox provides a breakdown of InvisibleFerret's TTPs. One key detection is T1016 (\"System Network Configuration Discovery\"), which highlights how the malware gathers geolocation and system data.\nMain TTPs used by InvisibleFerret\nDon't Let Threats Go Unnoticed - Detect Them with ANY.RUN\nThe first quarter of 2025 has been filled with stealthy and aggressive cyber threats, from ransomware operations to silent data stealers.

        "Content": "A large-scale malware campaign has been found leveraging a vulnerable Windows driver associated with Adlice's product suite to sidestep detection efforts and deliver the\nGh0st RAT malware\n.\n\"To further evade detection, the attackers deliberately generated multiple variants (with different hashes) of the 2.0.2 driver by modifying specific PE parts while keeping the signature valid,\" Check Point\nsaid\nin a new report published Monday.\nThe cybersecurity company said the malicious activity involved thousands of first-stage malicious samples that are used to deploy a program capable of terminating endpoint detection and response (EDR) software by means of what's called a bring your own vulnerable driver (\nBYOVD\n) attack.\nAs many as 2,500 distinct variants of the legacy version 2.0.2 of the vulnerable RogueKiller Antirootkit Driver, truesight.sys, have been identified on the VirusTotal platform, although the number is believed to be likely higher. The EDR-killer module was first detected and recorded in June 2024.\nThe issue with the Truesight driver, an arbitrary process termination bug affecting all versions below 3.4.0, has been previously weaponized to devise proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits such as\nDarkside\nand\nTrueSightKiller\nthat are publicly available since at least November 2023.\nIn March 2024, SonicWall\nrevealed\ndetails of a loader called DBatLoader that was found to have utilized the truesight.sys driver to kill security solutions before delivering the Remcos RAT malware.\nThere is some evidence to suggest that the campaign could be the work of a threat actor called the\nSilver Fox APT\ndue to\nsome\nlevel of overlaps\nin the execution chain and the tradecraft employed, including the \"infection vector, execution chain, similarities in initial-stage samples [...], and historical targeting patterns.\"\nThis is also reinforced by the fact that around 75% of the victims are located in China, with the remainder concentrated in other parts of Asia, primarily Singapore and Taiwan.\nThe attack sequences involve the distribution of first-stage artifacts that are often disguised as legitimate applications and propagated via deceptive websites offering deals on luxury products and fraudulent channels in popular messaging apps like Telegram.\nThe samples act as a downloader, dropping the legacy version of the Truesight driver, as well as the next-stage payload that mimics common file types, such as PNG, JPG, and GIF. The second-stage malware then proceeds to retrieve another malware that, in turn, loads the EDR-killer module and the Gh0st RAT malware.\n\"While the variants of the legacy Truesight driver (version 2.0.2) are typically downloaded and installed by the initial-stage samples, they can also be deployed directly by the EDR/AV killer module if the driver is not already present on the system,\" Check Point explained.\n\"This indicates that although the EDR/AV killer module is fully integrated into the campaign, it is capable of operating independently of the earlier stages.\"\nThe module employs the BYOVD technique to abuse the susceptible driver for the purpose of terminating processes related to certain security software. In doing so, the attack offers an advantage in that it bypasses the\nMicrosoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist\n, a hash value-based Windows mechanism designed to protect the system against known vulnerable drivers.\nThe attacks culminated with the deployment of a variant of Gh0st RAT called\nHiddenGh0st\n, which is designed to remotely control compromised systems, giving attackers a way to conduct data theft, surveillance, and system manipulation.\nAs of December 17, 2024, Microsoft has updated the driver blocklist to include the driver in question, effectively blocking the exploitation vector.\n\"By modifying specific parts of the driver while preserving its digital signature, the attackers bypassed common detection methods, including the latest Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist and LOLDrivers detection mechanisms, allowing them to evade detection for months,\" Check Point said.\n\"Exploiting Arbitrary Process Termination vulnerability allowed the EDR/AV killer module to target and disable processes commonly associated with security solutions, further enhancing the campaign's stealth.\"\nFound this article interesting?

It's believed the campaign has been ongoing for at least two years, when some of the fake projects were published. A majority of the infection attempts have been recorded in Russia, Brazil, and Turkey.\nThe projects in question are written in various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C, C++, and C#. But regardless of the language used, the end goal is the same: Launch an embedded malicious payload that's responsible for retrieving additional components from an attacker-controlled GitHub repository and executing them.\nProminent among these modules is a Node.js information stealer that collects passwords, bank account information, saved credentials, cryptocurrency wallet data, and web browsing history; compresses them into a .7z archive, and exfiltrates it to the threat actors via Telegram.\nAlso downloaded via the bogus GitHub projects are remote administration tools like\nAsyncRAT\nand\nQuasar RAT\nthat can be used to commandeer infected hosts and a\nclipper malware\nthat can substitute wallet addressed copied into clipboard with an adversary-owned wallet so as to reroute the digital assets to the threat actors.\n\"As code sharing platforms such as GitHub are used by millions of developers worldwide, threat actors will certainly continue using fake software as an infection lure in the future,\" Kaspersky researcher Georgy Kucherin said.\n\"For that reason, it is crucial to handle processing of third-party code very carefully.

In September 2023, Proofpoint\ndocumented\nanother email phishing campaign that propagated various malware families such as FatalRAT, Gh0st RAT, Purple Fox, and ValleyRAT.\nAn interesting aspect of both intrusion sets is that they have primarily targeted Chinese-language speakers and Japanese organizations. Some of these activities have been attributed to a threat actor tracked as\nSilver Fox APT\n.\nThe starting point of the latest attack chain is a phishing email containing a ZIP archive with a Chinese-language filename, which, when launched, launches the first-stage loader that, in turn, makes a request to Youdao Cloud Notes in order to retrieve a DLL file and a FatalRAT configurator.\nFor its part, the configurator module downloads the contents of another note from note.youdao[.]com so as to access the configuration information. It's also engineered to open a decoy file in an effort to avoid raising suspicion.\nThe DLL, on the other hand, is a second-stage loader that's responsible for downloading and installing the FatalRAT payload from a server (\"myqcloud[.]com\") specified in the configuration, while displaying a fake error message about a problem running the application.\nAn important hallmark of the campaign includes the use of DLL side-loading techniques to advance the multi-stage infection sequence and load the FatalRAT malware.\n\"The threat actor uses a black and white method where the actor leverages the functionality of legitimate binaries to make the chain of events look like normal activity,\" Kaspersky said. \"The attackers also used a DLL side-loading technique to hide the persistence of the malware in legitimate process memory.\"\n\"FatalRAT performs 17 checks for an indicator that the malware executes in a virtual machine or sandbox environment. If any of the checks fail, the malware stops executing.\"\nIt also terminates all instances of the rundll32.exe process, and gathers information about the system and the various security solutions installed in it, before awaiting further instructions from a command-and-control (C2) server.\nFatalRAT is a feature-packed trojan that's equipped to log keystrokes, corrupt Master Boot Record (MBR), turn on/off screen, search and delete user data in browsers like Google Chrome and Internet Explorer, download additional software like AnyDesk and UltraViewer, perform file operations, and start/stop a proxy, and terminate arbitrary processes.\nIt's currently not known who is behind the attacks using FatalRAT, although the tactical and instrumentation overlaps with other campaigns suggest that \"they all reflect different series of attacks that are somehow related.\" Kaspersky has assessed with medium confidence that a Chinese-speaking threat actor is behind it.\n\"FatalRAT's functionality gives an attacker almost unlimited possibilities for developing an attack: spreading over a network, installing remote administration tools, manipulating devices, stealing, and deleting confidential information,\" the researchers said.\n\"The consistent use of services and interfaces in Chinese at various stages of the attack, as well as other indirect evidence, indicates that a Chinese-speaking actor may be involved.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Although this limits its long-term impact, it still provides remote access to threat actors who may be able to achieve root through other means.\nAuto-Color infection chain\nSource: Unit 42\nAuto-Color decrypts command-and-control (C2) server information using a custom encryption algorithm and validates the exchange via a random 16-byte value handshake.\nCustom encryption is used for obfuscation of C2 server addresses, configuration data, and network traffic, while the encryption key changes dynamically with each request to make detection more difficult.\nOnce the connection has been established, the C2 may order Auto-Color to perform one of the following actions:\nOpen a reverse shell, allowing the operators full remote access.\nExecute arbitrary commands on the system.\nModify or create files to expand the infection.\nAct as a proxy, forwarding attacker traffic.\nModify its configuration dynamically.\nCommands supported by Auto-Color\nSource: Unit 42\nAuto-Color also has rootkit-like features like hooking libc functions to intercept system calls, which it uses to hide C2 connections by modifying the /proc/net/tcp file.\nUnit 42 says Auto-Color also features a built-in \"kill switch,\" which allows the attackers to immediately delete infection traces from the compromised machines to impede investigations.\nHow to defend\nGiven its stealth, modular design, and remote control features, Auto-Color is a serious threat to Linux systems, particularly those in government and academic environments targeted in the observed attacks.\nUnit 42 suggests monitoring changes to '/etc/ld.preload,' which is a key persistence mechanism, checking '/proc/net/tcp' for output anomalies, and using behavior-based threat detection solutions.\nThe researchers have also listed indicators of compromise (IoCs) at the bottom of the report, so inspecting system logs and network traffic for connections to the listed C2 IPs is also crucial.\nRelated Articles:\nSpyLend Android malware downloaded 100,000 times from Google Play\nPhishing attack hides JavaScript using invisible Unicode trick\nChinese hackers abuse Microsoft APP-v tool to evade antivirus\nMicrosoft says attackers use exposed ASP.NET keys to deploy malware\nMicrosoft spots XCSSET macOS malware variant used for crypto theft"

The company intiated an investigation and is working to minimize the impact of the incident.\nAccording to the threat actor, who uses the alias Rey and is a member of the HellCat ransomware group, the stolen data is mostly from the Romanian branch of the company and includes 380,000 unique email addresses, source code, invoices, contracts, customer and employee information.\nOrange data leak posted on a hacker forum\nRey told BleepingComputer that the breach was not a HellCat ransomware operation and that they had access to Orange’s systems for over a month.\nOn Sunday morning, they started exfiltrating company data and the activity ran for about three hours without the company detecting it.\nSome samples shared with BleepingComputer show email addresses from former and current Orange Romania employees, partners, and contractors, along with partial details for payment cards belonging to Romanian customers.\nSome of the data we verfied was quite old. For instance, some of the email addresses were used by individuals that had worked or collaborated with Orange Romania more than five years ago.\nIn the sample with partial payment card information, we found many instances where the data had expired. The leak also contains email addresses and names of Yoxo customers, Orange's subscription service with no contract period.\nRey says that they stole almost 12,000 files totaling close to 6.5GB after compromising Orange’s systems by exploiting compromised credentials, and vulnerabilities in the company’s Jira software for bug/issue tracking, and internal portals.\nFiles and size for data stolen from Orange telco operator\nsource: Rey\nThe threat actor told us they dropped a ransom note on the compromised system but Orange did not initiate negotiations.\nBleepingComputer reached out to both Orange Group and Orange Romania with a request for comment and the company said they were looking into the matter.\nA joint statement was shared and an Orange spokesperson told us that they've been discussing internally on the incident and the steps to mitigate it.\n\"Orange can confirm that our operations in Romania have been the target of a cyberattack,\" a company representative told BleepingComputer.\n\"We took immediate action, and our top priority remains protecting the data and interests of our employees, customers and partners. There has been no impact on customers’ operations, and the breach was found to occur on a non-critical back office application\" - Orange\nThe company representative said their \"cybersecurity and IT teams are working hard to assess the extent of the breach and minimize the impact of this incident.\"\n“We are committed to providing regular updates. Additionally, we are committed to complying with all legal obligations associated with such incidents and we are cooperating with the relevant authorities to address this matter,” reads the rest of the statement.\nRey told us they breached Orange independently but they are part of the HellCat ransomware group, which has claimed attacks on\nSchneider Electric\nand Spanish telecommunications company\nTelefónica\n.\nIn both breaches, the hackers targeted Jira servers and scraped or stole 40GB of data and 2.5GB of documents respectively.\nRelated Articles:\nHacker leaks account data of 12 million Zacks Investment users\nGlobe Life data breach may impact an additional 850,000 clients\nOtelier data breach exposes info, hotel reservations of millions\nTelefónica confirms internal ticketing system breach after data leak\nSTIIIZY data breach exposes cannabis buyers’ IDs and purchases"

One of them has been named Bauxite, which has been linked to Iran. Operating under the hacktivist persona CyberAv3ngers, Bauxite has targeted organizations in the US, Europe, Australia and the Middle East, including sectors such as energy, water, food and beverage, and chemical manufacturing.\n\n\n\nThe hackers were recently seen using a custom-built malware named IOCONTROL to target IoT and OT devices in the US and Israel.\n\n\n\nThe second group added to Dragos’ list has been named Graphite. This Russia-linked threat actor is also known as APT28 and it has mainly targeted entities related to the Ukraine military conflict. \n\n\n\nSave the date: 2025 ICS Cyber Security Conference – October 27-30, Atlanta\nOf the nine groups that were active in OT operations in 2024, four are known to have ICS Cyber Kill Chain Stage 2 capabilities, which indicates that they can develop and test specific and meaningful attacks on industrial control systems. \n\n\n\nIn addition to Bauxite, the list of groups with Stage 2 capabilities includes Chernovite (the group behind the Pipedream/Incontroller attack), Voltzite (aka Volt Typhoon, which exfiltrated sensitive OT data), and Electrum (aka Sandworm, which developed a new wiper capability named AcidPour). Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nDragos noted that AcidPour can target OT devices and has the potential to cause significant damage and disruption.\n\n\n\nThe ICS/OT security firm has also tracked ransomware attacks on industrial organizations, which surged last year. Dragos saw 80 groups targeting industrial organizations, up from 50 groups in 2023, and an overall increase of 87% in ransomware activity compared to the previous year. \n\n\n\nThe company noted that it did not see any ICS-specific ransomware, but these types of threats did cause disruptions and allowed the exfiltration of sensitive data that could be used for further malicious activity.  \n\n\n\nTwo new pieces of ICS malware came to light in 2024: Fuxnet, a destructive malware used by Ukraine against Russian infrastructure, and FrostyGoop, which left a Ukrainian city’s residents without heating. \n\n\n\nThe full Dragos 2025 OT/ICS Cybersecurity Report is available in PDF format. \n\n\n\nRelated: Free Diagram Tool Aids Management of Complex ICS/OT Cybersecurity Decisions\nRelated: Orthanc Server Vulnerability Poses Risk to Medical Data, Healthcare Operations\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: OT Security\n\nDragos tracks a total of 23 threat groups that have targeted OT organizations over the past years, and nine of them were active in 2024.\n\n\n\nTwo of them are newly added groups.

The security hole, described as a high-severity deserialization issue, can allow a low-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary code and take over the software. \n\n\n\nThe issue was reported to Oracle through Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), which disclosed very limited technical details in an advisory published in February 2024.\n\n\n\n“The specific flaw exists within the ExportServlet. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user,” ZDI’s advisory reads.\n\n\n\nNo information appears to be publicly available on the attacks describing exploitation of this Oracle Agile PLM vulnerability. \n\n\n\nHowever, since exploitation of the vulnerability requires authentication, it’s likely exploited by attackers after they have gained initial access to a system via the exploitation of a different flaw. This indicates that CVE-2024-20953 has likely been exploited in targeted attacks.\n\n\n\nThis is the second Agile PLM vulnerability flagged as exploited in the wild in recent months. In November 2024, Oracle announced patches for CVE-2024-21287 and warned that it had been exploited in attacks.\n\n\n\nCVE-2024-21287, however, has been rated ‘critical severity’ as it can be exploited remotely without authentication to access critical data. No information seems to be publicly available on the exploitation of CVE-2024-21287 either. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability was spotted last year by CrowdStrike. It’s unclear if the two Agile PLM vulnerabilities have been exploited in the same attacks.\n\n\n\nSecurityWeek has reached out to the security firm for additional information and will update this article if it responds.\n\n\n\nCISA has instructed federal agencies to address CVE-2024-20953 in their environments by March 17. \n\n\n\nIt’s not uncommon for threat actors to exploit Oracle product vulnerabilities in their attacks, but in most cases they have targeted WebLogic flaws.\n\n\n\nCISA on Monday also added an Adobe ColdFusion vulnerability tracked as CVE-2017-3066 to its KEV list, but exploitation of this flaw has been known since 2018. \n\n\n\nRelated: CISA Warns of Attacks Exploiting Craft CMS Vulnerability\nRelated: Second Recently Patched Flaw Exploited to Hack Palo Alto Firewalls\nRelated: CISA Issues Exploitation Warning for .NET Vulnerability\n\nThe vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-20953, was patched in the PLM product in January 2024.

This indicates that CVE-2024-20953 has likely been exploited in targeted attacks.\n\n\n\nThis is the second Agile PLM vulnerability flagged as exploited in the wild in recent months. In November 2024, Oracle announced patches for CVE-2024-21287 and warned that it had been exploited in attacks.\n\n\n\nCVE-2024-21287, however, has been rated ‘critical severity’ as it can be exploited remotely without authentication to access critical data.
