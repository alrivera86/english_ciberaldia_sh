It was\nfirst documented\nby Trend Micro in August 2020.\nSubsequent\niterations of the malware\nhave been found to adapt to compromise newer versions of macOS as well as Apple's own M1 chipsets. In mid-2021, the cybersecurity company noted that XCSSET had been updated to exfiltrate data from various apps like Google Chrome, Telegram, Evernote, Opera, Skype, WeChat, and Apple first-party apps such as Contacts and Notes.\nAnother report from Jamf around the same time\nrevealed\nthe malware's ability to exploit CVE-2021-30713, a Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) framework bypass bug, as a zero-day to take screenshots of the victim's desktop without requiring additional permissions.\nThen, over a year later, it was\nupdated again\nto add support for macOS Monterey. As of writing, the origins of the malware remain unknown.\nThe latest findings from Microsoft mark the first major revision since 2022, using improved obfuscation methods and persistence mechanisms that are aimed at challenging analysis efforts and ensuring that the malware is launched every time a new shell session is initiated.\nAnother novel manner XCSSET sets up persistence entails downloading a signed dockutil utility from a command-and-control server to manage the dock items.\n\"The malware then creates a fake Launchpad application and replaces the legitimate Launchpad's path entry in the dock with this fake one,\" Microsoft said. \"This ensures that every time the Launchpad is started from the dock, both the legitimate Launchpad and the malicious payload are executed.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Cyber threats evolve—has your defense strategy kept up? A new free guide available\nhere\nexplains why Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) is the smart approach for proactive cybersecurity.\nThis concise\nreport\nmakes a clear business case for why CTEM's comprehensive approach is the best overall strategy for shoring up a business's cyber defenses in the face of evolving attacks. It also presents a real-world scenario that illustrates how the business would fare against a formjacking attack under three security frameworks - Vulnerability Management (VM), Attack Surface Management (ASM), and CTEM. With VM, the attack might go unnoticed for weeks. With CTEM, simulated attacks detect and neutralize it before it starts.\nReassuringly, it also explains that CTEM builds on a business's current VM and ASM solutions rather than requiring them to jettison anything they currently use.\nBut first—\nWhat is CTEM?\nIn response to increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks,\nGartner introduced\nContinuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) in 2022 as a more proactive security strategy. It laid out a five-step sequence of phases:\nVM and ASM Limitations\nWith CTEM's holistic approach, security teams can assess both internal and external threats and respond based on business priorities. Part of the problem with relying on a VM framework is that it focuses on identifying and patching\nknown\nvulnerabilities within a company's internal infrastructure. It's limited in scope and reactive by nature, so while this approach may be useful for dealing with an attack at the moment, VM-oriented solutions don't look beyond that. ASM offers a wider scope but is still limited. It provides visibility into external assets but lacks continuous validation capabilities, as\nthe report\nexplains.\nCTEM combines the strengths of VM and ASM but also provides continuous monitoring, threat validation, attack simulation, penetration testing, and prioritization based on business impact.\nCTEM is More Business-Relevant\nFor CISOs, prioritizing security efforts based on business impact is critical. Modern websites are highly dynamic, so security teams don't have the time to block and investigate every single change that might occur without severely limiting website functionality and negatively affecting the business.\nCTEM seeks to strike a balance between the competing demands of risk and cost by identifying and prioritizing the most potentially damaging risk factors. The level of risk that each business is willing to accept is referred to as its\nrisk appetite\n, and by implementing a CTEM solution, it can respond to the threats it faces according to its own unique definition of where that level lies.\nCTEM is a mature and effective strategy for managing today's complex threat landscape, and while it can unlock better security cost-effectively, it does require strategic implementation. There are various CTEM solutions on the market that will fulfill the requirements of some or all of the implementation stages, and the\ndownloadable PDF\nlists several of them (as well as a selection of VM and ASM solutions).\nA good one will map all assets in a website's digital infrastructure and monitor them for the kind of changes that signal the start of\nMagecart\n, ransomware, and other attacks, deliver timely alerts according to the company's risk appetite, assist with compliance monitoring, and more.\nDownload the guide now\nto learn how CTEM can proactively protect your business from formjacking, ransomware, and other advanced threats.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Welcome to this week's Cybersecurity News Recap. Discover how cyber attackers are using clever tricks like fake codes and sneaky emails to gain access to sensitive data. We cover everything from device code phishing to cloud exploits, breaking down the technical details into simple, easy-to-follow insights.\n⚡ Threat of the Week\nRussian Threat Actors Leverage Device Code Phishing to Hack Microsoft Accounts\n— Microsoft and Volexity have\nrevealed\nthat threat actors with ties to Russia are leveraging a technique known as device code phishing to gain unauthorized access to victim accounts, and use that access to get hold of sensitive data and enable persistent access to the victim environment. At least three different Russia-linked clusters have been identified abusing the technique to date. The attacks entail sending phishing emails that masquerade as Microsoft Teams meeting invitations, which, when clicked, urge the message recipients to authenticate using a threat actor-generated device code, thereby allowing the adversary to hijack the authenticated session using the valid access token.\nStop Playing The Hackers' Game Their Way\nIt's time for a new security approach. Replace traditional security technology that exposes your attack surface and allows lateral movement to access your data.\nUpgrade Security Now ➝\n🔔 Top News\nwhoAMI Attack Exploits AWS AMI Name Confusion for Remote Code Execution\n— A new type of name confusion attack called\nwhoAMI\nallows anyone who publishes an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with a specific name to gain code execution within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Datadog, which detailed the attack, said roughly 1% of organizations monitored by the company were affected by the whoAMI, and that it found public examples of code written in Python, Go, Java, Terraform, Pulumi, and Bash shell using the vulnerable criteria. AWS told The Hacker News that there is no evidence of malicious exploitation of the security weakness.\nRansomHub Targets Over 600 Orgs Globally\n— The RansomHub ransomware operation has\ntargeted over 600 organizations across the world\n, spanning sectors such as healthcare, finance, government, and critical infrastructure, making it one of the most active cybercrime groups in 2024. One such attack has been found to weaponize now-patched security flaws in Microsoft Active Directory and the Netlogon protocol to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access to a victim network's domain controller as part of their post-compromise strategy.\nREF7707 Uses Outlook Drafts for Command-and-Control\n— A previously undocumented threat activity cluster dubbed\nREF7707\nhas been observed using a remote administration tool named FINALDRAFT that parses commands stored in the mailbox's drafts folder and writes the results of the execution into new draft emails for each command. It makes use of the Outlook email service via the Microsoft Graph API for command-and-control (C2) purposes. The group has been observed targeting the foreign ministry of an unnamed South American nation, as well as a telecommunications entity and a university, both located in Southeast Asia.\nKimsuky Embraces ClickFix-Style Attack Strategy\n— The North Korean threat actor known as\nKimsuky\n(aka Black Banshee) is using a new tactic that involves deceiving targets into running PowerShell as an administrator and then instructing them to paste and run malicious code provided by them. \"To execute this tactic, the threat actor masquerades as a South Korean government official and over time builds rapport with a target before sending a spear-phishing email with an [sic] PDF attachment,\" Microsoft said. Users are then convinced to click on a URL, urging them to register their device in order to read the PDF attachment. The end goal of the attack is to establish a data communication mechanism that allows the adversary to exfiltrate data.\nLaw Enforcement Op Takes Down 8Base\n— A consortium of law enforcement agencies has\narrested\nfour Russian nationals and seized over 100 servers linked to the 8Base ransomware gang. The arrests were made in Thailand. Two of the suspects are accused of operating a cybercrime group that used Phobos ransomware to victimize more than 1,000 public and private entities in the country and across the world. The development comes in the aftermath of a series of high-profile ransomware disruptions associated with Hive, LockBit, and BlackCat in recent years. Late last year, Evgenii Ptitsyn, a 42-year-old Russian national believed to be the administrator of the Phobos ransomware, was extradited to the U.S.\n‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs\nYour go-to software could be hiding dangerous security flaws—don't wait until it's too late!

This included detailed information about the architecture and functionality of Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chips and systems and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) systems, the software that allows the chips to communicate and execute tasks, and the software that orchestrates thousands of chips into a supercomputer capable of training and executing cutting-edge AI workloads. The trade secrets also relate to Google's custom-designed SmartNIC, a type of network interface card used to enhance Google's GPU, high performance, and cloud networking products. \"Ding intended to benefit the PRC government by stealing trade secrets from Google,\" the U.S. Department of Justice\nsaid\n. \"Ding allegedly stole technology relating to the hardware infrastructure and software platform that allows Google's supercomputing data center to train and serve large AI models.\" The superseding indictment also stated that Chinese-sponsored talent programs incentivize individuals engaged in research and development outside the country to transmit such information in exchange for salaries, research funds, lab space, or other incentives. If convicted, Ding faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine for each trade-secret count and 15 years in prison and a $5,000,000 fine for each economic espionage count.\nWindows UI Flaw Exploited by Mustang Panda\n— Israeli cybersecurity company ClearSky has warned that a suspected Chinese nation-state group known as\nMustang Panda\nis actively exploiting a UI vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. \"When files are extracted from compressed 'RAR' files they are hidden from the user,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"If the compressed files are extracted into a folder, the folder appears empty in the Windows Explorer GUI. When using the 'dir' command to list all files and folders inside the target folder, the extracted files and folders are 'invisible/hidden' to the user. Threat actors or users can also execute those compressed files from a command line prompt, if they know the exact path. As a result of executing 'attrib -s -h' to system protected files, an unknown file type is created from the type 'Unknown' ActiveX component.\" It's currently not clear who are the targets of the attack, and what the end goals of the campaign are.\nMeta Paid Over $2.3M in Bug Bounty Rewards in 2024\n— Meta\nsaid\nit paid out more than $2.3 million in rewards to nearly 200 security researchers as part of its bug bounty program in 2024. In total, the company has handed out more than $20 million since the creation of the program in 2011. The top three countries based on bounties awarded in 2024 are India, Nepal, and the United States.\nCritical ThinkPHP and OwnCloud Flaws Under Active Exploitation\n— Threat actors are\nattempting\nto actively exploit two known security vulnerabilities impacting ThinkPHP (CVE-2022-47945, CVSS score: 9.8) and OwnCloud (CVE-2023-49103, CVSS score: 10.0) over the past few days, with attacks originating from hundreds of unique IP addresses, most of which are based in Germany, China, the U.S., Singapore, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Canada. Organizations are recommended to apply the necessary patches (ThinkPHP to 6.0.14+ and ownCloud GraphAPI to 0.3.1+) and restrict access to reduce the attack surface.\nFSB Mole Arrested in Ukraine\n— The Secret Service of Ukraine (SSU)\nsaid\nit had detained one of its own high-level officials, accusing them of acting as a mole for Russia. The individual, one of the officials of the SSU Counterterrorism Center, is alleged to have been recruited by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) in Vienna in 2018, and actively began engaging in espionage at the end of December last year, transmitting documents containing state secrets, to the intelligence agency via a \"special mobile phone.\" The SSU, upon learning of the man's actions, said it \"used him in a counterintelligence 'game': through the traitor the SSU fed the enemy a large amount of disinformation.\" The individual's name was not disclosed, but the Kyiv Independent\nsaid\nit's Colonel Dmytro Kozyura, citing unnamed SSU sources.\nLLMjacking Hits DeepSeek\n— Malicious actors have been observed capitalizing on the popularity of AI chatbot platform DeepSeek to conduct what's called\nLLMjacking\nattacks that involve selling the access obtained to legitimate cloud environments to other actors for a price. These attacks involve the use of stolen credentials to allow access to machine learning services via the OpenAI Reverse Proxy (ORP), which acts as a reverse proxy server for LLMs of various providers. The ORP operators hide their IP addresses using\nTryCloudflare tunnels\n. Ultimately, the illicit LLM access is used to generate NSFW content, and malicious scripts, and even circumvent bans on ChatGPT in countries like China and Russia, where the service is blocked. \"Cloud-based LLM usage costs can be staggering, surpassing several hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly,\" Sysdig\nsaid\n. \"The high cost of LLMs is the reason cybercriminals choose to steal credentials rather than pay for LLM services. Due to steep costs, a black market for access has developed around OAI Reverse Proxies — and underground service providers have risen to meet the needs of consumers.\"\nRomance Baiting Scams Jump 40% YoY\n—\nPig butchering scams\n, also called romance baiting, have accounted for 33.2% of the estimated $9.9 billion revenue earned by cybercriminals in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams, growing nearly 40% year-over-year. However, the average deposit amount to pig butchering scams declined 55% YoY, likely indicating a shift in how these scams are conducted. \"Pig butchering scammers have also evolved to diversify their business model beyond the 'long con' of pig butchering scams — which can take months and even years of developing a relationship before receiving victim payments — to quicker turnaround\nemployment or work-from-home scams\nthat typically yield smaller victim deposits,\" Chainalysis\nsaid\n. Further analysis of on-chain activity has found that\nHuiOne Guarantee\nis heavily used for illicit crypto-based activities supporting the pig butchering industry in Southeast Asia. Scammers have also been observed\nusing\ngenerative AI technology to facilitate crypto scams, often to impersonate others or generate realistic content.\nSecurity Issues in RedNote Flagged\n— It's not just DeepSeek. A new network security analysis undertaken by the Citizen Lab has uncovered multiple issues in RedNote's (aka Xiaohongshu) Android and iOS apps. This includes fetching viewed images and videos over HTTP, transmitting insufficiently encrypted device metadata, as well as a vulnerability that enables network attackers to learn the contents of any files that RedNote has permission to read on the users' devices. While the second vulnerability was introduced by an upstream analytics SDK, MobTech, the third issue was introduced by NEXTDATA. As of writing, all the flaws remain unpatched. The vulnerabilities \"could enable surveillance by any government or ISP, and not just the Chinese government,\" the Citizen Lab\nsaid\n.\nCISA Urges Orgs to Address Buffer Overflows\n— The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have released a Secure by Design Alert, urging organizations to eliminate buffer overflow vulnerabilities in software. \"These vulnerabilities can lead to data corruption, sensitive data exposure, program crashes, and unauthorized code execution,\" the agencies\nsaid\n, labeling them as unforgivable defects. \"Threat actors frequently exploit these vulnerabilities to gain initial access to an organization's network and then move laterally to the wider network.\" Saeed Abbasi, manager of vulnerability research at Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU), emphasized the need to switch from memory unsafe languages. \"Legacy excuses are out; the world has zero tolerance for memory-unsafe code in 2025,\" Abbasi said. \"Yes, rewriting old systems is daunting, but letting attackers exploit decades-old buffer overflows is worse. Organizations still clinging to unsafe languages risk turning minor vulnerabilities into massive breaches—and they can't claim surprise. We've had proven fixes for ages: phased transitions to Rust or other memory-safe options, compiler-level safeguards, thorough adversarial testing, and public commitments to a secure-by-design roadmap. The real challenge is collective will: leadership must demand memory-safe transitions, and software buyers must hold vendors accountable.\"\nForeign Adversaries Target Local Communities in the U.S. for Influence Ops\n— A new report from the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) has found that foreign nation-state actors from Russia, China, and Iran are running influence operations that exploit trust in local sources and impact state and local communities in the U.S. with an aim to manipulate public opinion, stoke discord, and undermine democratic institutions. \"In some cases, adversarial nations seek favorable outcomes around local policy issues; in others, they use local debates as Trojan horses to advance their broader geopolitical agendas,\" the research\nsaid\n. Russia emerged as the most active threat actor, with 26 documented cases designed to polarize Americans through themes related to immigration and election integrity. Beijing, on the other hand, sought to cultivate support for Chinese state interests.\nFinancial Orgs Asked to Switch to Quantum-Safe Cryptography\n— Europol is urging financial institutions and policymakers to transition to\nquantum-safe cryptography\n, citing an \"imminent\" threat to cryptographic security due to the rapid advancement of quantum computing. The primary risk is that threat actors could steal encrypted data today with the intention of decrypting it in the future using quantum computing, a technique called \"harvest now, decrypt later\" or retrospective decryption. \"A sufficiently advanced quantum computer has the potential to break widely used public-key cryptographic algorithms, endangering the confidentiality of financial transactions, authentication processes, and digital contracts,\" the agency\nsaid\n. \"While estimates suggest that quantum computers capable of such threats could emerge within the next 10 to 15 years, the time required to transition away from vulnerable cryptographic methods is significant. A successful transition to post-quantum cryptography requires collaboration among financial institutions, technology providers, policymakers, and regulators.\" Last year, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) formally\nannounced\nthe first three \"quantum-safe\" algorithms.\nGoogle Addresses High Impact Flaws\n— Google has\naddressed\na pair of security flaws that could be chained by malicious actors to unmask the email address of any YouTube channel owner's email address. The first of the two is a vulnerability identified in a YouTube API that could leak a user's\nGAIA ID\n, a unique identifier used by Google to manage accounts across its network of sites. This ID could then be fed as input to an outdated web API associated with\nPixel Recorder\nto convert it into an email when sharing a recording. Following responsible disclosure on September 24, 2024, the issues were resolved as of February 9, 2025. There is no evidence that these shortcomings were ever abused in the wild.\nNew DoJ Actions Target Crypto Fraud\n— Eric Council Jr., 25, of Alabama, has\npleaded guilty\nto charges related to the January 2024 hacking of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) X account. The account was taken over to falsely announce that the SEC approved BTC Exchange Traded Funds, causing a spike in the price of bitcoin. The attack was carried out through an unauthorized Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) swap carried out by the defendant, tricking a mobile phone provider store to reassign the victim's phone number to a SIM card in their possession using a fraudulent identity card printed using an ID card printer. Council, who was arrested in December 2024, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. In a related development, a 22-year-old man from Indiana, Evan Frederick Light, was\nsentenced\nto 20 years in federal prison for running a massive cryptocurrency theft scheme from his mother's basement. Light broke into an investment holdings company in South Dakota in February 2022, stealing customers' personal data and cryptocurrency worth over $37 million from nearly 600 victims. The stolen cryptocurrency was then funneled to various locations throughout the world, including several mixing services and gambling websites to conceal his identity and to hide the virtual currency. Separately, the Justice Department has also\ncharged\nCanadian national Andean Medjedovic, 22, for exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities in two decentralized finance crypto platforms, KyberSwap and Indexed Finance, to fraudulently obtain about $65 million from the protocols' investors between 2021 and 2023. A master's degree holder in mathematics from the University of Waterloo, Medjedovic is also alleged to have laundered the proceeds through mixers and\nbridge transactions\nin an attempt to conceal the source and ownership of the funds. Medjedovic is charged with one count of wire fraud, one count of unauthorized damage to a protected computer, one count of attempted Hobbs Act extortion, one count of money laundering conspiracy, and one count of money laundering. He faces over 30 years in prison.\nU.S. Lawmakers Warn Against U.K. Order for\nBackdoor to Apple Data\n— After reports emerged that security officials in the U.K. have ordered Apple to create a backdoor to access any Apple user's iCloud content, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Member of Congress Andy Biggs have\nsent a letter\nto Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, urging the U.K. to retract its order, citing it threatens the \"privacy and security of both the American people and the U.S. government. \"If the U.K. does not immediately reverse this dangerous effort, we urge you to reevaluate U.S.-U.K. cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as U.S. intelligence sharing with the U.K.,\" they added. The purported Apple backdoor request would reportedly allow authorities to access data currently secured by Advanced Data Protection, potentially\naffecting users worldwide\n. Wyden has also\nreleased\na draft version of the Global Trust in American Online Services Act that seeks to \"secure Americans' communications against abusive foreign demands to weaken the security of communications services and software used by Americans.\" While the\nsecurity\nexperts have criticized the order,  British officials have neither confirmed nor denied it.\n🎥 Cybersecurity Webinars\nWebinar 1:\nFrom Code to Runtime: Transform Your App Security\n— Join our webinar with Amir Kaushansky from Palo Alto Networks and see how ASPM can change your app security.

When all these devices share the same Wi‑Fi network, a breach in one device could potentially put your entire network at risk. Home network segmentation helps protect you by dividing your network into separate parts, similar to how large businesses isolate sensitive information.\nTo set this up, use your router's guest network or VLAN features to create different SSIDs, such as \"Home_Private\" for personal devices and \"Home_IoT\" for smart gadgets. Ensure each network uses strong encryption (WPA3 or WPA2) with unique passwords, and configure your router so devices on one network cannot communicate with those on another. Test your setup by connecting your devices accordingly and verifying that cross-network traffic is blocked, then periodically check your router's dashboard to keep the configuration working smoothly.\nConclusion\nThat wraps up this week's cybersecurity news. We've covered a broad range of stories—from the case of a former Google engineer charged with stealing key AI secrets to hackers taking advantage of a Windows user interface flaw. We've also seen how cybercriminals are moving into new areas like AI misuse and cryptocurrency scams, while law enforcement and industry experts work hard to catch up.\nThese headlines remind us that cyber threats come in many forms, and every day, new risks emerge that can affect everyone from large organizations to individual users. Keep an eye on these developments and take steps to protect your digital life. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to keeping you informed next week.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new Golang-based backdoor that uses Telegram as a mechanism for command-and-control (C2) communications.\nNetskope Threat Labs, which detailed the functions of the malware, described it as possibly of Russian origin.\n\"The malware is compiled in Golang and once executed it acts like a backdoor,\" security researcher Leandro Fróes\nsaid\nin an analysis published last week. \"Although the malware seems to still be under development it is completely functional.\"\nOnce launched, the backdoor is designed to check if it's running under a specific location and using a specific name – \"C:\\Windows\\Temp\\svchost.exe\" – and if not, it reads its own contents, writes them to that location, and creates a new process to launch the copied version and terminate itself.\nA notable aspect of the malware is that it uses an\nopen-source library\nthat offers Golang bindings for the Telegram Bot API for C2 purposes.\nThis involves interacting with the Telegram Bot API to receive new commands originating from an actor-controlled chat. It supports four different commands, although only three of them are currently implemented -\n/cmd - Execute commands via PowerShell\n/persist - Relaunch itself under \"C:\\Windows\\Temp\\svchost.exe\"\n/screenshot - Not implemented\n/selfdestruct - Delete the \"C:\\Windows\\Temp\\svchost.exe\" file and terminate itself\nThe output of these commands is sent back to the Telegram channel. Netskope said that the \"/screenshot\" command sends the message \"Screenshot captured\" despite it not being fully fleshed out.\nThe Russian roots of the malware are explained by the fact that the \"/cmd\" instruction sends the message \"Enter the command:\" in Russian to the chat.\n\"The use of cloud apps presents a complex challenge to defenders and attackers are aware of it,\" Fróes said. \"Other aspects such as how easy it is to set and start the use of the app are examples of why attackers use applications like that in different phases of an attack.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "JPMorgan Chase Bank (Chase) will soon start blocking Zelle payments to social media contacts to combat a significant rise in online scams utilizing the service for fraud.\nZelle is a highly popular digital payments network that allows users to transfer money quickly and securely between bank accounts. It is also integrated into the mobile apps of many banks in the United States, allowing for almost instant transfers without requiring cash or checks but lacking one crucial feature: purchase protection.\nIn a\nrecent update to its user policy\n, Chase explained that the payments service should not be used to buy goods from retailers or merchants, \"including on or through social media or social media marketplaces or messaging apps.\"\nAccording to scam reports from Chase customers who filed Zelle or wire transfer claims\nbetween June and December 2024\n, almost 50% of all reported scams originated on social media.\nIn response to these worrying statistics, the bank added that starting March 23, it would begin delaying, declining, or blocking Zelle payments to accounts if they were identified as originating from social media contact.\n\"For your protection, Chase will not allow you to send Zelle payments identified as originating from contact through social media. We'll decline those transactions because Zelle is meant to pay friends, family and other trusted recipients you know, not for others you meet on social media,\" the\nbank warned\n.\n\"We may request information from you (for example, when you set up a payment or add a recipient) regarding your purpose of payment, the method of contact with your recipient, or other details we deem appropriate to assess whether your payment has elevated fraud or scam risk, or is an illegal, ineligible or improper payment.\"\nChange likely prompted by CFPB lawsuit\nWhile Chase didn't share what exactly prompted this decision,\nthe U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) sued\nEarly Warning Services (Zelle's operator) and three of its owner banks (Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) in December for rushing the service into the market to compete with other payments platforms like Venmo and CashApp and failing to implement adequate consumer safeguards.\nAccording to CFPB's lawsuit, this resulted in hundreds of thousands of Zelle and bank customers losing over $870 million since the payment service was launched.\nThe affected consumers were also denied assistance and told to contact the scammers to recover their money, while the banks failed to investigate their complaints and provide them with legally required reimbursement for errors and fraud.\n\"The nation's largest banks felt threatened by competing payment apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,\" said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. \"By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves.\"\nChase is the U.S. consumer and commercial banking business of JPMorgan Chase, and it provides banking services to millions of Americans at more than 4,700 branches and 15,000 ATMs nationwide.\nRelated Articles:\nX now blocks Signal contact links, flags them as malicious"

Furthermore, other contact links for third-party messaging services like Telegram can be shared as usual on the X platform.\nMeanwhile, Signal.me links that were already posted on X prior to the application of the blocks are still clickable. However, users will see a warning stating that the link may be unsafe when clicking the link.\nWarning message used for existing links\nSource: BleepingComputer\nReasons unknown\nSignal.me links are unique URLs generated by the Signal messaging app that allow users to\nshare their contact\nwith others so they can easily contact them on Signal.\nThese links make it easier for people to connect without manually exchanging phone numbers, making it a private and safe way to initiate discussions.\nResearcher Tommy Mysk, who was among the\nfirst to discover the issue\nthis weekend, told BleepingComputer that the reason behind this action is unclear at this time.\n\"I discovered it by accident. I can't speculate, but the behavior looks very similar to when they banned Mastodon links,\" stated Mysk.\nIn 2023, after Elon Musk purchased Twitter, the social media platform began to block links to competing platforms, such as\nFacebook, Instagram, and Mastodon\n. This was soon rolled back after protests from users.\nMore recently, Musk has faced criticism over how the US department he heads, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has gained access to the data of several US government agencies.\nSignal, a popular end-to-end encryption communications app, is\nreportedly\nwidely used by federal employees to report DOGE's violations to journalists.\nHence, there's speculation that the Signal.me link blocks on X are politically driven. However, X has not made any statements about the blocks or responded to requests for comment.\nBleepingComputer has contacted Signal for a comment on the situation, and we will update this post as soon as we hear back.\nRelated Articles:\nCloudflare CDN flaw leaks user location data, even through secure chat apps\nHacker pleads guilty to SIM swap attack on US SEC X account\nBrave now lets you inject custom JavaScript to tweak websites\nMicrosoft kills off Defender 'Privacy Protection' VPN feature\nSignal will let you sync old messages when linking new devices"

        "Content": "A new variant of the XCSSET macOS modular malware has emerged in attacks that target users' sensitive information, including digital wallets and data from the legitimate Notes app.\nThe malware is typically distributed through infected Xcode projects. It has been around for at least five years and each update represents a milestone in XCSSET's development. The current improvements are the first ones observed since 2022.\nMicrosoft's Threat Intelligence team identified the latest variant in limited attacks and says that compared to past XCSSET variants, the new one features enhanced code obfuscation, better persistence, and new infection strategies.\nIn May 2021, Apple fixed a vulnerability that was actively\nexploited as a zero-day\nby XCSSET, an indication of the malware developer's capabilities.\nNew XCSSET variant in the wild\nMicrosoft\nwarns\ntoday of new attacks that use a variant of the XCSSET macOS malware with improvements across the board. Some of the key modifications the researchers spotted include:\nNew obfuscation\nthrough\nencoding techniques that rely on both Base64 and xxd (hexdump) methods that vary in the number of iterations. Module names in the code are also obfuscated, which makes more difficult analyzing their intent\nTwo persistence techniques (\nzshrc\nand\ndock\n)\nNew Xcode infection methods\n: the malware uses the TARGET, RULE, or FORCED_STRATEGY options to place the payload in the Xcode project. It may also insert the payload into the TARGET_DEVICE_FAMILY key within build settings, and runs it at a later stage\nFor the\nzshrc\npersistence method, the new XCSSET variant creates a file named ~/.zshrc_aliases that contains the payload and appends a command in the ~/.zshrc file. This way, the created file launches whenever a new shell session starts.\nFor the\ndock\nmethod, a signed dockutil tool is downloaded from the attacker's command-and-control (C2) server to manage dock items.\nXCSSET then creates a malicious Launchpad application with the payload and changes the legitimate app's path to point to the fake one. As a result, when the Launchpad in the dock starts, both the genuine application and the malicious payload are executed.\nXcode is Apple's developer toolset that comes with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and allows creating, testing, and distributing apps for all Apple platforms.\nAn Xcode project can be created from scratch or built based on resources downloaded/cloned from various repositories. By targeting them, XCSSET's operator can reach a larger pool of victims.\nXCSSET has multiple modules to parse data on the system, collect sensitive information, and exfiltrate it. The type of data targeted includes logins, info from\nchat applications and browsers\n, Notes app, digital wallets, system information and files.\nMicrosoft recommends inspecting and verifying Xcode projects and codebases cloned from unofficial repositories, as those can hide obfuscated malware or backdoors.\nRelated Articles:\nBanshee stealer evades detection using Apple XProtect encryption algo\nMicrosoft says attackers use exposed ASP.NET keys to deploy malware\nPirateFi game on Steam caught installing password-stealing malware\nDPRK hackers dupe targets into typing PowerShell commands as admin\nMicrosoft issues optional fix for Secure Boot zero-day used by malware"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nRussian hackers have been targeting government, defense, telecoms, and other organizations in a device code phishing campaign.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nA Russia-linked threat actor tracked as Storm-2372 has been targeting government and private organizations in a global campaign employing device code phishing for account compromise, Microsoft reports.\nThe campaign has been ongoing since at least August 2024, targeting entities in the government, IT, defense, telecoms, health, education, and energy sectors, as well as NGOs in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and North America.\n\n\n\nRelying on a numeric or alphanumeric code, the device code authentication flow is used to authenticate an account from a device that cannot perform an interactive authentication.\n\n\n\nAs part of a device code phishing attack, the threat actor asks the targeted service to generate a device code and convinces the victim to enter that code on a legitimate sign-in page. The targeted service then generates an access token that the attacker can recover and abuse to access the target’s accounts and data.\n\n\n\n\nThe threat actor can use the tokens to access email and cloud storage services that the victim has permissions to, without a password, and to move laterally.\n\n\n\n“This technique could enable persistent access as long as the tokens remain valid, making this attack technique attractive to threat actors,” Microsoft notes.\n\n\n\nAs part of the observed attacks, Storm-2372, described by Microsoft as a Russian state-sponsored threat actor, crafted phishing emails containing fake Microsoft Teams meeting invitations designed to steal the victims’ authenticated sessions by convincing them to complete device code authentication requests.\n\n\n\n“Storm-2372 likely targeted potential victims using third-party messaging services including WhatsApp, Signal, and Microsoft Teams, falsely posing as a prominent person relevant to the target to develop rapport before sending subsequent invitations to online events or meetings via phishing emails,” Microsoft notes.\n\n\n\nAfter successfully obtaining an authentication token, the threat actor would access the victim’s account and abuse it to send additional device code phishing messages to other users within the organization, Microsoft says.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nStorm-2372 was also seen using Microsoft Graph to search the victims’ inboxes for messages “containing words such as username, password, admin, teamviewer, anydesk, credentials, secret, ministry, and gov”, and to exfiltrate any email found in these searches.\n\n\n\nStarting February 13, the threat actor switched to using the specific client ID for Microsoft Authentication Broker in the device code authentication flow, enabling them to receive a refresh token they could use to obtain another token to register their own devices with Entra ID.\n\n\n\n“With the same refresh token and the new device identity, Storm-2372 is able to obtain a Primary Refresh Token (PRT) and access an organization’s resources. We have observed Storm-2372 using the connected device to collect emails. The actor has also been observed to use proxies that are regionally appropriate for the targets, likely in an attempt to further conceal the suspicious sign in activity,” Microsoft notes.\n\n\n\nAccording to cybersecurity firm Volexity, the device code phishing technique has been used in attacks targeting the US State Department, Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, European Union Parliament, and various research institutions since January 2025. \n\n\n\nVolexity identified three other Russia-linked threat actors employing the technique, namely CozyLarch (also tracked as APT29, Cozy Bear, and Midnight Blizzard), UTA0304, and UTA0307, but says that it is possible that a single threat actor is responsible for the attacks.\n\n\n\nRelated: Russian Cyberspies Caught Spear-Phishing with QR Codes, WhatsApp Groups\nRelated: PayPal Phishing Campaign Employs Genuine Links to Take Over Accounts\nRelated: Organizations Warned of Rise in Okta Support Phishing Attacks\nRelated: Businesses Worldwide Targeted in Large-Scale ChatGPT Phishing Campaign\n\nThe campaign has been ongoing since at least August 2024, targeting entities in the government, IT, defense, telecoms, health, education, and energy sectors, as well as NGOs in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and North America.\n\n\n\nRelying on a numeric or alphanumeric code, the device code authentication flow is used to authenticate an account from a device that cannot perform an interactive authentication.\n\n\n\nAs part of a device code phishing attack, the threat actor asks the targeted service to generate a device code and convinces the victim to enter that code on a legitimate sign-in page.

This attack requires access to the MFP printer admin account, and LDAP services must have been configured for normal operation to a valid LDAP server,” Rapid7 explains.\n\n\n\nTo capture the SMB or FTP authentication credentials, the attacker would need access to the user address book configuration, where they need to modify the SMB or FTP server’s IP address to point to a server they control.\n\n\n\n“This attack allows a malicious actor to capture NetNTLMV2 handshakes or leverage the vulnerability in an SMB relay attack against Active Directory file servers. In the case of FTP, the malicious actor would be able to capture clear text FTP authentication credentials,” Rapid7 says.\n\n\n\nSuch an attack can be mounted if an SMB or FTP scan function is configured in the user’s address book, and if the attacker either has physical access to the printer console or remote access via the web interface, which may require administrative credentials.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“If a malicious actor can successfully leverage these issues, it would allow them to capture credentials for Windows Active Directory. This means they could then move laterally within an organization’s environment and compromise other critical Windows servers and file systems,” Rapid7 notes.\n\n\n\nThe two issues were reported to Xerox in March 2024. Fixes for them were rolled out at the end of January 2025, in the form of service pack updates for the VersaLink C7020, 7025, and 7030 series multifunction printers.\n\n\n\nOrganizations are advised to update their VersaLink printers to firmware version 57.75.53 as soon as possible.
