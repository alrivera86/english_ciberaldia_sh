        "Content": "Apple is removing its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for iCloud from the United Kingdom with immediate effect following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data.\nThe development was\nfirst reported\nby Bloomberg.\nADP for iCloud is an\noptional setting\nthat ensures that users' trusted devices retain sole access to the encryption keys used to unlock data stored in its cloud. This includes iCloud Backup, Photos, Notes, Reminders, Safari Bookmarks, voice memos, and data associated with its own apps.\n\"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,\" the company was quoted as saying to Bloomberg.\n\"ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices.\"\nCustomers who are already using ADP will need to manually disable it for an as-yet-unspecified period of time, per the report, as Apple \"does not have the ability to automatically disable it on their behalf.\"\nThe unprecedented development comes merely weeks after reports\nemerged\nthat the U.K. government had ordered Apple to build a backdoor to access any Apple user's iCloud content.\nPer The Washington Post, the demand, issued by the U.K. Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act (\nIPA\n) aka the Snoopers' Charter, \"requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account.\"\nWith the removal of ADP in the region, Apple now only offers standard data protection for iCloud, which encrypts users' data but stores the encryption keys in its own data centers, thereby making it accessible to law enforcement subject to a warrant.\nLast week, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Member of Congress Andy Biggs\nsent\na letter to Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, urging the U.K. to retract its order, citing it threatens the privacy and security of both the American people and the U.S. government.\n\"If the U.K. does not immediately reverse this dangerous effort, we urge you to reevaluate U.S.-U.K. cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as U.S. intelligence sharing with the U.K.,\" they added.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "An analysis of a data leak from a Chinese cybersecurity company TopSec has revealed that it likely offers censorship-as-a-service solutions to prospective customers, including a state-owned enterprise in the country.\nFounded in 1995, TopSec ostensibly offers services such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and vulnerability scanning. But it's also providing \"boutique\" solutions in order to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements, SentinelOne researchers Alex Delamotte and Aleksandar Milenkoski\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe data leak contains infrastructure details and work logs from employees, as well as references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers.\nIt's believed that the company provided bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise hit by a corruption scandal, indicating that such platforms are being used to monitor and control public opinion as necessary.\nPresent among the data leak is a contract for a \"Cloud Monitoring Service Project\" announced by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau in September 2024.\nThe project, the document reveals, involves continuous monitoring of websites within the Bureau's jurisdiction with the goal of identifying security issues and content changes, and providing incident alerts.\nSpecifically, the platform has been designed to look for the presence of hidden links in web content, along with those containing\nsensitive words\nrelated to political criticism, violence, or pornography.\nWhile the exact goals are unclear, it's suspected that such alerts could be used by customers to take follow-on actions, such as issuing warnings, deleting content, or restricting access when sensitive words are detected. That said, Shanghai Anheng Smart City Security Technology Co. Ltd. won the contract, per public documents analyzed by SentinelOne.\nThe cybersecurity firm said the leak was detected after it analyzed a text file that was\nuploaded\nto the VirusTotal platform on January 24, 2025. The manner in which the data was leaked remains unclear.\n\"The main file we analyzed contains numerous work logs, which are a description of the work performed by a TopSec employee and the amount of time the task took, often accompanied by scripts, commands, or data related to the task,\" the researchers noted.\n\"In addition to work logs, the leak contains many commands and playbooks used to administrate TopSec's services via multiple common DevOps and infrastructure technologies that are used worldwide, including Ansible, Docker, ElasticSearch, Gitlab, Kafka, Kibana, Kubernetes, and Redis.\"\nAlso found are references to another framework named Sparta (or Sparda) that's supposedly designed to handle sensitive word processing by receiving content from downstream web applications via GraphQL APIs, once again suggestive of censorship keyword monitoring.\n\"These leaks yield insight into the complex ecosystem of relationships between government entities and China's private sector cybersecurity companies,\" the researchers said.\n\"While many countries have significant overlap between government requirements and private sector cybersecurity firms, the ties between these entities in China are much deeper and represent the state's grasp on managing public opinion through online enforcement.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Using darcula-suite, you can complete the production of a front-end in 10 minutes.\"\nTo do this, all a customer has to do is provide the URL of the brand to be impersonated in a web interface, with the platform employing a browser automation tool like Puppeteer to export the HTML and all required assets.\nUsers can then select the HTML element to replace and inject the phishing content (e.g., payment forms and login fields) such that it matches the look and feel of the branded landing page. The generated phishing page is then uploaded to an admin panel.\n\"Like any Software-as-a-Service product, the darcula-suite PhaaS platform provides admin dashboards that make it simple for fraudsters to manage their various campaigns,\" security researcher Harry Freeborough said.\n\"Once generated, these kits are uploaded to another platform where criminals can manage their active campaigns, find extracted data, and monitor their deployed phishing campaigns.\"\nBesides featuring dashboards that highlight the aggregated performance statistics of the phishing campaigns, Darcula v3 goes a step further by offering a way to convert the stolen credit card details into a virtual image of the victim's card that can be\nscanned and added to a digital wallet\nfor illicit purposes. Specifically, the cards are loaded onto burner phones and sold to other criminals.\nThe tool is said to be currently in the internal testing stage.

        "Content": "Wherever there’s been conflict in the world, propaganda has never been far away. Travel back in time to 515 BC and read the Behistun Inscription, an autobiography by Persian King Darius that discusses his rise to power. More recently, see how different newspapers report on wars, where it’s said, ‘The first casualty is the truth.’\nWhile these forms of communication could shape people’s beliefs, they also carry limitations around scalability. Any messaging and propaganda would often lose its power after traveling a certain distance. Of course, with social media and the online world there are few physical limits on reach, apart from where someone’s internet connection drops. Add in the rise of AI, and there’s also nothing to stop the scalability either.\nThis article explores what this means for societies and organizations facing\nAI-powered information manipulation\nand deception.\nThe rise of the echo chamber\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, around one-in-five Americans get their news from social media. In Europe, there’s been an\n11% rise in people using social media platforms to access news\n. AI algorithms are at the heart of this behavioral shift. However, they aren’t compelled to present both sides of a story, in the way that journalists are trained to, and that media regulators require. With fewer restrictions, social media platforms can focus on serving up content that their users like, want, and react to.\nThis focus on maintaining eyeballs can lead to a digital echo chamber, and potentially polarized viewpoints. For example, people can block opinions they disagree with, while the algorithm automatically adjusts user feeds, even monitoring scrolling speed, to boost consumption. If consumers only see content that they agree with, they’re reaching a consensus with what AI is showing them, but not the wider world.\nWhat’s more, more of that content is now being generated synthetically using AI tools. This includes over 1,150 unreliable AI-generated news websites recently identified by NewsGuard, a company specializing in information reliability. With few limitations to AI’s output capability, long-standing political processes are feeling the impact.\nHow AI is being deployed for deception\nIt’s fair to say that we humans are unpredictable. Our multiple biases and countless contradictions play out in each of our brains constantly. Where billions of neurons make new connections that shape realities and in turn, our opinions. When malicious actors add AI to this potent mix, this leads to events such as:\nDeepfake videos spreading during the US election:\nAI tools allow cybercriminals to create fake footage, featuring people moving and talking, using just text prompts. The high levels of ease and speed mean no technical expertise is needed to create realistic AI-powered footage. This democratization threatens democratic processes, as shown in the run-up to the recent US election. Microsoft highlighted activity from China and Russia, where ‘threat actors were observed integrating generative AI into their US election influence efforts.’\nVoice cloning and what political figures say:\nAttackers can now use AI to copy anyone’s voice, simply by processing a few seconds of their speech.\nThat’s what happened to a Slovakian politician in 2023\n. A fake audio recording spread online, supposedly featuring Michal Simecka discussing with a journalist how to fix an upcoming election. While the discussion was soon found to be fake, this all happened just a few days before polling began. Some voters may have cast their vote while believing the AI video was genuine.\nLLMs faking public sentiment:\nAdversaries can now communicate as many languages as their chosen LLM, and at any scale too. Back in 2020, an early LLM, GPT-3, was trained to write thousands of emails to US state legislators. These advocated a mix of issues from the left and right of the political spectrum. About 35,000 emails were sent, a mix of human-written and AI-written. Legislator response rates ‘were statistically indistinguishable’ on three issues raised.\nAI’s impact on democratic processes\nIt’s still possible to identify many AI-powered deceptions. Whether that’s from a glitchy frame in a video, or a mispronounced word in a speech. However, as technology progresses, it’s going to become harder, even impossible to separate fact from fiction.\nFact-checkers may be able to attach follow-ups to fake social media posts. Websites such as Snopes can continue debunking conspiracy theories. However, there’s no way to make sure these get seen by everyone who saw the original posts. It’s also pretty much impossible to find the original source of fake material, due to the number of distribution channels available.\nPace of evolution\nSeeing (or hearing) is believing. I’ll believe it when I see it. Show me, don’t tell me. All these phrases are based on human’s evolutionary understanding of the world. Namely, that we choose to trust our eyes and ears.\nThese senses have evolved over hundreds, even millions of years. Whereas ChatGPT was released publicly in November 2022. Our brains can’t adapt at the speed of AI, so if people can no longer trust what’s in front of them, it’s time to educate everyone’s eyes, ears, and minds.\nOtherwise, this leaves organizations wide open to attack. After all, work is often where people spend most time at a computer. This means equipping workforces with awareness, knowledge, and skepticism when faced with content engineered to generate action. Whether that contains political messaging at election time, or asking an employee to bypass procedures and make a payment to an unverified bank account.\nIt means making societies aware of the many ways malicious actors play on natural biases, emotions, and instincts to believe what someone is saying. These play out in multiple social engineering attacks, including phishing (‘the number one internet crime type’ according to the FBI).\nAnd it means supporting individuals to know when to pause, reflect, and challenge what they see online. One way is to simulate an AI-powered attack, so they gain first-hand experience of how it feels and what to look out for. Humans shape society, they just need help to defend themselves, organizations, and communities against AI-powered deception.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Cisco has confirmed that a Chinese threat actor known as Salt Typhoon gained access by likely abusing a known security flaw tracked as\nCVE-2018-0171\n, and by obtaining legitimate victim login credentials as part of a targeted campaign aimed at major U.S. telecommunications companies.\n\"The threat actor then demonstrated their ability to persist in target environments across equipment from multiple vendors for extended periods, maintaining access in one instance for over three years,\" Cisco Talos\nsaid\n, describing the hackers as highly sophisticated and well-funded.\n\"The long timeline of this campaign suggests a high degree of coordination, planning, and patience — standard hallmarks of advanced persistent threat (APT) and state-sponsored actors.\"\nThe networking equipment major said it found no evidence that other known security bugs have been weaponized by the hacking crew, contrary to a recent report from Recorded Future that\nrevealed\nexploitation attempts involving flaws tracked as CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to infiltrate networks.\nAn important aspect of the campaign is the use of valid, stolen credentials to gain initial access, although the manner in which they are acquired is unknown at this stage. The threat actor has also been observed making efforts to get hold of credentials via network device configurations and deciphering local accounts with weak password types.\n\"In addition, we have observed the threat actor capturing SNMP, TACACS, and RADIUS traffic, including the secret keys used between network devices and TACACS/RADIUS servers,\" Talos noted. \"The intent of this traffic capture is almost certainly to enumerate additional credential details for follow-on use.\"\nAnother noteworthy behavior exhibited by Salt Typhoon entails leveraging living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques on network devices, abusing the trusted infrastructure as pivot points to jump from one telecom to another.\nIt's suspected that these devices are being used as intermediate relays to reach the intended final target or as a first hop for outbound data exfiltration operations, as it offers a way for the adversary to remain undetected for extended periods of time.\nFurthermore, Salt Typhoon has been spotted altering network configurations to create local accounts, enable Guest Shell access, and facilitate remote access via SSH. Also put to use is a bespoke utility named JumbledPath that allows them to execute a packet capture on a remote Cisco device through an actor-defined jump-host.\nThe Go-based ELF binary is also capable of clearing logs and disabling logging in an attempt to obfuscate traces of the malicious activity and make forensic analysis more difficult. This is supplemented by periodic steps undertaken to erase relevant logs, including .bash_history, auth.log, lastlog, wtmp, and btmp, where applicable.\n\"The use of this utility would help to obfuscate the original source, and ultimate destination, of the request and would also allow its operator to move through potentially otherwise non-publicly-reachable (or routable) devices or infrastructure,\" Cisco noted.\n\"The threat actor repeatedly modified the address of the loopback interface on a compromised switch and used that interface as the source of SSH connections to additional devices within the target environment, allowing them to effectively bypass access control lists (ACLs) in place on those devices.\"\nThe company said it also identified \"additional pervasive targeting\" of Cisco devices with exposed Smart Install (SMI), followed by the exploitation of CVE-2018-0171. The activity, it pointed out, is unrelated to Salt Typhoon and does not share overlaps with any known threat actor or group.\nFound this article interesting?

The researchers say they also discovered additional malicious APKs that appear to be variants of the same malware campaign, namely KreditApple, PokketMe, and StashFur.\nAlthough the app has now been removed from Google Play, it may continue to run in the background, collecting sensitive information from infected devices.\nMalicious app on Google Play\nSource: BleepingComputer\nMultiple user reviews for Finance Simplified on Google Play show that the app offers lending services that attempt to extort borrowers if they don't pay high interest rates.\n\"Very very very bad app they given low loan amount nd black mail to pay High otherwise photoes edited as a nude nd black mailing,\" reads a user review for the now-pulled app.\nThe apps also claim to be registered Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), which CYFIRMA says is untrue.\nTo evade detection on Google Play, Finance Simplified loads a WebView to redirect users to an external website from where they download a loan app APK hosted on an Amazon EC2 server.\n\"The Finance Simplified app appears to target Indian users specifically by displaying and recommending loan applications, loading a WebView that shows a loan service that redirects to an external website where a separate loan APK file is downloaded,\"\nexplains CYFIRMA\n.\nThe researchers discovered that the app will only load the deceptive interface if the user location is India, which shows the campaign has a specific targeting.\nDevice location is India (left) and any other place (right)\nSource: CYFIRMA\nSensitive data stolen by app\nThe more worrying aspect of the malware's activity is the data collection, which includes sensitive personal information stored on the user's device.\nHere's a summary of the data the malware steals:\nContacts, call logs, SMS messages, and device details.\nPhotos, videos, and documents from internal and external storage.\nLive location tracking (updated every 3 seconds), historical location data, and IP address.\nLast 20 text entries copied to the clipboard.\nLoan history and banking SMS transaction messages.\nAlthough that data is primarily used for extorting the victims who made the mistake of applying for a loan, it may also be used for financial fraud or resold to cybercriminals for profit.\nOverview of SpyLend's operation\nSource: CYFIRMA\nIf you suspect your device was infected by any of the mentioned apps or similar, remove them immediately, reset permissions, change banking account passwords, and perform a device scan.\nGoogle's Play Protect tool detects and blocks known malware and predatory apps, so ensure it's active on your device.\nRelated Articles:\nCrypto-stealing apps found in Apple App Store for the first time\nGoogle blocked 2.36 million risky Android apps from Play Store in 2024\nNew Android Identity Check locks settings outside trusted locations\nNew FireScam Android data-theft malware poses as Telegram Premium app\nBadBox malware botnet infects 192,000 Android devices despite disruption"

Unfortunately, this transaction was manipulated through a sophisticated attack that masked the signing interface, displaying the correct address while altering the underlying smart contract logic,\"\nBybit explained\n.\n\"As a result, the attacker was able to gain control of the affected ETH cold wallet and transfer its holdings to an unidentified address.\"\nThe crypto exchange says its security team is now investigating the incident with the help of external blockchain forensic experts. According to Bybit, anyone with the expertise to help track the stolen funds is also welcome to assist.\nBybit says all other cold wallets are fully secure, client funds are safe, and exchange operations were undisrupted by the incident.\n\"Please rest assured that all other cold wallets are secure. I will keep you guys posted as more develops, If any team can help us to track the stolen fund will be appreciated,\" Bybit's CEO\nsaid\n.\n\"Bybit is Solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered, all of clients assets are 1 to 1 backed, we can cover the loss.\"\nAccording to crypto fraud investigator ZachXBT, the exploiter has already\nsplit\n10,000 ETH out of the\nroughly 401,346 ETH stolen in the attack\nto 48 addresses.\nLargest crypto hack in history\nWith\n$1.46 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in a single attack\n, this is now the largest cryptocurrency hack ever, almost doubling the previous record.\nIn March 2022, Sky Mavis disclosed that attackers\nstole $620 million\nin cryptocurrency (173,600 Ethereum and 25.5M USDC tokens) from Axie Infinity's Ronin network bridge. In April 2022, the FBI\nlinked that incident\nto two North Korean hacking groups, Lazarus and BlueNorOff (aka APT38).\nOne year earlier, in August 2021, a threat actor\nstole $611 million\nin Binance Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon assets from decentralized cross-chain protocol and network Poly Network.\nThe United States, South Korea, and Japan said in January that North Korean state-backed hacking groups\nstole over $659 million worth of cryptocurrency\nlast year.\nHowever, one month earlier, blockchain analysis company Chainalysis painted a more dire picture, saying North Korean hackers\nstole $1.34 billion in cryptocurrency in 47 cyberattacks\nthroughout 2024, breaking their previous record of $1.1 billion from 2022.\nRelated Articles:\nzkLend loses $9.5M in crypto heist, asks hacker to return 90%\nCrypto-stealing apps found in Apple App Store for the first time\nKuCoin to pay nearly $300 million in penalties after guilty plea\nSolana Pump.fun tool DogWifTool compromised to drain wallets\nHackers steal $85 million worth of cryptocurrency from Phemex"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nApple says it can no longer offer end-to-end encrypted cloud backups in the UK and insists it will never build a backdoor or master key.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nApple has pulled its privacy-themed Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature from new users in the United Kingdom, a move clearly linked to UK government demands for a backdoor into encrypted cloud storage. \n“Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature,” Cupertino said in a brief statement.\n\n\n\nThe company did not explicitly say why it removed a crucial feature that protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, but said it was “gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.”\n\n\n\n“As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” Apple declared.\n\n\n\nThis wording provides a hint that the move is linked to a secret order from British authorities for Apple to provide blanket access to all encrypted content stored in iCloud — a request that would force the company to undermine its longstanding privacy protections. The UK order was first reported by the Washington Post.\nThe change means that while current UK users who have enabled ADP will eventually need to disable the feature to keep their iCloud accounts active, new customers in the region will only have access to Standard Data Protection. ADP, which offers end-to-end encryption for a wide range of iCloud data, now remains available only in markets outside the UK.\n\n\n\nStarting Friday, Apple said, UK customers attempting to access ADP will encounter a user interface message stating, “Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users.” \nThe company stressed that while the withdrawal affects nine iCloud data categories—such as iCloud Backup, iCloud Drive, Photos, and Notes—the 14 categories that are encrypted by default, including iCloud Keychain and Health data, remain protected.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nApple said it cannot disable ADP automatically for these users. Instead, UK users will be given a period of time to disable the feature themselves to keep using their iCloud account.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Data Protection for iCloud is pitched as Apple’s highest level of cloud data security that protects the majority of iCloud data using end-to-end encryption. \n\n\n\nIt is an optional setting that comes with a promise that “no one else can access your end-to-end encrypted data, not even Apple, and this data remains secure even in the case of a data breach in the cloud“. \n\n\n\nRelated: Apple Fixes “Backdoors” With Release of iOS 8\nRelated: Apple Backs Panel to Consider Encryption Compromise\nRelated: Industry Reactions to FBI’s Request for iPhone Backdoor\nRelated: Encryption Battle Reignited as US Govt at Loggerheads With Apple\n\n“Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature,” Cupertino said in a brief statement.\n\n\n\nThe company did not explicitly say why it removed a crucial feature that protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, but said it was “gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.”\n\n\n\n“As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” Apple declared.\n\n\n\nThis wording provides a hint that the move is linked to a secret order from British authorities for Apple to provide blanket access to all encrypted content stored in iCloud — a request that would force the company to undermine its longstanding privacy protections.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nCisco Talos observed Chinese hackers pivoting from a compromised device operated by one telecom to target a device in another telecom.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nResearchers in Cisco’s threat intelligence unit say the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group Salt Typhoon successfully broke into US telco networks via old, unpatched vulnerabilities, stolen login credentials and basic ‘living-off-the-land’ (LOTL) tactics.\nA fresh report from the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group provides official confirmation that in at least one incident Salt Typhoon exploited CVE-2018-0171, a remote code execution vulnerability in Cisco’s Smart Install feature. This flaw was patched in 2018, but unpatched legacy systems remain at risk.\n\n\n\nWhile there have been reports of Salt Typhoon abusing other Cisco vulnerabilities, the Talos researchers say they have not yet found evidence confirming additional exploit activity.\n\n\n\n“No new Cisco vulnerabilities were discovered during this campaign. While there have been some reports that Salt Typhoon is abusing three other known Cisco vulnerabilities, we have not identified any evidence to confirm these claims,” the company declared.\n\n\n\nStill, the company is calling urgent attention to patches for multiple known security flaws reportedly exploited by Salt Typhoon:\n\n\n\n\nCVE-2018-0171 — Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Smart Install Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (Last Updated: 15-Dec-2022)\nCVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273 — Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Feature (Last Updated: 1-Nov-2023)\nCVE-2024-20399 – Cisco NX-OS Software CLI Command Injection Vulnerability (Last Updated: 17-Sep-2024)\n\nSalt Typhoon has compromised core network infrastructure across multiple telecom firms, using a mix of credential theft, LOTL tactics, and infrastructure pivoting to evade detection.\n\n\n\nThe new Cisco Talos documentation makes it clear that Salt Typhoon hackers primarily gained access to networking equipment using valid login credentials. \n\n\n\nWhile the exact method of obtaining these credentials remains unclear, the attackers were seen capturing network traffic to steal SNMP, TACACS, and RADIUS credentials. \n\n\n\n“In numerous instances, the threat actor exfiltrated device configurations, often over TFTP and/or FTP. These configurations often contained sensitive authentication material, such as SNMP Read/Write (R/W) community strings and local accounts with weak password encryption types in use. The weak encryption password type would allow an attacker to trivially decrypt the password itself offline,” Cisco Talos explained.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThe research team also noted the extensive use of LOTL techniques, piggybacking on built-in networking features rather than deploying traditional malware. The attackers modified router configurations, altered authentication settings, and used guest shell environments on Cisco Nexus devices to execute commands stealthily. \n\n\n\nIn multiple instances, the Cisco Talos team observed the hackers pivoting between compromised telecom networks, using one company’s infrastructure as a jumping point to attack another. \n\n\n\n“A significant part of this campaign is marked by the actor’s continued movement, or pivoting, through compromised infrastructure,” the research team explained. “This ‘machine to machine’ pivoting, or ‘jumping’ allows the threat actor to move within a trusted infrastructure set where network communications might not otherwise be permitted.”“Additionally, connections from this type of infrastructure are less likely to be flagged as suspicious by network defenders, allowing the threat actor to remain undetected,” the team added.\n\n\n\n“The threat actor also pivoted from a compromised device operated by one telecom to target a device in another telecom,” Cisco Talos noted. \n\n\n\nIt added, “We believe that the device associated with the initial telecom was merely used as a hop point and not the intended final target in several instances. Some of these hop points were also used as a first hop for outbound data exfiltration operations. Much of this pivoting included the use of network equipment from a variety of different manufacturers.”\n\n\n\nWhile Salt Typhoon exploited vulnerabilities in Cisco devices, there is no evidence to suggest that Cisco’s own corporate infrastructure was compromised, the researchers said, stressing that the attacks were directed at devices operated by the targeted telecommunications companies. \n\n\n\nRelated: Salt Typhoon Targeting Old Cisco Flaws in Fresh Telecom Hacks\nRelated: US Gov: Limit Phone Use After China ‘Salt Typhoon’ Hack\nRelated: China’s Salt Typhoon Hacked AT&T, Verizon \n\n\n\nRelated: Cisco Warns of Many Old Vulnerabilities Being Exploited in Attacks\nRelated: US Details Chinese Attacks Against Telecoms Providers \n\t\t\t\nA fresh report from the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group provides official confirmation that in at least one incident Salt Typhoon exploited CVE-2018-0171, a remote code execution vulnerability in Cisco’s Smart Install feature.

These configurations often contained sensitive authentication material, such as SNMP Read/Write (R/W) community strings and local accounts with weak password encryption types in use. The weak encryption password type would allow an attacker to trivially decrypt the password itself offline,” Cisco Talos explained.Advertisement.

The company has found evidence that infostealers have taken data from devices belonging to contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Honeywell , US Army and Navy personnel, and the FBI. Sensitive data stolen from these systems can be acquired by anyone for as little as $10.\n\n\n\nUS Army soldier arrested for AT&T and Verizon hacks pleads guilty\nUS soldier Cameron John Wagenius, arrested and charged recently over AT&T and Verizon hacking, has pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records information, and faces up to 10 years of prison for each count. He was recently also linked to the Snowflake hack. \n\n\n\nSEC launches new cyber unit\nThe SEC has announced the launch of a new unit called the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU), which focuses on combating cyber-related misconduct and protecting investors from bad actors. Roughly 30 fraud specialists and attorneys across multiple SEC offices are members of the CETU, which replaces the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.\n\n\n\nBlack Basta chat logs leaked\nChat logs belonging to the notorious Black Basta ransomware group have been leaked amid reports that the gang is falling apart due to internal conflicts. The leaked chats expose information on the group’s members, as well as their tools.\n\n\n\nGenea cyberattack\nAustralian IVF giant Genea has launched an investigation after detecting a cyberattack. The attackers are believed to have accessed data and the extent of the breach is being assessed. Some systems and servers were taken offline, which could suggest that Genea was targeted in a ransomware attack, but no known ransomware group has taken credit for the attack as of February 21. \n\n\n\nZhong Stealer targets cryptocurrency and fintech sectors\nAn information-stealer malware named Zhong Stealer has been used in a campaign targeting the cryptocurrency and fintech sectors, according to an analysis conducted by Any.run. The attackers targeted chat support platforms such as Zendesk and posed as customers to trick support agents into downloading the malware. \n\n\n\nCode security open source tools from Apiiro\nApiiro has released two open source tools designed to help security and engineering teams detect and prevent malicious code in the development lifecycle.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nOPSWAT details two critical vulnerabilities in the Mongoose ODM library for MongoDB leading to remote code execution on the Node.js server.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nTwo critical-severity vulnerabilities in the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB could have allowed attackers to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the Node.js application server, cybersecurity platform OPSWAT reports.\nWidely adopted in production environments, Mongoose enables the mapping of JavaScript objects to MongoDB documents, leading to easier data management and validation. However, the function that improves working with relationships between documents could be exploited for RCE.\n\n\n\nThe first of the critical-severity flaws in the library, tracked as CVE-2024-53900, could allow an attacker to exploit the $where value to potentially achieve RCE on Node.js. The second issue, tracked as CVE-2025-23061, is a bypass for CVE-2024-53900’s patch.\n\n\n\nAs OPSWAT explains, $where is a MongoDB query operator that enables the execution of JavaScript directly on the MongoDB server, but with certain limitations.\n\n\n\nWhen processing retrieved data, one of Mongoose’s functions would pass the $where value to a function imported from an external library, which would process the queries locally on the application server, without performing input validation.\n\n\n\n“This lack of input validation and restriction introduces a significant security vulnerability, as the ‘params’ value- directly controlled by user input – can be exploited, potentially leading to code injection attacks,” OPSWAT notes.\n\n\n\nThe patch for CVE-2024-53900 added a check to disallow passing the $where operator to the vulnerable function, thus preventing the execution of malicious payloads.\n\n\n\nHowever, the patch could be bypassed by embedding the $where operator in the $or operator supported by both MongoDB and the vulnerable function.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“As a result, an attacker can nest $where under $or to evade the patch’s single-level check. Because Mongoose inspects only the top-level properties of each object in the match array, the bypass payload remains undetected and eventually reaches the sift library, enabling the malicious RCE,” OPSWAT notes.\n\n\n\nThe cybersecurity organization has released proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code targeting both vulnerabilities and recommends updating Mongoose to version 8.9.5 or later, which contain complete patches for the two bugs.\n\n\n\nRelated: Atlassian Patches Critical Vulnerabilities in Confluence, Crowd\nRelated: OpenSSH Patches Vulnerabilities Allowing MitM, DoS Attacks\nRelated: Chrome 133, Firefox 135 Updates Patch High-Severity Vulnerabilities\nRelated: Critical Vulnerability Patched in Juniper Session Smart Router\n\nWidely adopted in production environments, Mongoose enables the mapping of JavaScript objects to MongoDB documents, leading to easier data management and validation.

In total, 23 of the uncovered tools “had around 97% similarity to the tools in the Shadow Brokers leak”, Lau explains.\n\n\n\nThe reports also show that the NSA exploited zero-days to hack the university, using 54 jump servers and 5 proxy servers in the attack, and employing a proprietary tool called Shaver to target SunOS-exposed systems.\n\n\n\nMan-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, phishing emails, and the FoxAcid zero-day vulnerability attack platform were also used in the attack, along with Island (for manual exploitation of Solaris systems) and the SecondDate espionage framework, which supports traffic hijacking, network eavesdropping, and code injection.\n\n\n\nThe platform was allegedly used to hijack internal hosts and servers and deploy additional tools to gain remote access to core network equipment, servers, and terminals.\n\n\n\nFor long-term persistence and lateral movement, the attackers allegedly used tools such as SecondDate, NoPen, Flame Spray, Cunning Heretics, and Stoic Surgeon, legitimate credentials for firewalls, hijacked software update mechanisms, stolen SSH, Telnet, and Rlogin passwords, and compromised routers to hijack and manipulate traffic.\n\n\n\nAccording to the reports, “NSA operatives allegedly systematically stole classified research data, network infrastructure details, and sensitive operational documents,” Lau notes.\n\n\n\nIt’s not uncommon for government hackers to make opsec mistakes that expose their identity and TTPs, but it’s also not uncommon for sophisticated threat actors to plant false flags that make attribution difficult. \n\n\n\nRelated: Chinese Researchers Detail Linux Backdoor of NSA-Linked Equation Group\nRelated: CISA, FBI Warn of China-Linked Ghost Ransomware Attacks\nRelated: FCC Taking Action in Response to China’s Telecoms Hacking\nRelated: US Updates a Science and Technology Pact With China to Reflect Growing Rivalry and Security Threats\n\nIn September 2022, China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) accused the NSA of tens of thousands of cyberattacks against networks in the country, and of infiltrating the Northwestern Polytechnical University.\n\n\n\nA year later, CVERC said it linked malware used in an April 2022 attack against the aerospace and defense institution to the NSA, and that it had uncovered the identities of the attackers.\n\n\n\nCVERC, however, was not the only Chinese entity to blame the NSA for the Northwestern Polytechnical University hack, and Australia-based researcher Lina Lau has dived into multiple reports to better understand the evidence behind the attribution.\n\n\n\nLau is the co-founder of Xintra, a company that provides advanced cybersecurity training solutions. \n\n\n\nWhile “the authenticity and extent of these allegations remain unverified by independent sources,” the reports paint a clear picture of the Chinese methodology of incident response, Lau notes.\n\n\n\nChina tracks the threat actor as APT-C-40, which Lau suggests is linked to the notorious Equation Group.\n\n\n\nAccording to the analyzed reports, the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations (TAO) division targeted the university for data theft and espionage, deploying at least 41 malware strains, and performing hands-on-keyboard operations.Advertisement.

The individual behind the post emphasized being the sole source of the data, allegedly ensuring its authenticity.\nThe threat actor insists that the dataset contains user information dating back to 2014, with the majority of accounts reportedly registered between 2024 and 2025. At the time of writing, there has been no official statement from Investing.com regarding the alleged breach.\nVarious threat actors published similar breaches time to time on different dark web forums.
