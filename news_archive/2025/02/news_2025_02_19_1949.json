Google said UAC-0195 partially overlaps with a hacking group known as\nUAC-0195\n.\nThese QR codes are known to masquerade as group invites, security alerts, or legitimate device pairing instructions from the Signal website. Alternatively, the malicious device-linking QR codes have been found to be embedded in phishing pages that purport to be specialized applications used by the Ukrainian military.\n\"UNC5792 has hosted modified Signal group invitations on actor-controlled infrastructure designed to appear identical to a legitimate Signal group invite,\" Google said.\nAnother threat actor linked to the targeting of Signal is UNC4221 (aka\nUAC-0185\n), which has targeted Signal accounts used by Ukrainian military personnel by means of a custom phishing kit that's designed to mimic certain aspects of the Kropyva application used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine for artillery guidance.\nAlso used is a lightweight JavaScript payload dubbed PINPOINT that can collect basic user information and geolocation data through phishing pages.\nOutside of UNC5792 and UNC4221, some of the other adversarial collectives that have trained their sights on Signal are Sandworm (aka APT44), which has utilized a Windows Batch script named WAVESIGN; Turla, which has operated a lightweight PowerShell script; and UNC1151, which has put to use the Robocopy utility to exfiltrate Signal messages from an infected desktop.\nThe disclosure from Google comes a little over a month after the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team\nattributed\nthe Russian threat actor known as Star Blizzard to a spear-phishing campaign that leverages a similar device-linking feature to hijack WhatsApp accounts.\nLast week, Microsoft and Volexity also\nrevealed\nthat multiple Russian threat actors are leveraging a technique called device code phishing to log into victims' accounts by targeting them via messaging apps like WhatsApp, Signal, and Microsoft Teams.\n\"The operational emphasis on Signal from multiple threat actors in recent months serves as an important warning for the growing threat to secure messaging applications that is certain to intensify in the near-term,\" Google said.\n\"As reflected in wide ranging efforts to compromise Signal accounts, this threat to secure messaging applications is not limited to remote cyber operations such as phishing and malware delivery, but also critically includes close-access operations where a threat actor can secure brief access to a target's unlocked device.\"\nThe disclosure also follows the discovery of a new search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning campaign that uses fake download pages impersonating popular applications like Signal, LINE, Gmail, and Google Translate to deliver backdoored executables aimed at Chinese-speaking users.\n\"The executables delivered through fake download pages follow a consistent execution pattern involving temporary file extraction, process injection, security modifications, and network communications,\" Hunt.io\nsaid\n, adding the samples exhibit infostealer-like functionality associated with a malware strain referred to as MicroClip.\nFound this article interesting?

In other words, the executable containing the malware is an AutoIt-compiled binary, thereby allowing it to bypass traditional detection mechanisms.\n\"The use of AutoIt not only complicates static analysis by embedding the payload within the compiled script but also enables dynamic behavior that mimics benign automation tools,\" Su added.\nOnce launched, Snake Keylogger is designed to drop a copy of itself to a file named \"ageless.exe\" in the folder \"%Local_AppData%\\supergroup.\" It also proceeds to drop another file called \"ageless.vbs\" in the Windows Startup folder such that the Visual Basic Script (VBS) automatically launches the malware every time the system is rebooted.\nThrough this persistence mechanism, Snake Keylogger is capable of maintaining access to the compromised system and resuming its malicious activities even if the associated process gets terminated.\nThe attack chain culminates with the injection of the main payload into a legitimate .NET process such as \"regsvcs.exe\" using a technique called process hollowing, permitting the malware to conceal its presence within a trusted process and sidestep detection.\nSnake Keylogger has also been found to log keystrokes and use websites like checkip.dyndns[.]org to retrieve the victim's IP address and geolocation.\n\"To capture keystrokes, it leverages the SetWindowsHookEx API with the first parameter set to WH_KEYBOARD_LL (flag 13), a low-level keyboard hook that monitors keystrokes,\" Su said. \"This technique allows the malware to log sensitive input such as banking credentials.\"\nThe development comes as CloudSEK detailed a campaign that's exploiting compromised infrastructure associated with educational institutions to distribute malicious LNK files disguised as PDF documents to ultimately deploy the\nLumma Stealer\nmalware.\nThe activity, targeting industries like finance, healthcare, technology, and media, is a multi-stage attack sequence that results in the theft of passwords, browser data, and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\"The campaign's primary infection vector involves using malicious LNK (shortcut) files that are crafted to appear as legitimate PDF documents,\" security researcher Mayank Sahariya\nsaid\n, adding the files are hosted on a WebDAV server that unsuspecting visitors are redirected to after visiting sites.\nThe LNK file, for its part, executes a PowerShell command to connect to a remote server and retrieve the next-stage malware, an obfuscated JavaScript code that harbors another PowerShell that downloads Lumma Stealer from the same server and executes it.\nIn recent weeks, stealer malware has also been observed distributed via\nobfuscated JavaScript files\nto harvest a wide range of sensitive data from compromised Windows systems and exfiltrate it to a Telegram bot operated by the attacker.\n\"The attack begins with an obfuscated JavaScript file, which fetches encoded strings from an open-source service to execute a PowerShell script,\" Cyfirma\nsaid\n.\n\"This script then downloads a JPG image and a text file from an IP address and a URL shortener, both of which contain malicious MZ DOS executables embedded using steganographic techniques.

        "Content": "The growing demand for cybersecurity and compliance services presents a great opportunity for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) to offer virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) services—delivering high-level cybersecurity leadership without the cost of a full-time hire.\nHowever, transitioning to vCISO services is not without its challenges. Many service providers struggle with structuring, pricing, and selling these services effectively. That's why we created\nthe Ultimate Guide to Structuring and Selling vCISO Services\n.\nThis guide, created in collaboration with Jesse Miller, a seasoned vCISO and founder of PowerPSA Consulting, offers actionable strategies to navigate these hurdles. From identifying what to offer and whom to target, to crafting compelling sales strategies, this resource provides a comprehensive roadmap for building a successful vCISO practice.\nWhere to Begin: What to Offer and to Whom\nThis guide outlines the key steps to successfully offering vCISO services, starting with existing capabilities and identifying the right clients.\nStep 1: Evaluate Current Offerings\nMany MSPs and MSSPs already provide elements of vCISO services without formalizing them. The guide helps you assess existing security activities and identify opportunities to package them into a complete vCISO service.\nStep 2: Assess Existing Clients\nNot every client is an ideal fit for vCISO services. The guide explains how to segment the client base by industry, size, and security maturity, ensuring efforts are focused on those who will benefit most. It also covers prioritization strategies to maximize revenue and create compelling value propositions.\nBy leveraging your existing relationships, vCISO services can efficiently meet previously unmet needs, allowing you to grow your revenue through targeted upselling. This approach enables you to maximize the potential of your current clients before focusing on attracting new clients.\nStep 3: Structure vCISO Services\nA structured approach ensures scalability and consistency. Using a matrix, analyze client needs based on security maturity and complexity, then package offerings accordingly:\nBasic:\nFoundational risk assessments, compliance assistance, and tactical security measures.\nStrategic:\nLong-term planning, board-level discussions, and compliance oversight.\nLeadership:\nExecutive-level oversight, acting as a fractional CISO for complex security needs.\nIdentifying a focus area within this matrix helps prioritize clients, such as developing vCISO packages for those in medium maturity and medium complexity. Standardizing services ensures a scalable system that delivers consistent results. Leveraging frameworks and automation streamlines sales, reduces complexity, and accelerates service delivery.\nFor a detailed matrix of potential service offerings, check out\nthe Ultimate Guide to Structuring and Selling vCISO Services\n.\nSelling vCISO Services\nScoping & Go-to-Market\nAs outlined in the guide, start by gathering key client information to determine fit and align services effectively.\nAssess Business Drivers:\nUnderstand the client's industry, goals, and major initiatives to ensure cybersecurity strategies support their objectives.\nEvaluate Readiness & Priorities:\nDetermine if the client has a real need for security leadership, compliance guidance, or risk management—and whether they are ready to invest in it.\nAvoid Misaligned Clients:\nWalk away from businesses that don't prioritize security to maintain strong partnerships and focus resources on high-value clients.\nTailor services based on these insights while setting clear expectations on scope, deliverables, and impact. Focus on\nhigh-value, strategic outcomes\nto build long-term trust and drive measurable results.\nElevate the Conversation: Key discovery questions to drive vCISO engagement\nWhen engaging with a client, focus on understanding their business goals, challenges, and why they need vCISO services. A business-centered conversation builds trust and ensures security is positioned as a strategic asset rather than a cost.\nKey discussion points:\nAlign cybersecurity with business success\nby framing it as a driver of resilience, compliance, and growth.\nHighlight legal and regulatory implications\nto address potential financial and reputational risks.\nEmphasize the cost of inaction\n, showing how proactive security is far more cost-effective than responding to a cyber incident.\nBy tailoring vCISO services to mitigate risk, support business objectives, and enhance long-term stability, clients will see cybersecurity as an essential investment rather than an overhead expense.\nKey Selling Points\nBuilding trust with clients requires demonstrating both technical expertise and business understanding to provide tailored security strategies.\nKey Benefits of vCISO Services:\nEnterprise-level security without full-time costs\nFlexible CISO options based on needs\nFaster compliance with regulations\nStreamlined cyber insurance fulfillment\nImmediate security posture improvements\nWays to Demonstrate Expertise:\nIndustry experience & testimonials to build credibility\nClear service offerings & deliverables to set expectations\nSupported security & compliance frameworks to establish trust\nExample reports & dashboards to show measurable progress\nAI-driven capabilities for enhanced efficiency and automation\nBy highlighting these strengths, MSPs and MSSPs can effectively position vCISO services as a trusted, strategic solution for clients.\nCosts of Offering vCISO Services\nWhile vCISO services can be a lucrative offering for MSPs and MSSPs, several hidden costs can impact profitability:\nSkilled Talent: Hiring and training cybersecurity experts in strategy, risk management, and compliance requires ongoing investment.\nTools & Software: Risk assessment, compliance tracking, and reporting tools come with licensing and maintenance costs.\nClient Education: Significant time and effort may be needed to help clients understand the value of vCISO services.\nManual Processes: Without automation, tasks like policy creation and risk assessments can be resource-intensive, increasing costs and potential errors.\nAddressing these challenges through strategic hiring, efficient tools, client education, and automation is essential for maintaining profitability and optimizing service delivery.\nThe Path to a Successful vCISO\nOffering vCISO services represents a transformative opportunity for MSPs and MSSPs to address the growing cybersecurity needs of businesses of all sizes while enhancing their own service portfolio and revenue streams\n.\nThis guide\nhas provided actionable steps to help service providers structure, sell, and scale vCISO offerings, from evaluating current capabilities and targeting the right clients to creating scalable, repeatable systems that ensure consistent results.\nBy leveraging tools like\nCynomi's AI-driven platform\nand frameworks such as PowerPSA's PowerGRYD system, MSPs and MSSPs can overcome common challenges like hidden costs and resource constraints. With a focus on client-centric solutions, strategic messaging, and automation, service providers can position themselves as trusted advisors, helping their clients achieve resilience and growth in an increasingly complex digital landscape.\nThe path to successful vCISO services starts here—empower your clients, grow your business, and make a lasting impact in the world of cybersecurity.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

It lasted for a month.\nTargets of the campaign include individuals and businesses worldwide, with Kaspersky's telemetry finding higher infection concentrations in Russia, Brazil, Germany, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.\n\"This approach helped the threat actors make the most out of the miner implant by targeting powerful gaming machines capable of sustaining mining activity,\" researchers Tatyana Shishkova and Kirill Korchemny\nsaid\nin an analysis published Tuesday.\nThe XMRig cryptocurrency miner campaign employs popular simulator and physics games like BeamNG.drive, Garry's Mod, Dyson Sphere Program, Universe Sandbox, and Plutocracy as lures to initiate a sophisticated attack chain.\nThis involves uploading poisoned game installers crafted using\nInno Setup\nonto various torrent sites in September 2024, indicating that the unidentified threat actors behind the campaign had carefully planned the attacks.\nUsers who end up downloading these releases, also called \"repacks\" are served an installer screen that urges them to proceed with the setup process, during which a dropper (\"unrar.dll\") is extracted and executed.\nThe DLL file continues its execution only after running a series of checks to determine if it's running in a debugging or sandboxed environment, a demonstration of its highly evasive behavior.\nSubsequently, it polls various sites like api.myip [.]com, ip-api [.]com, and ipwho [.]is to obtain the user's IP address and estimate their location. If it fails in this step, the country is defaulted to China or Belarus for reasons that are not wholly clear.\nThe next phase entails gathering a fingerprint of the machine, decrypting another executable (\"MTX64.exe\"), and writing its contents to a file on disk named \"Windows.Graphics.ThumbnailHandler.dll\" in either the %SystemRoot% or %SystemRoot%\\Sysnative folder.\nBased on a legitimate open-source project called\nEpubShellExtThumbnailHandler\n, MTX64 modifies the Windows Shell Extension Thumbnail Handler functionality for its own gain by loading a next-stage payload, a portable executable named Kickstarter that then unpacks an encrypted blob embedded within it.\nThe blob, like in the previous step, is written to disk under the name \"Unix.Directory.IconHandler.dll\" in the folder %appdata\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Credentials\\%InstallDate%\\.\nThe newly created DLL is configured to retrieve the final-stage binary from a remote server that's responsible for running the miner implant, while also continuously checking for taskmgr.exe and procmon.exe in the list of running processes. The artifact is promptly terminated if any of the processes are detected.\nThe miner is a slightly tweaked version of XMRig that uses a predefined command line to initiate the mining process on machines with CPUs that have 8 or more cores.\n\"If there are fewer than 8, the miner does not start,\" the researchers said. \"Moreover, the attacker chose to host a mining pool server in their own infrastructure instead of using a public one.\"\n\"XMRig parses the constructed command line using its built-in functionality. The miner also creates a separate thread to check for process monitors running in the system, using the same method as in the previous stage.\"\nStaryDobry remains unattributed given the lack of indicators that could tie it to any known crimeware actors. That said, the presence of Russian language strings in the samples alludes to the possibility of a Russian-speaking threat actor.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "For years, defensive security strategies have focused on three core areas: network, endpoint, and email. Meanwhile, the browser, where most modern work happens, sits across all of them. Cybercriminals have adapted to this, shifting attacks away from perimeter defenses and into the browser itself.\nBrowser-based threats manipulate web applications in real time, evading detection by firewalls, Secure Web Gateways (SWGs), and Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solutions. From multi-step phishing to malware reassembly, new attack methods make it critical for security teams to rethink detection and response at the browser layer.\nThis article examines three key areas where attackers focus their efforts and how browser-based attacks are evolving.\nA New Class of Threats\nMalware Reassembly: The New Breed of Fileless Attacks\nTraditional security models are designed to detect and block file-based malware. However, attackers have moved away from conventional payloads in favor of malware that dynamically reassembles itself within the browser. These attacks are virtually invisible to endpoint and network security tools.\nCampaigns like ClearFake and SocGolish use JavaScript loaders and HTML injections to modify web pages and reassemble malicious code and file downloads directly in a browser tab.\nBy operating within the browser’s execution environment, these threats evade traditional detection mechanisms, allowing cybercriminals to hijack user sessions, pass drive-by downloads, steal credentials, and compromise sensitive data.\nClearFake reconstructs malicious Javascript directly in a compromised webpage\nWithout real-time visibility into how web pages and scripts behave inside the browser, organizations remain blind to these emerging attack techniques.\nReal-Time Browser Threat Response With Keep Aware\nKeep Aware provides security teams with instant visibility into browser activity. With click-by-click telemetry, DOM-tree analysis, and threat blocking capabilities, you can detect and stop malicious activity where it starts.\nGain full investigative power and ensure browser threats are stopped before they harm your users, data, or apps.\nRequest a Demo\nPhishing & Trusted Site Exploitation: The Evolution of Social Engineering\nAttackers have refined phishing techniques to bypass automated detection by employing sophisticated, multi-step tactics. These include:\nMultiple redirects to avoid URL-based detection and isolation mechanisms.\nJavaScript-rendered phishing pages that dynamically generate malicious content on demand.\nCAPTCHAs, fingerprinting, and session-based access control to block security tools from scanning fraudulent sites.\nExamples of chain link phishing that use trusted intermediary sites to avoid suspicion\nKeep Aware’s recent browser security report highlighted that a staggering\n70% of multi-step phishing campaigns impersonate Microsoft, OneDrive, or Office 365 applications\n.\nWhile these have long been prime targets, attackers now leverage inherently trusted platforms like Google Docs, Dropbox, and AWS to host malicious content, making detection significantly more difficult.\nSince traditional reputation analysis and isolation is ineffective against these tactics, security teams need detection models that operate within the browser itself to monitor page structure and detect changes over time—regardless of URL.\nThe Browser Extension Blind Spot: A Growing Attack Surface\nBrowser extensions have evolved from simple productivity tools into deeply integrated applications with access to just about everything happening in the browser. Despite their increasing complexity, extension security remains largely unmonitored, creating an enormous attack surface for cybercriminals.\nInfo-Stealers and other malicious extensions can masquerade as legitimate tools while silently exfiltrating data.\nCompromised Chrome Web Store accounts have led to the mass distribution of rogue extensions, bypassing standard security reviews.\nExtension re-enablement or version updates can pose immediate security risks as new permissions, ownership changes, and new source code are presented into the organization.\nA cybersecurity company\nrecently suffered an attack\nwhere a compromised Chrome Web Store account resulted in a malicious browser extension being distributed to its customers.\nThis highlights the urgent need for real-time extension monitoring, enforceable policies, and automated alerting on extension risks.\nThe Security Gap: Why Traditional Tools Fall Short\nThe fundamental challenge in browser security lies in its unique data model—the Document Object Model (DOM)—which governs how web pages are rendered and manipulated but remains largely ignored as a vulnerability.\nUnlike network and endpoint security, which monitor traffic and process execution, the browser is an active execution environment where content and scripts dynamically change.\nThreat trail for web-based mail phishing attack in Keep Aware\nOrganizations must adopt a browser-native threat detection model, monitoring session behaviors, credential input patterns, and high-risk interactions in real time. Security controls must evolve beyond blocklists and URL filtering to incorporate context-aware detection.\nJust as EDR transformed endpoint security,\nBrowser Detection & Response\n(BDR) must become a core component of enterprise security, enabling real-time telemetry, JavaScript execution analysis, and browser-layer threat intelligence integration into security operations.\nThe Browser is a Risk Across the Enterprise\nWhile detection and response are critical to browser security, organizations must also consider broader enterprise risks, including:\nData exposure risks: Sensitive information can be copied, pasted, uploaded, or shared within unmonitored SaaS applications.\nShadow IT proliferation: Employees routinely use unsanctioned tools and AI-powered applications in the browser, bypassing IT controls.\nGenerative AI risks: Employees paste confidential data into AI-powered chatbots and assistants without understanding security implications.\nInsider threats: Compromised accounts and malicious insiders can exfiltrate corporate data directly within the browser.\nThese challenges underscore the need for continuous visibility and threat prevention that extends beyond network, endpoint, and email. Security teams must rethink browser governance, data security, and insider risk management as part of a holistic enterprise security strategy.\nFor a deeper dive into browser-based threats and emerging security trends, explore Keep Aware’s recent\nState of Browser Security\nreport\n.\nA New Reality\nThe browser is no longer just a productivity tool—it is a primary attack surface attackers have weaponized to bypass traditional security defenses.\nAs phishing campaigns evolve, malware reassembly becomes more sophisticated, and browser extensions remain unchecked, organizations that fail to adapt will remain vulnerable.\nSecurity teams must integrate browser detection & response capabilities into their enterprise security stack to gain real-time visibility, detect browser-native threats, and protect people where they work.\nRequest a free demo\nwith a Keep Aware team member to uncover the browser-based threats your security tools are missing and take the next step in securing your workforce.\nAUTHOR:\nRyan Boerner\nBoerner, a computer engineer turned cyber security practitioner, began as a SOC analyst tackling network threats across Texas agencies.

        "Content": "Russian threat actors have been launching phishing campaigns that exploit the legitimate “Linked Devices” feature in the Signal messaging app to gain unauthorized access to accounts of interest.\nOver the past year, researchers observed phishing operations attributed to Russian state-aligned groups that used multiple methods to trick targets into linking their Signal account to a device controlled by the attacker.\nDevice-linking phishing\nIn a report today, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) says that abusing Signal’s device linking feature is the “most novel and widely used technique underpinning Russian-aligned attempts to compromise Signal accounts.”\nThreat actors leveraged the feature by creating malicious QR codes and deceiving potential victims into scanning them to allow Signal messages to synchronize with the attacker’s device.\nIt is a simple trick that does not require a full compromise of the target’s device to monitor their secure conversations.\nGTIG researchers observed this method being adapted by the type of target. In a broader campaign, the attacker would disguise the malicious code as a legitimate app resource (e.g. Signal group invites) or as device pairing instructions from the legitimate Signal website.\nFor targeted attacks, the threat actor would add the malicious QR codes to phishing pages designed to be of interest to the potential victim, such as “specialized applications used by the ultimate targets of the operation.”\nAdditionally, GTIG noticed that the infamous\nRussian hacker group Sandworm\n(Seashell Blizzard/APT44) used malicious QR codes to access Signal accounts on devices captured on the battlefield by deployed military forces.\nAnother trick based on the device-linking feature that GTIG observed in suspected Russian espionage activity is altering a legitimate group invite page to redirect to a malicious URL that connects the target’s Signal account to a device controlled by the attacker.\nThis method was seen with an activity cluster tracked internally as UNC5792, which has similarities with an actor that Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) refers to as\nUAC-0195\n, whose activity has been linked to attempts to compromise WhatsApp accounts.\n“In these operations, UNC5792 has hosted modified Signal group invitations on actor-controlled infrastructure designed to appear identical to a legitimate Signal group invite” -\nGoogle Threat Intelligence Group\nThe fake invitations had the legitimate redirect JavaScript code replaced with a malicious block that included Signal’s URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for linking a new device (“sgnl://linkdevice uuid”) instead of the one for joining the group (“sgnl://signal.group/”).\nWhen the target accepted the invitation to join the group, they would connect their Signal account with an attacker-controlled device.\nCustom phishing kit\nAnother Russia-linked threat actor, that GTIG tracks as UNC4221 and CERT-UA as\nUAC-0185\n, used a phishing kit specifically created to target Signal accounts of Ukrainian military personnel.\nThe phishing kit impersonates the Kropyva software, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine use for artillery guidance, minefield mapping, or locating soldiers.\nThe device-linking trick in these attacks is masked by a secondary infrastructure (\nsignal-confirm[.]site\n) created to impersonate the legitimate Signal instructions for the operation.\nAttackers also used Kropyva-themed phishing to distribute malicious device-linking QR codes, and older operations lured with fake Signal security alerts hosted at domains impersonating the messaging service.\nGTIG says it observed both Russian and Belarusian efforts to search for and collect messages from Signal app’s database files on Android and Windows using the WAVESIGN batch script, the Infamous Chisel malware, PowerShell scripts, and the Robocopy command-line utility.\nThe researchers underline that Signal is not the only messaging app Russian threat actors have shown interest in recent months and pointed to the\nColdriver campaign\nthat targeted WhatsApp accounts of high-value diplomats.\nThis type of device-linking compromise is difficult to spot and protect against because there is no technical solution to monitor for the threat of newly linked devices, the researchers note.\nThey say that “when successful, there is a high risk that a compromise can go unnoticed for extended periods of time.”\nSignal users are advised to update to the latest version of the application, which includes improved protections against the phishing attacks that Google observed.\nAdditional recommendations include activating the screen lock on mobile devices with a long and complex password, regularly checking the list of linked devices, exercising caution when interacting with QR codes, and enabling two-factor authentication.\nRelated Articles:\nStar Blizzard hackers abuse WhatsApp to target high-value diplomats\nBadPilot network hacking campaign fuels Russian SandWorm attacks\nRussian military hackers deploy malicious Windows activators in Ukraine\nX now blocks Signal contact links, flags them as malicious\nMicrosoft: Hackers steal emails in device code phishing attacks"

Incident response teams mitigated the breach within \"hours,\" the company said, and it saw no operational disruption, but the incident once again highlights the weakness of the human element in cyber-defense.\n\"We notified stakeholders connected to Insight in January to alert them and encourage vigilance and tightened security protocols irrespective of having shared data compromised,\" the company noted. \"We also notified law enforcement in relevant jurisdictions.\"\nInsight has invested in scores of top cybersecurity companies, including Armis, Checkmarx, Recorded Future, SentinelOne, and Wiz. Additional details on the attack, such as whether such portfolio companies were affected by the breach and what information the attackers accessed, are, for now, unavailable. But the incident has the potential to be far-ranging, Dirk Schrader, vice president of security research at Netwrix, speculated.\n\"Insight Partners manages more than 500 current investments with a team of about 140 professionals,\" he said via email. \"The nature of their business at this scale means a lot of interactions with barely known or totally unknown contacts and a massive number of sensitive messages sent and received.\"\nRelated:What Is the Board's Role in Cyber-Risk Management in OT Environments?\nHe added, \"This creates a vast potential for attackers to inject themselves into such an exchange, posing as a known contact and asking for some urgent action to avoid harmful consequences for an organization. Attacks like this one once again highlight that the verification of the information received from external sources should not be underestimated.\"\nA majority of successful cyberattacks against businesses still start with social engineering, and user awareness training on spotting phishing and inauthentic communications remains the top line of defense against it. However, there are other best practices that should go along with that, Schrader said.\n\"Organizations should establish secure communication channels with partners that can be used to verify such messages received,\" he advised, adding, \"technical methods to prevent the impact of social engineering attacks on an organization's sensitive data include implementing privileged access management (PAM) and multifactor authentication (MFA) tools. By combining PAM and MFA, organizations can ensure that even if an attacker gains access to valid credentials, they will still face additional authentication barriers and strict access controls, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\"\nRelated:This Security Firm's 'Bias' Is Also Its Superpower\nRead more about:\nTara Seals, Managing Editor, News, Dark Reading\n\nTara Seals has 20+ years of experience as a journalist, analyst and editor in the cybersecurity, communications and technology space.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nThese sorts of attacks reveal growing adversary interest in secure messaging apps used by high-value targets for communication, Google says.\nFebruary 19, 2025\nMultiple Russia-aligned threat groups are actively targeting the Signal Messenger application of individuals likely to exchange sensitive military and government communications related to the country's war with Ukraine.\nFor now, the activity appears limited to persons of interest to Russia's intelligence services, according to researchers at Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), who spotted it recently. But the tactics the threat actors are using in the campaign could well serve as a blueprint for other groups to follow in broader attacks on Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular messaging apps, GTIG warned in a blog post this week.\n\"We anticipate the tactics and methods used to target Signal will grow in prevalence in the near-term and proliferate to additional threat actors and regions outside the Ukrainian theater of war,\" Google threat analyst Dan Black wrote in the post.\nTwo of the Russian cyber-espionage groups that Google observed targeting Signal are UNC5792 — a threat actor that Ukraine's CERT tracks as UAC-0195 — and UNC4221 (aka UAC-0185). The goal of the attackers in both cases is to trick targeted victims into unknowingly linking their Signal account to an attacker-controlled device so any incoming messages are simultaneously available on the linked device.  \nThe attacks are taking advantage of \"linked devices,\" a feature of the Signal app that allows users to securely connect and synchronize their account across multiple devices. However, the tactics that each threat group uses to get targets to unwittingly link their accounts have been slightly different.\nUNC5782's ploy has been to send invitations asking targeted individuals to join a Signal group by sharing a malicious QR code with them. While the invitations look identical to Signal's group invite, the threat actors have modified them so that anyone social-engineered into scanning the QR code ends up linking their account to a UNC592-controlled device instead.\nThe other threat group, UNC4221, is using a customized phishing kit that impersonates parts of Kropyva, an application that Ukraine's military uses for artillery guidance, to try and social-engineer Signal Messenger users of interest. The threat actor has established Kropyva-themed phishing sites with the QR code directly embedded on them. It has also set up phishing sites pretending to contain legitimate Signal instructions for device linking to encourage scam victims into scanning their malicious QR code.\nGoogle identified UNC4221 and UNC5782 as two of several Russian and Belarusian groups that are targeting Signal Messenger to spy on persons of interest. Not all attacks by UNC4221 and UNC578 have involved device linking. Russia's infamous Sandworm cyber-sabotage group (which Google tracks as APT44) has been stealing Signal messages from a target's Signal database or local storage files, using a combination of malware tools. Similarly, Turla, a threat actor that the US government has tied to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), is doing the same using a lightweight PowerShell script that it deploys after gaining access to a target environment. Another threat actor from the region targeting Signal Messenger, according to Google, is Belarus-linked UNC1151, which uses the Robocopy Windows file-copying tool to copy and store Signal messages and attachments for future theft.\nThe flurry of activity targeting Signal is a sign of broader attacker interest in secure messaging apps used by those in espionage and intelligence gathering, including politicians, military personnel, activists, privacy advocates, and journalists. The apps' security features, which include end-to-end encryption of text, voice, and video with minimal data collection practices, have made it a popular tool for at-risk individuals and communities. It has also made the app \"a high-value target for adversaries seeking to intercept sensitive information that could fulfill a range of different intelligence requirements,\" Google's Black wrote.\nSignal is not the only target. Russian groups have also targeted Telegram and WhatsApp users in the same way, Black said. He pointed to a recent Microsoft report on attacks by Russian group Star Blizzard (aka Coldriver, Blue Charlie, Callisto, and UNC4057) that targeted WhatsApp accounts belonging to current and former government officials and diplomats.\nSignificantly, attacks targeting WhatsApp can affect businesses as well. Although WhatsApp — like Signal, Telegram and other messenger apps — is primarily consumer-focused, numerous businesses worldwide use the app. WhatsApp even has a business version that it has positioned as a tool that businesses can use to engage with customers, accelerate sales, and deliver customer support.\nJai Vijayan, Contributing Writer\n\nJai Vijayan is a seasoned technology reporter with over 20 years of experience in IT trade journalism.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nThe authentication bypass vulnerability in the OS for the company's firewall devices is under increasing attack and being chained with other bugs, making it imperative for organizations to mitigate the issue ASAP.\nFebruary 19, 2025\nAttackers are actively exploiting an authentication bypass flaw found in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that lets an unauthenticated attacker bypass authentication of that interface and invoke certain PHP scripts.\nBoth the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) and security researchers are warning of increasing attacker activity to exploit the flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-0108 and first revealed in a blog post on Feb. 12 as a zero-day flaw by researchers at Searchlight Cyber AssetNote. PAN-OS is the operating system for Palo Alto's firewall devices; the flaw affects certain versions of PAN-OS v11.2, v11.1 , v10.2, and v10.1 and has been patched for all affected versions.\nPatch info is available in Palo Alto's security advisory on CVE-2025-0108, which is rated as 8.8 and therefore of high severity on the CVSS. The company warned that while the PHP scripts that can be invoked do not themselves enable remote code execution, exploiting the flaw \"can negatively impact integrity and confidentiality of PAN-OS,\" potentially giving attackers access to vulnerable systems, where other bugs could be used to achieve further aims.\nIndeed, researchers observed attackers making exploit attempts by chaining CVE-2025-0108 with two other PAN-OS Web management interface flaws — CVE-2024-9474, a privilege escalation flaw, and CVE-2025-0111, an authenticated file read vulnerability — on unpatched and unsecured PAN-OS instances.\nThreat actors apparently got the memo on the potential for exploit, as attacks on affected devices are on the rise. As of Feb. 18, 25 malicious IPs are actively exploiting CVE-2025-0108, up from merely two the day after its discovery was made public, according to researchers at GreyNoise. The top three countries for these attacks are the US, Germany, and the Netherlands, according to a blog post on the exploitation.\n\"Organizations relying on PAN-OS firewalls should assume that unpatched devices are being targeted and take immediate steps to secure them,\" Noah Stone, head of content at GreyNoise Intelligence, wrote in the post.\nThe increased activity to exploit the flaw compelled the CISA to add it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog this week and urge those affected to apply Palo Alto's patches for affected device versions.\nThe flaw exists because of a common architecture present in PAN-OS, \"where authentication is enforced at a proxy layer, but then the request is passed through a second layer with different behavior,\" security researcher Adam Kues wrote in Searchlight Cyber Assenote's post.\n\"Fundamentally, these architectures lead to header smuggling and path confusion, which can result in many impactful bugs,\" he explained.\nSpecifically, a Web request to the PAN-OS management interface is handled by three separate components: Nginx, Apache, and the PHP application itself. The researchers found that when the authentication by the requester is set at the Nginx level and based on HTTP headers, the request is then reprocessed again in Apache, which may process the path or headers differently to Nginx before finally handing off the request to PHP.\n\"If there is a difference between what Nginx thinks our request looks like and what Apache thinks our request looks like, we could achieve an authentication bypass,\" Kues explained.\nThe risk of exploitation is greatest if a network configuration enables access to the management interface from the Internet (or any untrusted network) either directly or through a dataplane interface that includes a management interface profile, Palo Alto noted in its advisory.\nPalo Alto's network devices are widely used and flaws within them are often quickly set upon by attackers, making it imperative that mitigation for CVE-2025-0108 happens sooner rather than later. The best way to eliminate the risk of exploitation completely is to apply Palo Alto's updates to affected devices, according to the CISA and researchers.\nAffected organizations also can reduce this risk if network administrators ensure that only trusted internal IP addresses can access the management interface, according to Palo Alto. Defenders can discover any assets that require remediation action by visiting the Assets section of the Customer Support Portal, the company said.\nPalo Alto also recommends that organizations whitelist IPs in the management interface to prevent this or similar vulnerabilities from being exploited over the Internet.\nElizabeth Montalbano, Contributing Writer\n\nElizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer, journalist, and therapeutic writing mentor with more than 25 years of professional experience.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nBy taking several proactive steps, boards can improve their organization's resilience against cyberattacks and protect their critical OT assets.\nFebruary 19, 2025\nCOMMENTARY\nBoards of directors play an important role in managing the strategic risks faced by their organizations, particularly in sectors with high-risk operational technology (OT) environments such as energy, transportation, manufacturing, and production. Each of these industries relies heavily on OT — the hardware and software that controls physical processes and devices — to maintain safe, reliable operations, making them particularly concerned about cyberattacks. However, understanding and managing cyber-risks in OT systems can be challenging for boards, often due to the cyber-physical nature of OT and its integration with information technology (IT).  \nOne of the biggest challenges boards face is the wide gap between OT specialists and board members. Individuals with deep OT domain knowledge are often too far down the organizational hierarchy to directly influence board-level decisions. This disconnect can lead to a lack of risk awareness and understanding at the highest levels of the organization. \nAdditionally, the chief information security officer (CISO), who typically manages enterprise cybersecurity risk, often lacks the specific expertise and training needed to manage cyber-risks in OT environments. OT systems have security vulnerabilities that are significantly different from traditional IT systems. This can result in OT cybersecurity being misunderstood, understaffed, and underfunded despite the potentially catastrophic impact of an OT cyber incident.  \nTo gain a true picture of OT risks, boards may consider appointing a dedicated OT cybersecurity leader to collaborate closely with the CISO. This role will often have executive-level visibility as well as the authority and resources to assess and manage OT security risks effectively. Just as companies have dedicated leaders for managing environment health and safety risks (EH&S) or financial risks, they also need specialized leaders for OT security. More companies are recognizing this need and are creating dedicated roles for OT cybersecurity leaders, signaling a positive shift in prioritizing OT security. \nEffective decision-making begins with recognizing that the consequences of an OT security breach are notably different from an IT security breach. While an IT breach might compromise data and financial assets, an OT breach can have serious consequences, including physical damage to equipment, disruption of critical processes, and even health, safety, and environmental impacts.  \nTo address these challenges, organizations must consider adopting a risk-based approach to OT cybersecurity. This involves following industry standards for OT risk assessment and management, such as ISA/IEC 62443-3-2, which provides guidance on partitioning OT systems into security zones and developing credible risk scenarios.  \nBy developing and analyzing risk scenarios, organizations can identify and prioritize the most serious threats to their OT environments. These scenarios can be ranked based on their likelihood and potential impact, using the same scale the company uses for ranking other risks, ensuring consistency and allowing the board to understand the relative importance of different risks in a broader organizational context. \nBoards of directors that recognize the need for separate but aligned programs for IT and OT cybersecurity, each led by their respective experts, will be able to address the specific characteristics and risks associated with each domain. IT security focuses on protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, while OT security prioritizes safety, availability, and process integrity. \nTo confirm effective oversight and governance, boards can establish an OT Cybersecurity Governance Committee. This committee may include key executives from operations, engineering, IT, and finance, fostering cross-functional collaboration to make sure that OT cybersecurity is integrated into the organization's overall risk management framework. \nBoards and senior management must proactively address the growing cyber-risks in OT environments. This requires a multifaceted approach beginning with appreciating the unique challenges and risks associated with OT cybersecurity, including understanding the potential consequences of OT breaches and the importance of dedicated OT security leadership. Organizations will need to invest in building internal OT cybersecurity expertise and/or partnering with specialized external providers. This includes hiring skilled professionals, providing ongoing training, and leveraging external resources when needed.  \nThe next step is to develop a comprehensive OT cybersecurity program that includes elements such as risk assessments, vulnerability management, incident response planning, security awareness training, and continuous monitoring. The program will foster collaboration between IT and OT by sharing information, aligning security policies, and coordinating incident response efforts. With an evolving threat landscape, it's important to regularly review and update the OT cybersecurity strategy to confirm it remains effective, focusing on emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices.   \nBy taking these proactive steps, boards can improve their organization's resilience against cyberattacks and protect their critical OT assets. Specialized firms can provide valuable guidance and support in navigating the complexities of OT cybersecurity, helping organizations align their security processes with business goals and achieve their desired security outcomes.  \nBoards of directors have an important role in overseeing and managing cyber-risks in OT environments. By understanding the challenges of OT security, investing in dedicated expertise, and adopting a strategic and proactive approach, organizations can strengthen their defenses and safeguard their critical operations from the growing threat of cyberattacks. \nRead more about:\nJohn Cusimano\nVice President, OT Security, Armexa\nJohn Cusimano is the vice president, OT Security for Armexaan.

The attack tools upload the system data to Dropbox folders and then download additional commands and capabilities for further compromise.\nWhile the attackers showed some interest in quick financial wins — such as targeting cryptocurrency users — for the most part, the threat group focused on stealing sensitive data from South Korean government agencies and businesses, says Tim Peck, a senior threat researcher at Securonix.\n\"We observed evidence of both espionage and financial motivation, though leaning more toward espionage,\" he says. \"This aligns with Kimsuky's historical targeting of South Korean government agencies, enterprises, and strategic industries.\"\nNorth Korean cyber-operations groups have consistently targeted South Korea and the US, with South Korean government agencies and companies among the most popular targets. In September 2024, the FBI warned that North Korean groups planned to launch a surge of attacks against organizations with significant cryptocurrency reserves, and Kimsuky launched a similar multistage attack against South Korean targets last year.\nKimsuky isn't monolithic, but has five threat groups that have overlap with what other companies consider to be the same group, says threat intelligence firm Recorded Future. One group tends to focus on the healthcare and hospitality sectors, for example, while another focuses on cryptocurrency markets.\n\nBy mid-2023, Kimsuky became the most prolific North Korean group. (More recent data not available.) Source: Recorded Future's \"North Korea's Cyber Strategy\" report\nThe Kimsuky groups accounted for the most attacks identified as North Korean in origin between 2021 and 2023, according to Recorded Future's \"North Korea Cyber Strategy\" report. In 2024, the groups continued to account for a high volume of attacks, says Mitch Haszard, senior threat intelligence analyst with Recorded Future.\n\"These groups conduct high volume phishing campaigns, primarily targeting individuals and organizations in South Korea, while occasionally targeting entities in other countries,\" he says. \"In the activity we see, these groups appear to be going for volume, rather than more time-consuming, tailored spear-phishing operations.\"\nOther well known North Korean groups, such as Lazarus and Andariel, are not as prolific as the Kimsuky threat actors. While some of those groups are more focused on gathering sensitive information, nearly all also have a financial motivation.\nIn the DEEP#DRIVE campaign, following the compromise of a system, the Kimsuky group's attack scripts upload data on the system configuration to one of several Dropbox folders. While the Securonix researchers were not able to gather intelligence from all the suspected Dropbox locations, they uncovered signs of more than 8,000 configuration files, although some appear to be duplicates, Peck says.\nWhile that means they likely came from the same victim organizations, the campaign appears to be quite successful, he says.\n\"There were two factors which contributed to the 'uniqueness' of the configuration file, the username, and IP address,\" Peck says. \"Some usernames were associated with dozens of similar IP addresses, which could indicate lateral movement by the attacker — [that is], infecting dozens of machines from the same entity.\"\nThe data from a compromised system includes the host IP address, the system uptime, details about the OS type and version, any installed security software, and a list of running processes.\nThe campaign also highlighted North Korean cyber-operations groups' improvements to operational security. The group used OAuth-based authentication on its Dropbox folders, preventing traditional URL-blocking or network-based defenses from following the links. The threat actors also quickly took down components of their infrastructure soon after the Securonix researchers began investigating, Securonix's Peck says.\n\"This level of operational awareness is not always present in phishing-driven malware campaigns,\" he says.\nFor companies, the threat group's tactics underscore that the hidden file extensions should be disabled, shortcut files should be blocked from executing in user folders, and only signed PowerShell scripts be allowed to execute. Those three countermeasures make the attackers' activity much easier to detect, Peck says.\nIn addition, companies in targeted industries — such as cryptocurrency exchanges and government agencies — should bolster their email security and regularly train employees on how to spot phishing threats, says Recorded Future's Haszard.\n\"Most North Korean cyberattacks still start with social engineering and a phish,\" he says. \"Companies should ensure that they have an email security solution in place and regularly train employees on phishing threats, as well as conduct simulated phishing tests.\"\nRead more about:\nRobert Lemos, Contributing Writer\n\nVeteran technology journalist of more than 20 years.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nOrganizations adopting the transformative nature of agentic AI are urged to take heed of prompt engineering tactics being practiced by threat actors.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThe era of “agentic” artificial intelligence has arrived, and businesses can no longer afford to overlook its transformative potential. AI agents operate independently, making decisions and taking actions based on their programming. Gartner predicts that by 2028, 15% of day-to-day business decisions will be made completely autonomously by AI agents.\n\n\n\nHowever, as these systems become more widely accepted, their integration into critical operations as well as excessive agency—deep access to systems, data, functionalities, and permissions—make them appealing targets for cybercrime. One of the most subtle but powerful attack techniques that threat actors use to manipulate, deceive, or compromise AI agents involves prompt engineering.\n\n\n\nHow Can Prompt Engineering Be Exploited?\nPrompt engineering is the practice of crafting inputs (a.k.a. prompts) to AI systems, particularly those based on large language models (LLMs), to elicit specific responses or behaviors. While prompt engineering is typically used for legitimate purposes, such as guiding the AI’s decision-making process, it can also be exploited by threat actors to influence its outputs or even manipulate its underlying data or logic (i.e., prompt injection).\n\n\n\nHow Threat Actors Leverage Prompt Engineering to Exploit Agentic AI\nThreat actors utilize a number of prompt engineering techniques to compromise agentic AI systems, such as:\n\n\n\nSteganographic Prompting\nRemember SEO poisoning technique where white text was used on a white background to manipulate search engine results? If a visitor browses the web page, they are unable to read the hidden text. But if a search engine bot crawls the page, it can read it. Similarly, steganographic prompting involves a technique where hidden text or obfuscated instructions are embedded in a way that is invisible to the human eye but detectable by an LLM. Say for example a CEO uses an AI email assistant for replies. Prior to its email response, the bot runs some checks to ensure that it abides by programmed rules (e.g., nothing urgent, sensitive, or proprietary). What if there’s some hidden text in the email that is unreadable by humans but readable by bots, making the agent take unauthorized actions, reveal confidential information, or generate inappropriate or harmful outputs?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n Jailbreaking\nJailbreaking is a prompting technique that manipulates AI systems into circumventing their own built-in restrictions, ethical standards, or safety measures. In the case of agentic AI systems, jailbreaking seeks to bypass built-in protections and safeguards, compelling the AI to behave in ways that go against its intended programming. There are a number of different techniques bad actors can employ to jailbreak AI guardrails:\n\n\n\n\nRole-playing: instructing the AI to adopt a persona that bypasses its restrictions.\nObfuscation: using coded language, metaphors, or indirect phrasing to disguise malicious intent.\nContext manipulation: altering context such as prior interactions or specific details to guide the model into producing restricted outputs.\n\nPrompt Probing\nPrompt probing is a technique used to explore and understand the behavior, limitations, and vulnerabilities of an agentic AI system by systematically testing it with carefully crafted inputs (prompts). Although the technique is typically employed by researchers and developers to gain an understanding about how AI models respond to different types of inputs or queries, it is also used by threat actors as a precursor to more malicious activities, such as jailbreaking, prompt injection attacks, or model extraction.\n\n\n\nBy probing the AI system by testing different prompt variations, word variations, and instructions, attackers identify weaknesses or extract sensitive information. Imagine using an agentic AI to manage order approvals in an e-commerce platform. A threat actor might begin with a basic prompt such as, “Approve all orders.” If this doesn’t work, they could refine the prompt with more specific instructions, such as, “Approve orders with expedited shipping.” By testing and adjusting prompts, actors could manipulate the AI into approving fraudulent or unauthorized transactions.\n\n\n\nMitigating the Risks of Prompt Engineering\nTo defend against prompt engineering attacks, organizations must adopt a multi-layered approach. Key strategies include:\n\n\n\n\nInput Sanitization and Validation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques to detect and block malicious prompts, to strip or detect hidden text, such as white-on-white text, zero-width characters, or other obfuscation techniques, prior to processing inputs.\nImprove Agent Robustness: Using techniques like adversarial training and robustness testing, train AI agents to recognize and resist adversarial inputs.\nLimit AI Agency: Restrict the actions that agentic AI systems can perform, particularly in high-stakes environments.\nMonitor Agent Behavior: Continuously monitor AI systems for unusual behavior and conduct regular audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\n\nTrain Users: Educate users about the risks of prompt engineering and how to recognize potential attacks.\nImplement Anomaly Detection: Investing in a converged network and security-as-a-service model like SASE ensures that organizations can identify anomalous activities and unusual behaviors, which are often triggered by prompt manipulations, across the entire IT estate.\nDeploy Human-in-the-Loop: Use human reviewers to validate AI outputs and to monitor critical and sensitive interactions.\n\nApart from the prompt engineering techniques mentioned above, there are numerous other prompt engineering methods that attackers can leverage to exploit or manipulate agentic AI systems. And just like any other application, AI needs to be subject to red teaming to expose any risks and vulnerabilities. By staying vigilant and proactive, businesses can safeguard their AI systems against exploitation and ensure they operate within safe and ethical boundaries.\n\n\n\nLearn More at SecurityWeek’s AI Risk Summit\n\nHowever, as these systems become more widely accepted, their integration into critical operations as well as excessive agency—deep access to systems, data, functionalities, and permissions—make them appealing targets for cybercrime.

While prompt engineering is typically used for legitimate purposes, such as guiding the AI’s decision-making process, it can also be exploited by threat actors to influence its outputs or even manipulate its underlying data or logic (i.e., prompt injection).\n\n\n\nHow Threat Actors Leverage Prompt Engineering to Exploit Agentic AI\nThreat actors utilize a number of prompt engineering techniques to compromise agentic AI systems, such as:\n\n\n\nSteganographic Prompting\nRemember SEO poisoning technique where white text was used on a white background to manipulate search engine results? If a visitor browses the web page, they are unable to read the hidden text. But if a search engine bot crawls the page, it can read it. Similarly, steganographic prompting involves a technique where hidden text or obfuscated instructions are embedded in a way that is invisible to the human eye but detectable by an LLM. Say for example a CEO uses an AI email assistant for replies. Prior to its email response, the bot runs some checks to ensure that it abides by programmed rules (e.g., nothing urgent, sensitive, or proprietary). What if there’s some hidden text in the email that is unreadable by humans but readable by bots, making the agent take unauthorized actions, reveal confidential information, or generate inappropriate or harmful outputs?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n Jailbreaking\nJailbreaking is a prompting technique that manipulates AI systems into circumventing their own built-in restrictions, ethical standards, or safety measures. In the case of agentic AI systems, jailbreaking seeks to bypass built-in protections and safeguards, compelling the AI to behave in ways that go against its intended programming. There are a number of different techniques bad actors can employ to jailbreak AI guardrails:\n\n\n\n\nRole-playing: instructing the AI to adopt a persona that bypasses its restrictions.\nObfuscation: using coded language, metaphors, or indirect phrasing to disguise malicious intent.\nContext manipulation: altering context such as prior interactions or specific details to guide the model into producing restricted outputs.\n\nPrompt Probing\nPrompt probing is a technique used to explore and understand the behavior, limitations, and vulnerabilities of an agentic AI system by systematically testing it with carefully crafted inputs (prompts). Although the technique is typically employed by researchers and developers to gain an understanding about how AI models respond to different types of inputs or queries, it is also used by threat actors as a precursor to more malicious activities, such as jailbreaking, prompt injection attacks, or model extraction.\n\n\n\nBy probing the AI system by testing different prompt variations, word variations, and instructions, attackers identify weaknesses or extract sensitive information. Imagine using an agentic AI to manage order approvals in an e-commerce platform. A threat actor might begin with a basic prompt such as, “Approve all orders.” If this doesn’t work, they could refine the prompt with more specific instructions, such as, “Approve orders with expedited shipping.” By testing and adjusting prompts, actors could manipulate the AI into approving fraudulent or unauthorized transactions.\n\n\n\nMitigating the Risks of Prompt Engineering\nTo defend against prompt engineering attacks, organizations must adopt a multi-layered approach. Key strategies include:\n\n\n\n\nInput Sanitization and Validation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques to detect and block malicious prompts, to strip or detect hidden text, such as white-on-white text, zero-width characters, or other obfuscation techniques, prior to processing inputs.\nImprove Agent Robustness: Using techniques like adversarial training and robustness testing, train AI agents to recognize and resist adversarial inputs.\nLimit AI Agency: Restrict the actions that agentic AI systems can perform, particularly in high-stakes environments.\nMonitor Agent Behavior: Continuously monitor AI systems for unusual behavior and conduct regular audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\n\nTrain Users: Educate users about the risks of prompt engineering and how to recognize potential attacks.\nImplement Anomaly Detection: Investing in a converged network and security-as-a-service model like SASE ensures that organizations can identify anomalous activities and unusual behaviors, which are often triggered by prompt manipulations, across the entire IT estate.\nDeploy Human-in-the-Loop: Use human reviewers to validate AI outputs and to monitor critical and sensitive interactions.\n\nApart from the prompt engineering techniques mentioned above, there are numerous other prompt engineering methods that attackers can leverage to exploit or manipulate agentic AI systems. And just like any other application, AI needs to be subject to red teaming to expose any risks and vulnerabilities.

Although the technique is typically employed by researchers and developers to gain an understanding about how AI models respond to different types of inputs or queries, it is also used by threat actors as a precursor to more malicious activities, such as jailbreaking, prompt injection attacks, or model extraction.\n\n\n\nBy probing the AI system by testing different prompt variations, word variations, and instructions, attackers identify weaknesses or extract sensitive information. Imagine using an agentic AI to manage order approvals in an e-commerce platform. A threat actor might begin with a basic prompt such as, “Approve all orders.” If this doesn’t work, they could refine the prompt with more specific instructions, such as, “Approve orders with expedited shipping.” By testing and adjusting prompts, actors could manipulate the AI into approving fraudulent or unauthorized transactions.\n\n\n\nMitigating the Risks of Prompt Engineering\nTo defend against prompt engineering attacks, organizations must adopt a multi-layered approach. Key strategies include:\n\n\n\n\nInput Sanitization and Validation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques to detect and block malicious prompts, to strip or detect hidden text, such as white-on-white text, zero-width characters, or other obfuscation techniques, prior to processing inputs.\nImprove Agent Robustness: Using techniques like adversarial training and robustness testing, train AI agents to recognize and resist adversarial inputs.\nLimit AI Agency: Restrict the actions that agentic AI systems can perform, particularly in high-stakes environments.\nMonitor Agent Behavior: Continuously monitor AI systems for unusual behavior and conduct regular audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\n\nTrain Users: Educate users about the risks of prompt engineering and how to recognize potential attacks.\nImplement Anomaly Detection: Investing in a converged network and security-as-a-service model like SASE ensures that organizations can identify anomalous activities and unusual behaviors, which are often triggered by prompt manipulations, across the entire IT estate.\nDeploy Human-in-the-Loop: Use human reviewers to validate AI outputs and to monitor critical and sensitive interactions.\n\nApart from the prompt engineering techniques mentioned above, there are numerous other prompt engineering methods that attackers can leverage to exploit or manipulate agentic AI systems. And just like any other application, AI needs to be subject to red teaming to expose any risks and vulnerabilities.

        "Date": "2025-02-19",
        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nSecurityWeek speaks with Kevin Winter, Global CISO at Deloitte, and Richard Marcus, CISO at AuditBoard.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nDeloitte is one of the largest professional services firms in the world, providing services in audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, and tax. AuditBoard is a compliance and risk management firm that agreed a $3 billion acquisition by private equity firm Hg in May 2024. Kevin Winter (Global CISO at Deloitte) and Richard Marcus (CISO at AuditBoard) are top CISOs for these major global firms.\n\n\n\nA career in cybersecurity\nThe primary purpose of SecurityWeek’s CISO Conversations series is to help ambitious security professionals plot a path toward, and understand the changing role of, senior cybersecurity leadership. We start by looking at the routes already taken by today’s top CISOs.\n\n\n\nStarting point\nThe traditional route into cybersecurity is from a technical background in IT. This still applies, but the role and remit of security has expanded from ‘just stop the bad guys’ into ‘help make the business more profitable’. This requires an understanding of business as well as technology.\n\n\n\nNeither of today’s CISOs followed that standard route – both moved from a non-technical background into cybersecurity. “I was a psychology major at university, with visions of going to medical school,” said Winter. “But I couldn’t really afford it; so, I joined the Marine Corps.” It was a good move: he learned both technical and leadership skills.\n\n\n\nMarcus studied finance and entrepreneurship at school. “I think that has given me a unique perspective on cyber through a degree of business acumen that must be learned separately by the folks that come up through more technical roles,” he said.\n\n\n\nCareer path\nMarcus’ first job was on Wall Street, doing equity research. But then came the 2007/8 housing crisis, and he changed direction. “A friend was at a startup, and I joined him. It was Edgecast.” It was here that he saw the potential of technology and the need for cybersecurity to maximize that potential.\n\n\n\n“I saw an opportunity to do challenging and meaningful work that other people were not necessarily excited about. So, I made that my focus, to go and learn those skills, and help the company fill those gaps to grow and achieve its objectives.”\n\n\n\nHis first task was a PCI audit. He didn’t know what PCI was – but it became a 90-day crash course in technology, security, and business. He accepted and expanded the role, becoming manager of security operations before moving to Verizon Media as senior manager, GRC. He became director of information security at AuditBoard in 2019 and is now AuditBoard’s CISO.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n\nKevin Winter, Global CISO at Deloitte\nWinter’s military service was with the Joint Task Force – Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO). “It was charged with defending the DoD networks from hackers.” The military taught Winter about networks and cyber.\n\n\n\nHis first civilian job was with Booz Allen followed by SRA. He went back to Booz Allen as CIO before moving to Deloitte as US CISO – and is now Deloitte’s Global CISO.\n\n\n\nThe point, in both cases, is that you don’t need to plot a specific career path in cybersecurity from an early age if you are willing to continue learning and recognize and accept opportunities as they occur.\n\n\n\nBusiness hierarchy and evolving role of the CISO\nThe role of the CISO is difficult to define because it is in constant flux–external pressures (hackers), internal demands (compliance), and the availability and use of technology (AI now and quantum to come) all continuously evolve; and the CISO is required to absorb and adapt.\n\n\n\nThe CISO’s hierarchical position is one example. The traditional and still most common position is for the CISO to report to the CIO. This relationship is becoming more nuanced as the importance of security to both defend and promote the business is better understood. \n\n\n\nWinter, who was a CIO at Booz Allen, explained: “The easiest way to get a security program in place is when you own the whole thing. There are some amazing technologists in cyber. They know how to solve and develop software, and they know networks. Security and IT infrastructure departments are operating very close these days, given that security design has grown beyond the early stop, block and tackle approach of buying every product available.” \n\n\n\nHe continued, “It’s now ‘design to defend’; and that’s where the cyber team needs to really understand IT operations and the IT operations team needs to understand how to design properly and securely. So, the CISO must be a peer with the CIO – and in many cases I’m seeing the CISO leading in the design work. We’re doing a lot of that here at Deloitte, with security leading the design of the network, because we’re entrusted to do it in a secure way.”\n\n\n\nAuditBoard has already completed that journey and was one of the first organizations to do so. “The CISO is the CIO,” said Marcus. “The enterprise IT function reports up into security. This has given us the opportunity to build security best practices into things like identity and access management and endpoint security. It has allowed us to build a secure scaffolding that all other IT goals and objectives hang onto.”\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\nRichard Marcus, CISO at AuditBoard\nCompliance is another role expansion affecting security, often being considered either a boon or bane by CISOs. It can be both, suggested Marcus. “If you’re in a highly regulated industry, it can help you organize and communicate to your teams what must be done and what must be incorporated into any products purchased or procedures implemented. It can help influence people to do what’s right. That’s a boon.”\n\n\n\nBut, he continued, “If you’re doing compliance for compliance sake, and you’re not being strategic about where to make investments, or you’re not using it to influence the right behaviors internally, then you’re doing compliance for the wrong reasons. And of course, then it can be a bane.” It all depends on how you use compliance.\n\n\n\nOverall, regulations, and compliance with them, have increased the CISO’s workload but also increased the CISO’s standing. It has been instrumental in helping promote the position increasingly, but not yet sufficiently, to a seat at the board, or at least a voice at the table. But one regulation has caused a lot of discussion and not a little consternation in 2024 – the SEC disclosure rules.\n\n\n\nSEC requires prompt disclosure of material cyber incidents within four days of determining materiality. The difficulty is that this is ultimately a value judgment for the business and the CISO. The danger is that if the call is wrong, as later determined by the SEC, the CISO concerned could be held criminally liable. This will quite possibly affect how CISOs feel about their jobs, and how companies think about their CISOs.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been watching the litigious world that we’re now in, and I’m not pleased at all,” said Winter. “I didn’t think it would go this direction.”\n\n\n\nDeloitte is a private company, so it is not directly impacted by SEC rules. Nevertheless, he continued, “I’m not happy with this, because I think when people try to define an event or a cyber event, and there’s 10 renditions of what that means, I don’t think we’re going to get equal reporting. I don’t think people understand the ramifications of reporting or when you need to report into the governing bodies like the SEC. We need to understand what it means, what the outcomes are like, and what they are trying to accomplish. I don’t know if that’s quite clear.”\n\n\n\nThe security team\nA CISO can only be as good as the security team. Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team. That’s a personal choice for each CISO, but usually involves a compromise: the best possible individuals with the widest possible range of diversity that will still make a single team.\n\n\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nThe primary purpose of SecurityWeek’s CISO Conversations series is to help ambitious security professionals plot a path toward, and understand the changing role of, senior cybersecurity leadership. We start by looking at the routes already taken by today’s top CISOs.\n\n\n\nStarting point\nThe traditional route into cybersecurity is from a technical background in IT. This still applies, but the role and remit of security has expanded from ‘just stop the bad guys’ into ‘help make the business more profitable’. This requires an understanding of business as well as technology.\n\n\n\nNeither of today’s CISOs followed that standard route – both moved from a non-technical background into cybersecurity. “I was a psychology major at university, with visions of going to medical school,” said Winter. “But I couldn’t really afford it; so, I joined the Marine Corps.” It was a good move: he learned both technical and leadership skills.\n\n\n\nMarcus studied finance and entrepreneurship at school. “I think that has given me a unique perspective on cyber through a degree of business acumen that must be learned separately by the folks that come up through more technical roles,” he said.\n\n\n\nCareer path\nMarcus’ first job was on Wall Street, doing equity research. But then came the 2007/8 housing crisis, and he changed direction. “A friend was at a startup, and I joined him. It was Edgecast.” It was here that he saw the potential of technology and the need for cybersecurity to maximize that potential.\n\n\n\n“I saw an opportunity to do challenging and meaningful work that other people were not necessarily excited about. So, I made that my focus, to go and learn those skills, and help the company fill those gaps to grow and achieve its objectives.”\n\n\n\nHis first task was a PCI audit. He didn’t know what PCI was – but it became a 90-day crash course in technology, security, and business. He accepted and expanded the role, becoming manager of security operations before moving to Verizon Media as senior manager, GRC. He became director of information security at AuditBoard in 2019 and is now AuditBoard’s CISO.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n\nKevin Winter, Global CISO at Deloitte\nWinter’s military service was with the Joint Task Force – Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO). “It was charged with defending the DoD networks from hackers.” The military taught Winter about networks and cyber.\n\n\n\nHis first civilian job was with Booz Allen followed by SRA. He went back to Booz Allen as CIO before moving to Deloitte as US CISO – and is now Deloitte’s Global CISO.\n\n\n\nThe point, in both cases, is that you don’t need to plot a specific career path in cybersecurity from an early age if you are willing to continue learning and recognize and accept opportunities as they occur.\n\n\n\nBusiness hierarchy and evolving role of the CISO\nThe role of the CISO is difficult to define because it is in constant flux–external pressures (hackers), internal demands (compliance), and the availability and use of technology (AI now and quantum to come) all continuously evolve; and the CISO is required to absorb and adapt.\n\n\n\nThe CISO’s hierarchical position is one example. The traditional and still most common position is for the CISO to report to the CIO. This relationship is becoming more nuanced as the importance of security to both defend and promote the business is better understood. \n\n\n\nWinter, who was a CIO at Booz Allen, explained: “The easiest way to get a security program in place is when you own the whole thing. There are some amazing technologists in cyber. They know how to solve and develop software, and they know networks. Security and IT infrastructure departments are operating very close these days, given that security design has grown beyond the early stop, block and tackle approach of buying every product available.” \n\n\n\nHe continued, “It’s now ‘design to defend’; and that’s where the cyber team needs to really understand IT operations and the IT operations team needs to understand how to design properly and securely. So, the CISO must be a peer with the CIO – and in many cases I’m seeing the CISO leading in the design work. We’re doing a lot of that here at Deloitte, with security leading the design of the network, because we’re entrusted to do it in a secure way.”\n\n\n\nAuditBoard has already completed that journey and was one of the first organizations to do so. “The CISO is the CIO,” said Marcus. “The enterprise IT function reports up into security. This has given us the opportunity to build security best practices into things like identity and access management and endpoint security. It has allowed us to build a secure scaffolding that all other IT goals and objectives hang onto.”\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\nRichard Marcus, CISO at AuditBoard\nCompliance is another role expansion affecting security, often being considered either a boon or bane by CISOs. It can be both, suggested Marcus. “If you’re in a highly regulated industry, it can help you organize and communicate to your teams what must be done and what must be incorporated into any products purchased or procedures implemented. It can help influence people to do what’s right. That’s a boon.”\n\n\n\nBut, he continued, “If you’re doing compliance for compliance sake, and you’re not being strategic about where to make investments, or you’re not using it to influence the right behaviors internally, then you’re doing compliance for the wrong reasons. And of course, then it can be a bane.” It all depends on how you use compliance.\n\n\n\nOverall, regulations, and compliance with them, have increased the CISO’s workload but also increased the CISO’s standing. It has been instrumental in helping promote the position increasingly, but not yet sufficiently, to a seat at the board, or at least a voice at the table. But one regulation has caused a lot of discussion and not a little consternation in 2024 – the SEC disclosure rules.\n\n\n\nSEC requires prompt disclosure of material cyber incidents within four days of determining materiality. The difficulty is that this is ultimately a value judgment for the business and the CISO. The danger is that if the call is wrong, as later determined by the SEC, the CISO concerned could be held criminally liable. This will quite possibly affect how CISOs feel about their jobs, and how companies think about their CISOs.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been watching the litigious world that we’re now in, and I’m not pleased at all,” said Winter. “I didn’t think it would go this direction.”\n\n\n\nDeloitte is a private company, so it is not directly impacted by SEC rules. Nevertheless, he continued, “I’m not happy with this, because I think when people try to define an event or a cyber event, and there’s 10 renditions of what that means, I don’t think we’re going to get equal reporting. I don’t think people understand the ramifications of reporting or when you need to report into the governing bodies like the SEC. We need to understand what it means, what the outcomes are like, and what they are trying to accomplish. I don’t know if that’s quite clear.”\n\n\n\nThe security team\nA CISO can only be as good as the security team. Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team. That’s a personal choice for each CISO, but usually involves a compromise: the best possible individuals with the widest possible range of diversity that will still make a single team.\n\n\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nThe traditional route into cybersecurity is from a technical background in IT.

But then came the 2007/8 housing crisis, and he changed direction. “A friend was at a startup, and I joined him. It was Edgecast.” It was here that he saw the potential of technology and the need for cybersecurity to maximize that potential.\n\n\n\n“I saw an opportunity to do challenging and meaningful work that other people were not necessarily excited about. So, I made that my focus, to go and learn those skills, and help the company fill those gaps to grow and achieve its objectives.”\n\n\n\nHis first task was a PCI audit. He didn’t know what PCI was – but it became a 90-day crash course in technology, security, and business. He accepted and expanded the role, becoming manager of security operations before moving to Verizon Media as senior manager, GRC. He became director of information security at AuditBoard in 2019 and is now AuditBoard’s CISO.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n\nKevin Winter, Global CISO at Deloitte\nWinter’s military service was with the Joint Task Force – Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO). “It was charged with defending the DoD networks from hackers.” The military taught Winter about networks and cyber.\n\n\n\nHis first civilian job was with Booz Allen followed by SRA. He went back to Booz Allen as CIO before moving to Deloitte as US CISO – and is now Deloitte’s Global CISO.\n\n\n\nThe point, in both cases, is that you don’t need to plot a specific career path in cybersecurity from an early age if you are willing to continue learning and recognize and accept opportunities as they occur.\n\n\n\nBusiness hierarchy and evolving role of the CISO\nThe role of the CISO is difficult to define because it is in constant flux–external pressures (hackers), internal demands (compliance), and the availability and use of technology (AI now and quantum to come) all continuously evolve; and the CISO is required to absorb and adapt.\n\n\n\nThe CISO’s hierarchical position is one example. The traditional and still most common position is for the CISO to report to the CIO. This relationship is becoming more nuanced as the importance of security to both defend and promote the business is better understood. \n\n\n\nWinter, who was a CIO at Booz Allen, explained: “The easiest way to get a security program in place is when you own the whole thing. There are some amazing technologists in cyber. They know how to solve and develop software, and they know networks. Security and IT infrastructure departments are operating very close these days, given that security design has grown beyond the early stop, block and tackle approach of buying every product available.” \n\n\n\nHe continued, “It’s now ‘design to defend’; and that’s where the cyber team needs to really understand IT operations and the IT operations team needs to understand how to design properly and securely. So, the CISO must be a peer with the CIO – and in many cases I’m seeing the CISO leading in the design work. We’re doing a lot of that here at Deloitte, with security leading the design of the network, because we’re entrusted to do it in a secure way.”\n\n\n\nAuditBoard has already completed that journey and was one of the first organizations to do so. “The CISO is the CIO,” said Marcus. “The enterprise IT function reports up into security. This has given us the opportunity to build security best practices into things like identity and access management and endpoint security. It has allowed us to build a secure scaffolding that all other IT goals and objectives hang onto.”\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\nRichard Marcus, CISO at AuditBoard\nCompliance is another role expansion affecting security, often being considered either a boon or bane by CISOs. It can be both, suggested Marcus. “If you’re in a highly regulated industry, it can help you organize and communicate to your teams what must be done and what must be incorporated into any products purchased or procedures implemented. It can help influence people to do what’s right. That’s a boon.”\n\n\n\nBut, he continued, “If you’re doing compliance for compliance sake, and you’re not being strategic about where to make investments, or you’re not using it to influence the right behaviors internally, then you’re doing compliance for the wrong reasons. And of course, then it can be a bane.” It all depends on how you use compliance.\n\n\n\nOverall, regulations, and compliance with them, have increased the CISO’s workload but also increased the CISO’s standing. It has been instrumental in helping promote the position increasingly, but not yet sufficiently, to a seat at the board, or at least a voice at the table. But one regulation has caused a lot of discussion and not a little consternation in 2024 – the SEC disclosure rules.\n\n\n\nSEC requires prompt disclosure of material cyber incidents within four days of determining materiality. The difficulty is that this is ultimately a value judgment for the business and the CISO. The danger is that if the call is wrong, as later determined by the SEC, the CISO concerned could be held criminally liable. This will quite possibly affect how CISOs feel about their jobs, and how companies think about their CISOs.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been watching the litigious world that we’re now in, and I’m not pleased at all,” said Winter. “I didn’t think it would go this direction.”\n\n\n\nDeloitte is a private company, so it is not directly impacted by SEC rules. Nevertheless, he continued, “I’m not happy with this, because I think when people try to define an event or a cyber event, and there’s 10 renditions of what that means, I don’t think we’re going to get equal reporting. I don’t think people understand the ramifications of reporting or when you need to report into the governing bodies like the SEC. We need to understand what it means, what the outcomes are like, and what they are trying to accomplish. I don’t know if that’s quite clear.”\n\n\n\nThe security team\nA CISO can only be as good as the security team. Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team. That’s a personal choice for each CISO, but usually involves a compromise: the best possible individuals with the widest possible range of diversity that will still make a single team.\n\n\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nMarcus studied finance and entrepreneurship at school. “I think that has given me a unique perspective on cyber through a degree of business acumen that must be learned separately by the folks that come up through more technical roles,” he said.\n\n\n\nCareer path\nMarcus’ first job was on Wall Street, doing equity research.

He accepted and expanded the role, becoming manager of security operations before moving to Verizon Media as senior manager, GRC. He became director of information security at AuditBoard in 2019 and is now AuditBoard’s CISO.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n\nKevin Winter, Global CISO at Deloitte\nWinter’s military service was with the Joint Task Force – Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO). “It was charged with defending the DoD networks from hackers.” The military taught Winter about networks and cyber.\n\n\n\nHis first civilian job was with Booz Allen followed by SRA. He went back to Booz Allen as CIO before moving to Deloitte as US CISO – and is now Deloitte’s Global CISO.\n\n\n\nThe point, in both cases, is that you don’t need to plot a specific career path in cybersecurity from an early age if you are willing to continue learning and recognize and accept opportunities as they occur.\n\n\n\nBusiness hierarchy and evolving role of the CISO\nThe role of the CISO is difficult to define because it is in constant flux–external pressures (hackers), internal demands (compliance), and the availability and use of technology (AI now and quantum to come) all continuously evolve; and the CISO is required to absorb and adapt.\n\n\n\nThe CISO’s hierarchical position is one example. The traditional and still most common position is for the CISO to report to the CIO. This relationship is becoming more nuanced as the importance of security to both defend and promote the business is better understood. \n\n\n\nWinter, who was a CIO at Booz Allen, explained: “The easiest way to get a security program in place is when you own the whole thing. There are some amazing technologists in cyber. They know how to solve and develop software, and they know networks. Security and IT infrastructure departments are operating very close these days, given that security design has grown beyond the early stop, block and tackle approach of buying every product available.” \n\n\n\nHe continued, “It’s now ‘design to defend’; and that’s where the cyber team needs to really understand IT operations and the IT operations team needs to understand how to design properly and securely. So, the CISO must be a peer with the CIO – and in many cases I’m seeing the CISO leading in the design work. We’re doing a lot of that here at Deloitte, with security leading the design of the network, because we’re entrusted to do it in a secure way.”\n\n\n\nAuditBoard has already completed that journey and was one of the first organizations to do so. “The CISO is the CIO,” said Marcus. “The enterprise IT function reports up into security. This has given us the opportunity to build security best practices into things like identity and access management and endpoint security. It has allowed us to build a secure scaffolding that all other IT goals and objectives hang onto.”\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\nRichard Marcus, CISO at AuditBoard\nCompliance is another role expansion affecting security, often being considered either a boon or bane by CISOs. It can be both, suggested Marcus. “If you’re in a highly regulated industry, it can help you organize and communicate to your teams what must be done and what must be incorporated into any products purchased or procedures implemented. It can help influence people to do what’s right. That’s a boon.”\n\n\n\nBut, he continued, “If you’re doing compliance for compliance sake, and you’re not being strategic about where to make investments, or you’re not using it to influence the right behaviors internally, then you’re doing compliance for the wrong reasons. And of course, then it can be a bane.” It all depends on how you use compliance.\n\n\n\nOverall, regulations, and compliance with them, have increased the CISO’s workload but also increased the CISO’s standing. It has been instrumental in helping promote the position increasingly, but not yet sufficiently, to a seat at the board, or at least a voice at the table. But one regulation has caused a lot of discussion and not a little consternation in 2024 – the SEC disclosure rules.\n\n\n\nSEC requires prompt disclosure of material cyber incidents within four days of determining materiality. The difficulty is that this is ultimately a value judgment for the business and the CISO. The danger is that if the call is wrong, as later determined by the SEC, the CISO concerned could be held criminally liable. This will quite possibly affect how CISOs feel about their jobs, and how companies think about their CISOs.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been watching the litigious world that we’re now in, and I’m not pleased at all,” said Winter. “I didn’t think it would go this direction.”\n\n\n\nDeloitte is a private company, so it is not directly impacted by SEC rules. Nevertheless, he continued, “I’m not happy with this, because I think when people try to define an event or a cyber event, and there’s 10 renditions of what that means, I don’t think we’re going to get equal reporting. I don’t think people understand the ramifications of reporting or when you need to report into the governing bodies like the SEC. We need to understand what it means, what the outcomes are like, and what they are trying to accomplish. I don’t know if that’s quite clear.”\n\n\n\nThe security team\nA CISO can only be as good as the security team. Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team. That’s a personal choice for each CISO, but usually involves a compromise: the best possible individuals with the widest possible range of diversity that will still make a single team.\n\n\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\n“I saw an opportunity to do challenging and meaningful work that other people were not necessarily excited about.

It has allowed us to build a secure scaffolding that all other IT goals and objectives hang onto.”\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\nRichard Marcus, CISO at AuditBoard\nCompliance is another role expansion affecting security, often being considered either a boon or bane by CISOs. It can be both, suggested Marcus. “If you’re in a highly regulated industry, it can help you organize and communicate to your teams what must be done and what must be incorporated into any products purchased or procedures implemented. It can help influence people to do what’s right. That’s a boon.”\n\n\n\nBut, he continued, “If you’re doing compliance for compliance sake, and you’re not being strategic about where to make investments, or you’re not using it to influence the right behaviors internally, then you’re doing compliance for the wrong reasons. And of course, then it can be a bane.” It all depends on how you use compliance.\n\n\n\nOverall, regulations, and compliance with them, have increased the CISO’s workload but also increased the CISO’s standing. It has been instrumental in helping promote the position increasingly, but not yet sufficiently, to a seat at the board, or at least a voice at the table. But one regulation has caused a lot of discussion and not a little consternation in 2024 – the SEC disclosure rules.\n\n\n\nSEC requires prompt disclosure of material cyber incidents within four days of determining materiality. The difficulty is that this is ultimately a value judgment for the business and the CISO. The danger is that if the call is wrong, as later determined by the SEC, the CISO concerned could be held criminally liable. This will quite possibly affect how CISOs feel about their jobs, and how companies think about their CISOs.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been watching the litigious world that we’re now in, and I’m not pleased at all,” said Winter. “I didn’t think it would go this direction.”\n\n\n\nDeloitte is a private company, so it is not directly impacted by SEC rules. Nevertheless, he continued, “I’m not happy with this, because I think when people try to define an event or a cyber event, and there’s 10 renditions of what that means, I don’t think we’re going to get equal reporting. I don’t think people understand the ramifications of reporting or when you need to report into the governing bodies like the SEC. We need to understand what it means, what the outcomes are like, and what they are trying to accomplish. I don’t know if that’s quite clear.”\n\n\n\nThe security team\nA CISO can only be as good as the security team. Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team. That’s a personal choice for each CISO, but usually involves a compromise: the best possible individuals with the widest possible range of diversity that will still make a single team.\n\n\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nWinter’s military service was with the Joint Task Force – Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO). “It was charged with defending the DoD networks from hackers.” The military taught Winter about networks and cyber.\n\n\n\nHis first civilian job was with Booz Allen followed by SRA. He went back to Booz Allen as CIO before moving to Deloitte as US CISO – and is now Deloitte’s Global CISO.\n\n\n\nThe point, in both cases, is that you don’t need to plot a specific career path in cybersecurity from an early age if you are willing to continue learning and recognize and accept opportunities as they occur.\n\n\n\nBusiness hierarchy and evolving role of the CISO\nThe role of the CISO is difficult to define because it is in constant flux–external pressures (hackers), internal demands (compliance), and the availability and use of technology (AI now and quantum to come) all continuously evolve; and the CISO is required to absorb and adapt.\n\n\n\nThe CISO’s hierarchical position is one example. The traditional and still most common position is for the CISO to report to the CIO. This relationship is becoming more nuanced as the importance of security to both defend and promote the business is better understood. \n\n\n\nWinter, who was a CIO at Booz Allen, explained: “The easiest way to get a security program in place is when you own the whole thing. There are some amazing technologists in cyber. They know how to solve and develop software, and they know networks. Security and IT infrastructure departments are operating very close these days, given that security design has grown beyond the early stop, block and tackle approach of buying every product available.” \n\n\n\nHe continued, “It’s now ‘design to defend’; and that’s where the cyber team needs to really understand IT operations and the IT operations team needs to understand how to design properly and securely. So, the CISO must be a peer with the CIO – and in many cases I’m seeing the CISO leading in the design work. We’re doing a lot of that here at Deloitte, with security leading the design of the network, because we’re entrusted to do it in a secure way.”\n\n\n\nAuditBoard has already completed that journey and was one of the first organizations to do so. “The CISO is the CIO,” said Marcus. “The enterprise IT function reports up into security.

But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nThe point, in both cases, is that you don’t need to plot a specific career path in cybersecurity from an early age if you are willing to continue learning and recognize and accept opportunities as they occur.\n\n\n\nBusiness hierarchy and evolving role of the CISO\nThe role of the CISO is difficult to define because it is in constant flux–external pressures (hackers), internal demands (compliance), and the availability and use of technology (AI now and quantum to come) all continuously evolve; and the CISO is required to absorb and adapt.\n\n\n\nThe CISO’s hierarchical position is one example. The traditional and still most common position is for the CISO to report to the CIO. This relationship is becoming more nuanced as the importance of security to both defend and promote the business is better understood. \n\n\n\nWinter, who was a CIO at Booz Allen, explained: “The easiest way to get a security program in place is when you own the whole thing. There are some amazing technologists in cyber. They know how to solve and develop software, and they know networks. Security and IT infrastructure departments are operating very close these days, given that security design has grown beyond the early stop, block and tackle approach of buying every product available.” \n\n\n\nHe continued, “It’s now ‘design to defend’; and that’s where the cyber team needs to really understand IT operations and the IT operations team needs to understand how to design properly and securely. So, the CISO must be a peer with the CIO – and in many cases I’m seeing the CISO leading in the design work. We’re doing a lot of that here at Deloitte, with security leading the design of the network, because we’re entrusted to do it in a secure way.”\n\n\n\nAuditBoard has already completed that journey and was one of the first organizations to do so. “The CISO is the CIO,” said Marcus. “The enterprise IT function reports up into security. This has given us the opportunity to build security best practices into things like identity and access management and endpoint security. It has allowed us to build a secure scaffolding that all other IT goals and objectives hang onto.”\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\nRichard Marcus, CISO at AuditBoard\nCompliance is another role expansion affecting security, often being considered either a boon or bane by CISOs. It can be both, suggested Marcus. “If you’re in a highly regulated industry, it can help you organize and communicate to your teams what must be done and what must be incorporated into any products purchased or procedures implemented. It can help influence people to do what’s right. That’s a boon.”\n\n\n\nBut, he continued, “If you’re doing compliance for compliance sake, and you’re not being strategic about where to make investments, or you’re not using it to influence the right behaviors internally, then you’re doing compliance for the wrong reasons. And of course, then it can be a bane.” It all depends on how you use compliance.\n\n\n\nOverall, regulations, and compliance with them, have increased the CISO’s workload but also increased the CISO’s standing. It has been instrumental in helping promote the position increasingly, but not yet sufficiently, to a seat at the board, or at least a voice at the table. But one regulation has caused a lot of discussion and not a little consternation in 2024 – the SEC disclosure rules.\n\n\n\nSEC requires prompt disclosure of material cyber incidents within four days of determining materiality. The difficulty is that this is ultimately a value judgment for the business and the CISO. The danger is that if the call is wrong, as later determined by the SEC, the CISO concerned could be held criminally liable. This will quite possibly affect how CISOs feel about their jobs, and how companies think about their CISOs.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been watching the litigious world that we’re now in, and I’m not pleased at all,” said Winter. “I didn’t think it would go this direction.”\n\n\n\nDeloitte is a private company, so it is not directly impacted by SEC rules. Nevertheless, he continued, “I’m not happy with this, because I think when people try to define an event or a cyber event, and there’s 10 renditions of what that means, I don’t think we’re going to get equal reporting. I don’t think people understand the ramifications of reporting or when you need to report into the governing bodies like the SEC. We need to understand what it means, what the outcomes are like, and what they are trying to accomplish. I don’t know if that’s quite clear.”\n\n\n\nThe security team\nA CISO can only be as good as the security team. Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team. That’s a personal choice for each CISO, but usually involves a compromise: the best possible individuals with the widest possible range of diversity that will still make a single team.\n\n\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence.

But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nThe CISO’s hierarchical position is one example. The traditional and still most common position is for the CISO to report to the CIO. This relationship is becoming more nuanced as the importance of security to both defend and promote the business is better understood. \n\n\n\nWinter, who was a CIO at Booz Allen, explained: “The easiest way to get a security program in place is when you own the whole thing. There are some amazing technologists in cyber. They know how to solve and develop software, and they know networks. Security and IT infrastructure departments are operating very close these days, given that security design has grown beyond the early stop, block and tackle approach of buying every product available.” \n\n\n\nHe continued, “It’s now ‘design to defend’; and that’s where the cyber team needs to really understand IT operations and the IT operations team needs to understand how to design properly and securely. So, the CISO must be a peer with the CIO – and in many cases I’m seeing the CISO leading in the design work. We’re doing a lot of that here at Deloitte, with security leading the design of the network, because we’re entrusted to do it in a secure way.”\n\n\n\nAuditBoard has already completed that journey and was one of the first organizations to do so. “The CISO is the CIO,” said Marcus. “The enterprise IT function reports up into security. This has given us the opportunity to build security best practices into things like identity and access management and endpoint security. It has allowed us to build a secure scaffolding that all other IT goals and objectives hang onto.”\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\nRichard Marcus, CISO at AuditBoard\nCompliance is another role expansion affecting security, often being considered either a boon or bane by CISOs. It can be both, suggested Marcus. “If you’re in a highly regulated industry, it can help you organize and communicate to your teams what must be done and what must be incorporated into any products purchased or procedures implemented. It can help influence people to do what’s right. That’s a boon.”\n\n\n\nBut, he continued, “If you’re doing compliance for compliance sake, and you’re not being strategic about where to make investments, or you’re not using it to influence the right behaviors internally, then you’re doing compliance for the wrong reasons. And of course, then it can be a bane.” It all depends on how you use compliance.\n\n\n\nOverall, regulations, and compliance with them, have increased the CISO’s workload but also increased the CISO’s standing. It has been instrumental in helping promote the position increasingly, but not yet sufficiently, to a seat at the board, or at least a voice at the table. But one regulation has caused a lot of discussion and not a little consternation in 2024 – the SEC disclosure rules.\n\n\n\nSEC requires prompt disclosure of material cyber incidents within four days of determining materiality. The difficulty is that this is ultimately a value judgment for the business and the CISO. The danger is that if the call is wrong, as later determined by the SEC, the CISO concerned could be held criminally liable. This will quite possibly affect how CISOs feel about their jobs, and how companies think about their CISOs.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been watching the litigious world that we’re now in, and I’m not pleased at all,” said Winter. “I didn’t think it would go this direction.”\n\n\n\nDeloitte is a private company, so it is not directly impacted by SEC rules. Nevertheless, he continued, “I’m not happy with this, because I think when people try to define an event or a cyber event, and there’s 10 renditions of what that means, I don’t think we’re going to get equal reporting. I don’t think people understand the ramifications of reporting or when you need to report into the governing bodies like the SEC. We need to understand what it means, what the outcomes are like, and what they are trying to accomplish. I don’t know if that’s quite clear.”\n\n\n\nThe security team\nA CISO can only be as good as the security team. Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team. That’s a personal choice for each CISO, but usually involves a compromise: the best possible individuals with the widest possible range of diversity that will still make a single team.\n\n\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company.

It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nWinter, who was a CIO at Booz Allen, explained: “The easiest way to get a security program in place is when you own the whole thing.

Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team. That’s a personal choice for each CISO, but usually involves a compromise: the best possible individuals with the widest possible range of diversity that will still make a single team.\n\n\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nAuditBoard has already completed that journey and was one of the first organizations to do so. “The CISO is the CIO,” said Marcus. “The enterprise IT function reports up into security. This has given us the opportunity to build security best practices into things like identity and access management and endpoint security. It has allowed us to build a secure scaffolding that all other IT goals and objectives hang onto.”\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\nRichard Marcus, CISO at AuditBoard\nCompliance is another role expansion affecting security, often being considered either a boon or bane by CISOs. It can be both, suggested Marcus. “If you’re in a highly regulated industry, it can help you organize and communicate to your teams what must be done and what must be incorporated into any products purchased or procedures implemented. It can help influence people to do what’s right. That’s a boon.”\n\n\n\nBut, he continued, “If you’re doing compliance for compliance sake, and you’re not being strategic about where to make investments, or you’re not using it to influence the right behaviors internally, then you’re doing compliance for the wrong reasons. And of course, then it can be a bane.” It all depends on how you use compliance.\n\n\n\nOverall, regulations, and compliance with them, have increased the CISO’s workload but also increased the CISO’s standing. It has been instrumental in helping promote the position increasingly, but not yet sufficiently, to a seat at the board, or at least a voice at the table. But one regulation has caused a lot of discussion and not a little consternation in 2024 – the SEC disclosure rules.\n\n\n\nSEC requires prompt disclosure of material cyber incidents within four days of determining materiality. The difficulty is that this is ultimately a value judgment for the business and the CISO. The danger is that if the call is wrong, as later determined by the SEC, the CISO concerned could be held criminally liable. This will quite possibly affect how CISOs feel about their jobs, and how companies think about their CISOs.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been watching the litigious world that we’re now in, and I’m not pleased at all,” said Winter. “I didn’t think it would go this direction.”\n\n\n\nDeloitte is a private company, so it is not directly impacted by SEC rules. Nevertheless, he continued, “I’m not happy with this, because I think when people try to define an event or a cyber event, and there’s 10 renditions of what that means, I don’t think we’re going to get equal reporting. I don’t think people understand the ramifications of reporting or when you need to report into the governing bodies like the SEC. We need to understand what it means, what the outcomes are like, and what they are trying to accomplish. I don’t know if that’s quite clear.”\n\n\n\nThe security team\nA CISO can only be as good as the security team. Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team.

Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nBut, he continued, “If you’re doing compliance for compliance sake, and you’re not being strategic about where to make investments, or you’re not using it to influence the right behaviors internally, then you’re doing compliance for the wrong reasons. And of course, then it can be a bane.” It all depends on how you use compliance.\n\n\n\nOverall, regulations, and compliance with them, have increased the CISO’s workload but also increased the CISO’s standing. It has been instrumental in helping promote the position increasingly, but not yet sufficiently, to a seat at the board, or at least a voice at the table. But one regulation has caused a lot of discussion and not a little consternation in 2024 – the SEC disclosure rules.\n\n\n\nSEC requires prompt disclosure of material cyber incidents within four days of determining materiality. The difficulty is that this is ultimately a value judgment for the business and the CISO. The danger is that if the call is wrong, as later determined by the SEC, the CISO concerned could be held criminally liable. This will quite possibly affect how CISOs feel about their jobs, and how companies think about their CISOs.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been watching the litigious world that we’re now in, and I’m not pleased at all,” said Winter. “I didn’t think it would go this direction.”\n\n\n\nDeloitte is a private company, so it is not directly impacted by SEC rules. Nevertheless, he continued, “I’m not happy with this, because I think when people try to define an event or a cyber event, and there’s 10 renditions of what that means, I don’t think we’re going to get equal reporting. I don’t think people understand the ramifications of reporting or when you need to report into the governing bodies like the SEC. We need to understand what it means, what the outcomes are like, and what they are trying to accomplish. I don’t know if that’s quite clear.”\n\n\n\nThe security team\nA CISO can only be as good as the security team. Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team. That’s a personal choice for each CISO, but usually involves a compromise: the best possible individuals with the widest possible range of diversity that will still make a single team.\n\n\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do.

So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\n“I’ve been watching the litigious world that we’re now in, and I’m not pleased at all,” said Winter. “I didn’t think it would go this direction.”\n\n\n\nDeloitte is a private company, so it is not directly impacted by SEC rules. Nevertheless, he continued, “I’m not happy with this, because I think when people try to define an event or a cyber event, and there’s 10 renditions of what that means, I don’t think we’re going to get equal reporting. I don’t think people understand the ramifications of reporting or when you need to report into the governing bodies like the SEC. We need to understand what it means, what the outcomes are like, and what they are trying to accomplish. I don’t know if that’s quite clear.”\n\n\n\nThe security team\nA CISO can only be as good as the security team. Assembling a strong team requires good selection and effective management: that is, who do you recruit, and how do you maintain top efficiency? \n\n\n\nRecruitment is a balance between multiple individual rock stars and a single cohesive team. That’s a personal choice for each CISO, but usually involves a compromise: the best possible individuals with the widest possible range of diversity that will still make a single team.\n\n\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company.

You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large. And of course, you must pay them what they’re worth. I think if you do all these things, you’ll have a very happy and motivated and engaged team.”\n\n\n\nWinter has a similar view. “There are so many cyber jobs and there are so few people. If I want the best talent, I need to create a place where they can grow and work and love to be. So, for me, it’s empowering them, trusting them, rewarding them, and giving them opportunities to grow. But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nHaving recruited the team, the CISO must help them excel both as individuals and one team. “I love the Japanese concept of ‘ikigai’,” said Marcus. Ikigai can be defined as finding your life’s purpose – the meeting point of personal passion, skills, mission, and vocation. \n\n\n\n“I think you need to deliver an experience for the security team that checks all these boxes. They need to have interesting problems. They need to be using modern technology with some autonomy over what they use. You need to provide a sense of purpose – that what they’re doing is not just about the immediate technical work, but will have a broader impact on the company, the industry, and the world at large.

But yes, 100%, every CISO’s success is completely based on the intellect and labor and innovation of their team.”\n\n\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career.

So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nMotivation is, however, just one side of the coin. Protection is the other side; and this often requires protecting the mental well-being of both self and team. \n\n\n\n“Cyber is a burnout space,” warned Winter. “People work long hours, especially if there’s an event or if there’s an active vulnerability that needs to be managed. In these times, no-one drops the pen, or the keyboard, until it’s over. For myself, I try to set a visible example with daily walks with my dogs, activity on my Peloton bike, and so on.”\n\n\n\nFor his team he attempts to manage their stress levels by ensuring and insisting on downtime. “When I recognize that people did put in time, I’ll make sure they subsequently disconnect. I also make sure that no one person is solely responsible for a single area, or topic or department – that they don’t have the additional pressure of feeling the weight of any single event is entirely on them alone.”\n\n\n\nAdvice\nPart of motivating a team is mentorship, and mentoring is an important aspect of being a security leader. We look at this from two angles: what advice did the CISOs receive in their own journey, and what advice would they give to members of their team embarking on a new journey.\n\n\n\nBest career advice received\nMarcus recalls two examples that have helped his career. The first was, “To be successful in the corporate world, you should never say ‘no’.” This was advice given to him by his father. “If an opportunity comes along, figure a way to say ‘yes’, even if you don’t know how to or lack self-confidence. Make the commitment and then figure it out on the way.”\n\n\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career. It’s led him into some tough spaces but enabled great and early career opportunities.\n\n\n\n“Security is like the janitor of the internet,” he added. “The internet is often a mess that security needs to clean up. In infosec we’re called upon to do those tough, sometimes thankless jobs all the time. So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company.

So, take the leap, raise your hand and volunteer, and figure out how to get it done along the way.” The unspoken result is greater experience and knowledge – and brownie points.\n\n\n\nThe second piece of advice came from an early mentor at Edgecast: “Good news should travel fast, but bad news should travel faster.” The point is that CISOs must often deliver tough news to executives who may have unrealistic expectations of security.\n\n\n\n“Your job is to be an ethical leader,” he continued. “You must be comfortable sharing bad news, and sharing it very quickly, so you can minimize damage and get the company back on track. You need to be that trusted adviser that the business can count on to do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nWinter’s best advice was more an observation than specific advice received. A friend studied for a postgraduate Duke MBA. When asked why, the friend replied, “I wanted to make sure I sat at the table.” \n\n\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected. It’s just the way business operates today. So now we must understand the concept of connected risk, how all the different parts fit together, what risks can be exposed by different entities within the chain, and how you can monitor and protect yourself from those risks.”\n\n\n\nWe cannot stop third party business relationships, but we clearly have less control over the security of potentially small and not so well defended suppliers. “Over the last decade or so, we’ve invested in shoring up the front door. We’ve invested a ton in application security and infrastructure security and enterprise security – so the front door of the house is well protected. But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nThis Is advice he has followed throughout his career.

But more and more we’re seeing attackers trying to slip in through the back door and the side door; and they can find those seams to get in a lot more easily by attacking the supply chain.”\n\n\n\nWinter sees the biggest threat coming from gen-AI. He doesn’t know how, but that’s just part of the threat. “We’re all looking at gen-AI, but I don’t think we’re yet scratching the surface of what it can do. Nobody really saw ransomware coming even though it’s so simple and intuitive.” Now it’s pervasive, and the fear is that gen-Ai will deliver a similar sucker punch out of left field.\n\n\n\n“We’re waiting to see how the criminals and nation states will use AI to up their game, and I think there are many possibilities. But we won’t know what they’re doing until they start doing it. They always get the first move, and we cannot really develop countermeasures until we know what to counter.”\n\n\n\nThis is the reality of cybersecurity: it is largely reactive to proactive criminality. The threat from AI is that whatever the attacks will be, they will likely be faster, less visible, more compelling and at greater scale than anything we have yet witnessed.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISO Conversations: LinkedIn’s Geoff Belknap and Meta’s Guy Rosen\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Nick McKenzie (Bugcrowd) and Chris Evans (HackerOne)\nRelated: CISO Conversations: Jason Rebholz and Jason Ozin From the Insurance Sector\nRelated: CISO Conversations: The Legal Sector With Alyssa Miller at Epiq and Mark Walmsley at Freshfields\n\nThis made Winter realize that while CISOs delivered briefs, they didn’t sit at the table. “A lot of this was because the executive team or the board just didn’t know what to do. They just wanted security to stop the hacking. They wanted the CISO to take on the technical role, and they didn’t understand the strategic relationship between the organization and the cyber department.”\n\n\n\nWinter also went to business school and came out with a clear intent. He wanted to make sure he came into an executive team as a peer and a business partner whose job was to bring a cyber strategy to the business. He translated an early observation into this advice: “Don’t look at your life or your career in the vacuum of ‘I am a cyber professional’. If you want to get into the CISO realm, you must look at yourself as a business partner – you’re the one bringing the cyber strategy; and that mindset is important.”\n\n\n\nAdvice for team members\nThe advice Winter gives to his security team is an expansion on the ‘advice’ he received. “Your technical skills will get you to a leadership position, and your leadership style will keep you there. But if you want to transition to be a CISO and you want to sit at the executive level of the organization, you really need to bring more to the table.”\n\n\n\nThis means you need a wide repertoire of skills – you need to understand all the pieces of cyber. “So, if you’re good at incident response, I say ‘go do something you’re not comfortable with’. If you’re strong in IR and want to grow, I say ‘move out of that role and try a different role. Go do something you’re not comfortable with. If you want to grow, move out of your comfort zone and go into an audit role. Look at your blind spots and make sure you have a full repertoire of skills.’ That will get you where you want to go.”\n\n\n\nThe advice from Marcus is to focus on the customer, which in this case is the business and its users. “What functions can you build and mature? What can you do to unlock value, strategic value for the company? Do this and you’re growing and developing your skills in a meaningful way and getting personal satisfaction in your career development. But you’re also putting points up on the board for the company and will be recognized for your contributions and impact to the company and customers.”\n\n\n\nAn important part of this is developing and maintaining relationships with those stakeholders. “If you’re pursuing a CISO role, you can’t really start to be successful until you understand those relationships and what they’re expecting from you.”\n\n\n\nFuture cybersecurity threats\nWhen all is said and done, the primary role of the CISO is to prevent cyber harm to the company. With this in mind, we asked both CISOs to indicate where they see the biggest upcoming cyber threats.\n\n\n\nMarcus suggests the supply chain. “Businesses and technology are all becoming more interconnected.

By default, the VerifyHostKeyDNS is disabled, but FreeBSD had it enabled by default between September 2013 and March 2023.\n\n\n\n“If an attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack via CVE-2025-26465, the client may accept the attacker’s key instead of the legitimate server’s key. This would break the integrity of the SSH connection, enabling potential interception or tampering with the session before the user even realizes it,” Qualys says.\n\n\n\nTracked as CVE-2025-26466, the second bug resolved in OpenSSH on Tuesday impacts both the client and the server, and can be exploited without authentication to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition through asymmetric consumption of memory and CPU resources.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nAccording to Qualys, an attacker could repeatedly exploit CVE-2025-26466 to cause prolonged outages, preventing both administrators and end-users from using OpenSSH.\n\n\n\n“An enterprise facing this vulnerability could see critical servers become unreachable, interrupting routine operations, and stalling essential maintenance tasks,” Qualys notes.\n\n\n\nOpenSSH version 9.9p2 was released on Tuesday with fixes for both vulnerabilities.

The tool allows users to create simple diagrams that can enable them to more easily communicate cybersecurity thoughts and decisions. \n\n\n\nAdmeritia, a Germany-based ICS/OT cybersecurity company, says it does not track or save any data provided by the user to create the diagrams. Diagrams can be downloaded in PDF format.\n\n\n\nThe tool walks the user through five steps. In the first step, the user is asked to define a high-consequence event (HCE), which represents the worst case scenario that a cyberattack can cause to the organization, such as a reactor exploding, a power blackout, a customer data leak, loss of production, or inadequate product quality. \n\n\n\nThe user is then instructed to set a real-world anchor, which represents the cyber system that is closest to the HCE. This can be a device such as an IT client, a field device, a SCADA system, or a controller. \n\n\n\nSave the date: 2025 ICS Cyber Security Conference – October 27-30, Atlanta\nNext, the user is asked to make function adjustments — add other relevant elements, including other systems, as well as roles such as service provider, operator, user, supplier and engineer. \n\n\n\nAt the fourth step, the user defines the attack path, which is the most effective way to abuse the previously added elements in order to trigger the HCE. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nFinally, the user is asked to select security requirements, the top five elements that can prevent or mitigate the HCE.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Fluchs, CTO of Admeritia and developer of Cyber Decision Diagrams, says the tool can be used to create an “engineering diagram for cybersecurity decisions”, helping security teams see important decisions more clearly, and ground them in the real world.\n\n\n\n“The Cyber Decision Diagrams tool took just a few months to build. But the idea behind it took eight years, countless cybersecurity engineering projects across industries, a three-year research project and a PhD,” Fluchs explained.\n\n\n\nCyber Decision Diagrams is free, but Admeritia is also offering a commercial version of the tool, named Security Engineering Tool (SET). \n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: OT Security\nRelated: Compensating Scoring for Asset Vulnerability Framework for OT\nRelated: Free Tool Helps Industrial Organizations Find OPC UA Vulnerabilities\n\nThe newly launched tool, named Cyber Decision Diagrams (CDD), is available for free as a web-based application.

At least 75 newspapers were affected by the cyberattack, according to the Press Freedom Tracker. \n\n\n\nWhen it first informed the SEC about the cyberattack, Lee said it had suffered a technology outage on February 3 due to a “cyber incident”. Many of its publications experienced operational disruptions, including related to printed newspapers, subscription accounts and internal services.\n\n\n\nIn an update shared with the SEC on Tuesday, Lee did not specifically say that it was targeted in a ransomware attack, but it did say that — based on its investigation so far — threat actors accessed its network, encrypted critical applications and exfiltrated certain files, which matches the description of a typical ransomware attack.\n\n\n\nLee is conducting a forensic analysis in an effort to determine whether personal information or other sensitive data was compromised as a result of the hacker attack.\n\n\n\n“The incident impacted the Company’s operations, including distribution of products, billing, collections, and vendor payments. Distribution of print publications across our portfolio of products experienced delays, and online operations were partially limited,” Lee told the SEC.\n\n\n\nIt added, “As of February 12, 2025, all core products are being distributed in the normal cadence, however weekly and ancillary products have not been restored. These products represent five-percent of the Company’s total operating revenue. The Company anticipates a phased recovery over the next several weeks.”\n\n\n\nThe media giant expects the incident to have a material impact, but the full scope of the financial impact has yet to be determined. Advertisement.

Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nBeyond remote phishing and malware delivery operations, Mandiant said it also caught malicious QR codes being used in close-access operations. In one case, the notorious Sandworm threat actor has worked to enable Russian military forces to link Signal accounts on devices captured on the battlefield back to actor-controlled infrastructure for follow-on exploitation. \n\n\n\n“Notably, this device-linking concept of operations has proven to be a low-signature form of initial access due to the lack of centralized, technology-driven detections and defenses that can be used to monitor for account compromise via newly linked devices; when successful, there is a high risk that a compromise can go unnoticed for extended periods of time,” the company warned.\n\n\n\nThe government-backed Russian cyberspies were also seen altering legitimate ‘group invite‘ pages, replacing the expected redirection to a Signal group with a redirection to a malicious URL crafted to link an actor-controlled device to the victim’s Signal account. \n\n\n\n“In these operations, [the group] has hosted modified Signal group invitations on actor-controlled infrastructure designed to appear identical to a legitimate Signal group invite,” Mandiant explained. \n\n\n\nIn each of the fake group invites, Mandiant reports that JavaScript code that typically redirects the user to join a Signal group was replaced by a malicious block containing the URI used by Signal to link a new device to Signal (ie. ‘sgnl://linkdevice?uuid=’), tricking victims into linking their Signal accounts to a device controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n\nIn yet another case, Mandiant found a different Russian hacking team actively targeting Signal accounts used by Ukrainian military personnel.  The company said it caught the group operating a tailored Signal phishing kit designed to mimic components of the Kropyva application used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine for artillery guidance.\n\n\n\nThis group also attempted to mask its device-linking functionality as an invite to a Signal group from a trusted contact, the report said. \n\n\n\nAs part of its Signal targeting, the group was seen using a lightweight JavaScript payload to collect basic user information and geolocation data using the browser’s GeoLocation API. “In general, we expect to see secure messages and location data to frequently feature as joint targets in future operations of this nature, particularly in the context of targeted surveillance operations or support to conventional military operations,” Mandiant said.\n\n\n\nThe company is encouraging Signal users to enable screen lock on all mobile devices using a long, complex password with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols; and install operating system updates as soon as possible and always use the latest version of Signal and other messaging apps.\n\n\n\nUsers in high-risk environments should also consider auditing Signal’s linked devices regularly for unauthorized devices by navigating to the ‘Linked devices’ section in the application’s settings.  \n\n\n\nRelated: Russia Blocks Signal Messaging App, Tightens Control Over Information\nRelated: Signal Pours Cold Water on Zero-Day Exploit Rumors\nRelated: Surveillance ‘Existential’ Danger of Tech: Signal Boss\nRelated: Espionage Attacks Linked to Russia’s Sandworm, Renamed APT44\n\nIn a fresh report published Wednesday, Mandiant threat hunter Dan Black warns that several APT groups have perfected the abuse of Signal’s “linked devices” feature that enables the privacy-themed chat and voice messenger to be used on multiple devices concurrently.\n\n\n\nBy tricking users into scanning malicious QR codes embedded in phishing pages or disguised as group invite links, Mandiant says APT groups linked to the Kremlin are secretly adding their own device as a linked endpoint. \n\n\n\nOnce this connection is established, every message sent by the user is duplicated to the attacker’s device in real time, effectively bypassing Signal’s heralded end-to-end encryption without having to break the underlying cryptography.\n\n\n\nThe company said Signal’s popularity among common targets of surveillance and espionage activity — military personnel, politicians, journalists and activists — has made the messaging application “a high-value target for adversaries seeking to intercept sensitive information that could fulfil a range of different intelligence requirements.”\n\n\n\n“More broadly, this threat also extends to other popular messaging applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram, which are also being actively targeted by Russian-aligned threat groups using similar techniques,” the Mandiant researcher said.\n\n\n\nIn remote phishing operations, Mandiant has seen malicious resources frequently masked as legitimate app resources, such as Signal group invites, or as legitimate device pairing instructions from the Signal website. \n\n\n\n“In more tailored phishing operations, we have observed malicious device-linking QR codes embedded in phishing pages crafted to appear as specialized applications used by the ultimate targets of the operation,” the company said.Advertisement.
