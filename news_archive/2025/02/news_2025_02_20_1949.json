        "Content": "Freelance software developers are the target of an ongoing campaign that leverages job interview-themed lures to deliver cross-platform malware families known as BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret.\nThe activity, linked to North Korea, has been codenamed DeceptiveDevelopment, which overlaps with clusters tracked under the names\nContagious Interview\n(aka\nCL-STA-0240\n), DEV#POPPER, Famous Chollima, PurpleBravo, and Tenacious Pungsan. The campaign has been ongoing since at least late 2023.\n\"DeceptiveDevelopment targets freelance software developers through spear-phishing on job-hunting and freelancing sites, aiming to steal cryptocurrency wallets and login information from browsers and password managers,\" cybersecurity company ESET\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\nIn November 2024, ESET\nconfirmed\nto The Hacker News the overlaps between DeceptiveDevelopment and Contagious Interview, classifying it as a new\nLazarus Group\nactivity that operates with an aim to conduct cryptocurrency theft.\nThe attack chains are characterized by the use of fake recruiter profiles on social media to reach out to prospective targets and share with them trojanized codebases hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket that deploy backdoors under the pretext of a job interview process.\nSubsequent iterations of the campaign have branched out to other job-hunting platforms like Upwork, Freelancer.com, We Work Remotely, Moonlight, and Crypto Jobs List. As\npreviously highlighted\n, these hiring challenges typically entail fixing bugs or adding new features to the crypto-related project.\nOther than coding tests, the bogus projects masquerade as cryptocurrency initiatives, games with blockchain functionality, and gambling apps with cryptocurrency features. More often than not, the malicious code is embedded within a benign component in the form of a single line.\n\"Additionally, they are instructed to build and execute the project in order to test it, which is where the initial compromise happens,\" security researcher Matěj Havránek said. \"The repositories used are usually private, so the vic-m is first asked to provide their account ID or email address to be granted access to them, most likely to conceal the malicious activity from researchers.\"\nA second method used for achieving initial compromise revolves around tricking their victims into installing a malware-laced video conferencing platform like\nMiroTalk\nor\nFreeConference\n.\nWhile both BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret come with information-stealing capabilities, the former serves as a downloader for the latter. BeaverTail also comes in two flavors: A JavaScript variant that can be placed within the trojanized projects and a native version built using the Qt platform that's disguised as conferencing software.\nInvisibleFerret is a modular Python malware that retrieves and executes three additional components -\npay\n, which collects information and acts as a backdoor that's capable of accepting remote commands from an attacker-controlled server to log keystrokes, capture clipboard content, run shell commands, exfiltrate files and data from mounted drives, as well as install the AnyDesk and browser module, and gather information from browser extensions and password managers\nbow\n, which is responsible for stealing login data, autofill data, and payment information stored in Chromium-based browsers like Chrome, Brave, Opera, Yandex, and Edge\nadc\n, which functions as a persistence mechanism by installing the AnyDesk remote desktop software\nESET said the primary targets of the campaign are software developers working in cryptocurrency and decentralized finance projects across the world, with significant concentrations reported in Finland, India, Italy, Pakistan, Spain, South Africa, Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S.\n\"The attackers don't distinguish based on geographical location and aim to compromise as many victims as possible to increase the likelihood of successfully extracting funds and information.\nThis is also evidenced in the apparent poor coding practices adopted by the operators, ranging from a failure to remove development notes to local IP addresses used for development and testing, indicating that the intrusion set is not concerned about stealth.\nIt's worth noting that the use of job interview decoys is a classic strategy adopted by various North Korean hacking groups, the most prominent of which is a long-running campaign dubbed\nOperation Dream Job\n.\nFurthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the threat actors are also involved in the fraudulent\nIT worker scheme\n, in which North Korean nationals apply for overseas jobs under false identities in order to draw regular salaries as a way to fund the regime's priorities.\n\"The DeceptiveDevelopment cluster is an addition to an already large collection of money-making schemes employed by North Korea-aligned actors and conforms to an ongoing trend of shifting focus from traditional money to cryptocurrencies,\" ESET said.\n\"During our research, we observed it go from primitive tools and techniques to more advanced and capable malware, as well as more polished techniques to lure in victims and deploy the malware.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A previously unknown threat activity cluster targeted European organizations, particularly those in the healthcare sector, to deploy PlugX and its successor, ShadowPad, with the intrusions ultimately leading to deployment of a ransomware called NailaoLocker in some cases.\nThe campaign, codenamed Green Nailao by Orange Cyberdefense CERT, involved the exploitation of a new-patched security flaw in Check Point network gateway security products (\nCVE-2024-24919\n, CVSS score: 7.5). The attacks were observed between June and October 2024.\n\"The campaign relied on DLL search-order hijacking to deploy ShadowPad and PlugX – two implants often associated with China-nexus targeted intrusions,\" the company\nsaid\nin a technical report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe initial access afforded by exploitation of vulnerable Check Point instances is said to have allowed the threat actors to retrieve user credentials and to connect to the VPN using a legitimate account.\nIn the next stage, the attackers carried out network reconnaissance and lateral movement via remote desktop protocol (RDP) to obtain elevated privileges, followed by executing a legitimate binary (\"logger.exe\") to sideload a rogue DLL (\"logexts.dll\") that then serves as a loader for a new version of the\nShadowPad\nmalware.\nPrevious iterations of the attacks detected in August 2024 have been found to leverage similar tradecraft to deliver\nPlugX\n, which also employs DLL side-loading using a McAfee executable (\"mcoemcpy.exe\") to sideload \"McUtil.dll.\"\nLike PlugX, ShadowPad is a privately sold malware that's exclusively used by Chinese espionage actors since at least 2015. The variant identified by Orange Cyberdefense CERT features sophisticated obfuscation and anti-debug measures, alongside establishing communication with a remote server to create persistent remote access to victim systems.\nThere is evidence to suggest that the threat actors attempted to exfiltrate data by accessing the file system and creating ZIP archives. The intrusions culminate with the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to transmit three files, a legitimate executable signed by Beijing Huorong Network Technology Co., Ltd (\"usysdiag.exe\"), a loader named NailaoLoader (\"sensapi.dll\"), and NailaoLocker (\"usysdiag.exe.dat\").\nOnce again, the DLL file is sideloaded via \"usysdiag.exe\" to decrypt and trigger the execution of NailaoLocker, a C++-based ransomware that encrypts files, appends them with a \".locked\" extension, and drops a ransom note that demands victims to make a bitcoin payment or contact them at a Proton Mail address.\n\"NailaoLocker is relatively unsophisticated and poorly designed, seemingly not intended to guarantee full encryption,\" researchers Marine Pichon and Alexis Bonnefoi said.\n\"It does not scan network shares, it does not stop services or processes that could prevent the encryption of certain important files, [and] it does not control if it is being debugged.\"\nOrange has attributed the activity with medium confidence to a Chinese-aligned threat actor owing to the use of the ShadowPad implant, the use of DLL side-loading techniques, and the fact that similar ransomware schemes have been attributed to another Chinese threat group dubbed\nBronze Starlight\n.\nWhat's more, the use of \"usysdiag.exe\" to sideload next-stage payloads has been previously observed in attacks mounted by a China-linked intrusion set tracked by Sophos under the name\nCluster Alpha\n(aka STAC1248).\nWhile the exact goals of the espionage-cum-ransomware campaign are unclear, it's suspected that the threat actors are looking to earn quick profits on the side.\n\"This could help explain the sophistication contrast between ShadowPad and NailaoLocker, with NailaoLocker sometimes even attempting to mimic ShadowPad's loading techniques,\" the researchers said. \"While such campaigns can sometimes be conducted opportunistically, they often allow threat groups to gain access to information systems that can be used later to conduct other offensive operations.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "For decades, Microsoft Exchange has been the backbone of business communications, powering emailing, scheduling and collaboration for organizations worldwide. Whether deployed on-premises or in hybrid environments, companies of all sizes rely on Exchange for seamless internal and external communication, often integrating it deeply with their workflows, compliance policies and security frameworks.\nHowever,\nMicrosoft has officially announced\nthat support for Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019 will end on October 14, 2025. While this may seem like a distant concern, businesses and IT teams must start preparing now. The end of support means that Microsoft will no longer provide security patches, bug fixes or technical support, leaving organizations running on these versions exposed to security vulnerabilities, compliance risks and potential operational disruptions.\nSo, what should businesses do now? In this article, we'll explore the impact of Microsoft's decision, the risks of continuing with an unsupported Exchange environment and the available options to ensure business continuity and security. If you're an IT decision-maker or business leader navigating this transition, keep reading — because ignoring this shift could leave your organization vulnerable.\nWhat does Microsoft's end of support mean for Exchange 2016 and 2019 users?\nThe end of support for Exchange 2016 and 2019 isn't just about losing updates — it's about serious security, compliance and operational risks.\nSecurity risks\n: Without security patches, Exchange 2016 and 2019 become prime targets for cybercriminals. Unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, ransomware attacks and email-based threats, putting sensitive business communications at risk.\nLack of technical support\n: After October 14, 2025, Microsoft won't provide fixes, patches or assistance. If something breaks, IT teams will be on their own — leading to longer downtimes, costly troubleshooting and potential business disruptions.\nCompliance risks\n: Regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) require businesses to use secure, up-to-date software. Running outdated Exchange versions could lead to fines, audits and legal consequences if a security incident occurs.\nOperational inefficiencies\n: Older software lacks modern features, performance enhancements and integrations, making communication slower and IT maintenance more complex. Keeping Exchange 2016 or 2019 running will also cost more over time as support resources dwindle.\nImportant note:\nThis end of support also applies to several related Microsoft products, including Microsoft Office 2016, Microsoft Office 2019, Outlook 2016, Outlook 2019, Skype for Business 2016, Skype for Business 2019, Skype for Business Server 2015 and Skype for Business Server 2019.\nKey dates to keep in mind\nMicrosoft follows a two-phase support lifecycle for its products: Mainstream Support and Extended Support.\nMainstream Support includes feature updates, security patches and technical assistance, while Extended Support focuses solely on critical security fixes — no new features, bug fixes or complimentary support. Once Extended Support ends, Microsoft completely stops all updates and assistance, leaving you without any safety net.\nWhat are the best options to keep your business secure and running smoothly?\nSticking with outdated Exchange versions isn't a viable option for IT teams — the risks far outweigh any short-term convenience. Let's explore the best migration paths and alternatives to keep your organization secure, efficient and compliant.\n1. Upgrade to Exchange Server Subscription Edition (Exchange Server SE)\nMicrosoft has announced Exchange Server Subscription Edition (Exchange Server SE), a new subscription-based version of Exchange for organizations that require an on-premises email solution. This option is best for businesses that need to maintain compliance-driven, on-prem infrastructure or prefer a hybrid model that integrates with Microsoft 365.\nHowever, there are some key things businesses must consider before this migration:\nRequires periodic upgrades\n: Exchange Server SE will require regular updates, meaning IT teams must stay on top of maintenance.\nLicensing and maintenance costs\n: A subscription model means ongoing costs, and organizations will still need to manage and secure their own infrastructure.\nComplex upgrade path from Exchange 2016\n: Microsoft recommends that businesses upgrade to Exchange 2019 before moving to Exchange Server SE since direct in-place upgrades to Exchange SE won't be supported.\n2. Migrate to Exchange Online (Microsoft 365)\nFor businesses looking to move beyond on-premises infrastructure, Exchange Online (Microsoft 365) is a compelling option. This cloud-based solution eliminates server maintenance, enhances security and improves scalability, making it ideal for organizations embracing a cloud-first strategy.\nKey advantages of choosing Exchange Online include:\nNo more server maintenance\n: Microsoft handles all updates, patches and infrastructure management, freeing IT teams from the burden of maintaining Exchange servers.\nBuilt-in security and compliance\n: Exchange Online includes automatic security updates, threat protection and compliance tools to meet regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA.\nScalability and accessibility\n: Employees can securely access email from anywhere, with 99.9% uptime and flexible storage options that scale with business needs.\nEnhanced collaboration\n: As part of Microsoft 365, Exchange Online integrates seamlessly with Teams, SharePoint and OneDrive, improving productivity and data management.\nHowever, there are some potential challenges as well.\nMigration complexity\n: Moving large amounts of email data can be time-consuming and requires careful planning to minimize downtime.\nLicensing costs\n: Microsoft 365 operates on a subscription model, meaning ongoing per-user licensing fees.\nUser adoption and training\n: Employees may need training to fully utilize new features and ensure a smooth transition.\n3. Migrate to Google Workspace\nFor businesses looking for a cost-effective, cloud-first alternative to Microsoft 365, Google Workspace is a strong contender. It provides seamless collaboration, built-in security and reduced IT overhead, making it an appealing choice, especially for organizations that don't require the advanced tools included in many Microsoft 365 plans.\nNotably, Google Workspace is often more cost-competitive than Microsoft 365. While Microsoft 365 pricing ranges from $6 to $22 per user per month, Google Workspace plans typically fall between $6 and $18 per user per month, with enterprise pricing available upon request.\nSome of the advantages in switching to Google Workspace include:\nLower IT overhead\n: No Exchange server maintenance, reducing hardware and operational costs.\nScalability and flexibility\n: Google's cloud infrastructure scales with your business needs without additional IT effort.\nCollaboration and productivity\n: Google Workspace integrates Gmail, Google Drive, Meet and Docs, enabling real-time collaboration across teams.\nMeanwhile, potential challenges include:\nMigration complexity\n: Transitioning from Exchange can be disruptive, requiring careful data migration planning.\nUser training and adoption\n: Employees accustomed to Outlook and Microsoft apps may need training to adapt to Gmail and Google tools.\nIntegration challenges with legacy systems\n: Businesses using on-prem systems, like customer relationship management (CRM) or enterprise resource planning (ERP), that rely on Exchange may struggle with integration. Configuring Google Workspace Sync for Outlook or using third-party migration tools can help bridge the gap.\nPlanning your migration journey from Exchange 2016 and 2019\nWhether you choose to stay on-prem with Exchange Server SE or migrate to the cloud with Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, understanding the right migration steps is essential for a smooth transition.\nPreparing for Exchange Server SE\nFor businesses staying on-premises with Exchange Server SE, the upgrade path depends on your current Exchange version:\nIf you're running Exchange 2016, Microsoft recommends upgrading to Exchange 2019 now, as direct in-place upgrades to Exchange SE won't be supported.\nIf you're already on Exchange 2019, you can simply keep your servers up to date and perform an in-place upgrade to Exchange Server SE once it becomes available.\nTransitioning to a SaaS environment (Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace)\nMigrating to a cloud-based solution like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace offers businesses greater flexibility, security and scalability while eliminating the burden of server maintenance. Below is a high-level checklist to guide your smooth transition from Exchange to a SaaS platform.\nPhase 1: Planning and preparation\nStart by assessing your current environment. Identify mailboxes, shared accounts and integrations with third-party tools like CRM or ERP systems. Choose the right migration method and tools, whether moving from Exchange to Microsoft 365, Exchange to Google Workspace or using Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) migration tools.\nNext, verify your domain in Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, ensuring email routing is properly set up. User communication and training are also crucial — keep employees informed and provide necessary training to minimize disruption. Finally, critical data must be backed up before migration to protect against any unexpected data loss. This is where a reliable backup solution can save the day.\nPhase 2: Migration execution\nTo avoid downtime, configure MX records to keep Exchange running as the primary mail server during the migration. If moving to Google Workspace, set up Google Workspace Migration for Microsoft Exchange (GWMME). Perform an initial batch sync with selected users, then test the migration to ensure emails, contacts and calendars transfer correctly. Migrate users in batches, prioritizing key teams first and monitoring the process closely via admin tools.\nPhase 3: Cutover and post-migration\nOnce the migration is validated, switch MX records to your new platform, redirecting all new emails to Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace.

        "Content": "The Chinese state-sponsored Salt Typhoon hacking group uses a custom utility called JumbledPath to stealthily monitor network traffic and potentially capture sensitive data in cyberattacks on U.S. telecommunication providers.\nSalt Typhoon (aka Earth Estries, GhostEmperor, and UNC2286) is a sophisticated hacking group active since at least 2019, primarily focusing on breaching government entities and telecommunications companies.\nRecently, the U.S. authorities have confirmed that Salt Typhoon was behind several successful breaches of\ntelecommunication service providers\nin the U.S., including Verizon, AT&T, Lumen Technologies, and T-Mobile.\nIt was later revealed that Salt Typhoon managed to\ntap into the private communications\nof some U.S. government officials and stole information related to court-authorized wiretapping requests.\nLast week, the Recorded Future's Insikt Group reported that Salt Typhoon\ntargeted over 1,000 Cisco network devices\n, more than half from the U.S., South America, and India, between December 2024 and January 2025,\nToday, Cisco Talos revealed more details about the threat actor's activity when they breached major telecommunications companies in the U.S., which in some cases spanned over three years.\nSalt Typhoon's tactics\nCisco says Salt Typhoon hackers infiltrated core networking infrastructure primarily through stolen credentials. Apart from a single case involving exploitation of the Cisco\nCVE-2018-0171\nflaw, the cybersecurity company has seen no other flaws, known or zero-days, being exploited in this campaign.\n\"No new Cisco vulnerabilities were discovered during this campaign,\"\nstates Cisco Talos in its report\n. \"While there have been some reports that Salt Typhoon is abusing three other known Cisco vulnerabilities, we have not identified any evidence to confirm these claims.\"\nWhile Salt Typhoon primarily gained access to targeted networks using stolen credentials, the exact method of obtaining the credentials remains unclear.\nOnce inside, they expanded their access by extracting additional credentials from network device configurations and intercepting authentication traffic (SNMP, TACACS, and RADIUS).\nThey also exfiltrated device configurations over TFTP and FTP to facilitate lateral movement, which contained sensitive authentication data, weakly encrypted passwords, and network mapping details.\nThe attackers demonstrated advanced techniques for persistent access and evasion, including frequently pivoting between different networking devices to hide their traces and using compromised edge devices to pivot into partner telecom networks.\nThe threat actors were also observed modifying network configurations, enabling Guest Shell access to execute commands, altering access control lists (ACLs), and creating hidden accounts.\nBypassing access control lists\nSource: Cisco\nThe custom JumbledPath malware\nA primary component of the Salt Typhoon attacks was monitoring network activity and stealing data using packet-capturing tools like Tcpdump, Tpacap, Embedded Packet Capture, and a custom tool called JumbledPath.\nJumpedPath is a Go-based ELF binary built for x86_64 Linux-based systems that allowed it to run on a variety of edge networking devices from different manufacturers, including Cisco Nexus devices.\nJumbledPath allowed Salt Typhoon to initiate packet capture on a targeted Cisco device via a jump-host, an intermediary system that made the capture requests appear as if they originate from a trusted device inside the network while also obfuscating the attacker's true location.\nJumbledPath data handling overview\nSource: Cisco\nThe same tool could also disable logging and clear existing logs to erase traces of its activity and make forensic investigations more difficult.\nCisco lists several recommendations to detect Salt Typhoon activity, such as monitoring for unauthorized SSH activity on non-standard ports, tracking log anomalies, including missing or unusually large '.bash_history' files, and inspecting for unexpected configuration changes.\nOver the past couple of years, Chinese threat actors have increasingly targeted edge networking devices to install custom malware that allows them to monitor network communications, steal credentials, or act as proxy servers for relayed attacks.\nThese attacks have targeted well-known manufacturers, including\nFortinet\n,\nBarracuda\n,\nSonicWall\n, Check Point, D-Link, Cisco, Juniper, NetGear, and Sophos.\nWhile many of these attacks exploited zero-day vulnerabilities, other devices were breached through compromised credentials or older vulnerabilities.

        "Summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide many benefits to security professionals by helping them analyze logs, detect phishing attacks, or offering threat intelligence. Learn from Wazuh how to incorporate an LLM, like ChatGPT, into its open source security platform. [...]",
        "Date": "2025-02-20",
        "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling systems to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. These decisions can include predicting outcomes, automating processes, and detecting anomalies. Large Language Models (LLMs) are specialized AI models designed to process, understand, and generate human-like text.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are trained on diverse and extensive textual data. They are designed to understand language and apply knowledge across numerous domains. LLMs such as GPT-4 and the Claude 3.5 Haiku are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language.\nIn this article, we explore the benefits and capabilities that security professionals can gain by implementing an LLM-powered security assistant. LLMs can enrich security data within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platform. Such integration can support professionals in handling tasks such as log analysis, incident triage, custom rule creation, and improving overall security insights.\nLLMs in Security Operations\nSecurity Operations (SecOps) involves identifying, addressing, and overseeing the reduction of cybersecurity risks within an organization's IT systems. This practice combines people, processes, and technology to defend against cyber threats.\nThese activities are managed within a Security Operations Center (SOC), where a dedicated team analyzes security alerts, investigates possible incidents, and responds to threats in real-time. Security analysts use various tools, including SIEM and XDR, to assist with these tasks.\nLLMs are used for text generation, translation, summarization, and question-answering tasks. Their versatility has made them valuable across various industries, including cybersecurity, enabling faster threat detection, automated analysis, and intelligent decision-making.\nSeveral LLMs are available, each with unique strengths ranging from chatbot interactions to enterprise automation and creative content generation. Some popular examples of LLMs include:\nOpenAI GPT\nClaude (Anthropic)\nGoogle Gemini\nMeta Llama\nMistral AI\nBloom (BigScience)\nDeepSeek\nLeveraging LLMs as assistants for security professionals\nTraditionally, security operations analysts rely on their teams' research, experience, and collective knowledge to detect and respond to cyber threats. However, with the constant changes in the threat landscape, professionals are seeking to balance their expertise with the augmentation offered by AI.\nWe explore some ways LLMs are applied in the daily tasks of a security analyst:\n1.\nLog analysis and data enrichment:\nTrained LLMs like ChatGPT can interpret the output of other security solutions after they detect patterns or signatures of malicious activities. They can also enrich security alerts and analyze text descriptions to help analysts triage and summarize incidents. While LLMs may not yet handle large-scale log analysis or complex event correlation, they are highly effective for smaller tasks that support an analyst’s workflow.\n2.\nThreat intelligence integration:\nLLMs can assist by processing and summarizing external reports or correlating Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) from threat feeds. They can provide summarized contextual insights by translating unstructured data from forums and dark web chatter, making threat intelligence data more digestible to security teams. It can also enhance an analyst's understanding of emerging threats and suggest rule-creation strategies. For example, Claude Haiku is a model specifically fine-tuned for creative and concise language generation. This makes it particularly effective at powering user-facing applications.\n3.\nContextual remediation recommendations:\nGiven its ability to understand security-related queries, LLMs could suggest remediation steps based on the context of security incidents. This will make it easier for security analysts to understand and act on remediation steps without deep expertise.\n4.\nPhishing detection:\nLLMs can read and understand email text like humans, unlike traditional keyword-based filters. They analyze tone, grammar, and context, which are important factors in identifying phishing emails. Integration with email security solutions can help prevent sophisticated Business Email Compromise (BEC) and spear-phishing attacks in real-time.\nIt is important to note that all responses generated by any LLM should be reviewed, as they may sometimes be inaccurate. Despite certain limitations, LLMs provide value to security operations by reducing manual effort and offering valuable assistance to security analysts.\nIntegrating LLMs as cybersecurity assistants using Wazuh\nWazuh\nis an open source security platform that helps organizations detect and respond to security threats by monitoring system activities. Wazuh can integrate with various LLMs to assist security operations in building a cybersecurity assistant for security professionals.\nThe use cases below illustrate how such integrations would be implemented in practice.\nThreat detection and alert enrichment\nLLMs can enrich alerts generated by other threat detection solutions, such as YARA, an open source tool for identifying and classifying malware.\nIn this\nproof of concept\n, the Wazuh Active Response module uses ChatGPT to enrich the YARA scan results, providing additional information about the detected threat. To achieve this,\nWazuh File integrity monitoring\ncontinuously monitors specific directories on an endpoint for any additions or modifications.\nIf a malicious file is downloaded into one of the monitored folders, the FIM module detects the change and triggers the Wazuh\nActive response\nmodule. This module then runs a YARA scan to analyze the file for potential threats.\nOnce YARA identifies a malicious file, ChatGPT enriches the alert with details about the detected threat, helping security teams better understand and respond to the incident. The identified malicious files are then deleted by Wazuh Active Response.\nIn the image below, ChatGPT provides more context to the malicious file detected by YARA.\nThe blog post\nNmap and ChatGPT security auditing with Wazuh\nshows another use case for improving an organization's security posture by enriching security alerts.\nIn this blog post, ChatGPT is used to provide more insight into scan reports from Nmap (Network mapper).\nSecurity operations virtual assistants\nIn this use case, the\nClaude Haiku LLM is integrated with Wazuh\nto provide a chat interface within the Wazuh dashboard. This allows users to query the model on security-related questions, providing contextual insights and accelerating the decision-making process during threat investigation.\nThese integrations leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide intelligence assistance.\nThe image below shows a response generated by the Claude Haiku LLM integrated with the Wazuh dashboard. It shows the response to the query, “What is the MITRE ID for obfuscation?”\nConclusion\nIntegrating LLMs with security operation processes and solutions will increase the value offered by the security team by reducing analyst workload and accelerating decision-making during threat investigation.\nThis will also improve the organization's security posture and operational efficiency by empowering proactive defense mechanisms.\nLearn more about Wazuh.\nSponsored and written by\nWazuh\n."

        "Content": "Microsoft is now testing a fix for a longstanding known issue that is breaking SSH connections on some Windows 11 22H2 and 23H2 systems.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft\nstarted rolling\nWindows 11 Build 26100.3321 (KB5052093) Insiders in the Release Preview Channel on Windows 11 24H2 (Build 26100) with a fix for this bug.\nWhen it\nfirst acknowledged\nthe issue in November, the company explained it affects a \"limited number\" of devices running Windows 11 enterprise, IOT, and education editions. However, Redmond is also investigating whether consumer customers using Windows 11 Home or Pro editions are affected.\n\"Following the installation of the October 2024 security update, some customers report that the OpenSSH (Open Secure Shell) service fails to start, preventing SSH connections,\" the company said in support documents issued for October's\nPatch Tuesday KB5044285 cumulative\nand\nKB5044380 preview\nupdates.\n\"The service fails with no detailed logging, and manual intervention is required to run the sshd.exe process.\"\nUntil a fix is generally available, Redmond says affected users can temporarily fix these SSH connection issues by updating access control list (ACL) permissions on affected directories using the following steps:\nOpen PowerShell as an Administrator.\nUpdate the permissions for the \"C:\\ProgramData\\ssh and C:\\ProgramData\\ssh\\logs\" folder (and repeat these steps for \"C:\\ProgramData\\ssh\\logs\") to allow full control for SYSTEM and the Administrators group while allowing read access for Authenticated Users. If needed, you can restrict read access to specific users or groups by modifying the permissions string.\nUse the following Powershell script to update the permissions:\n$directoryPath = \"C:\\ProgramData\\ssh\" $acl = Get-Acl -Path $directoryPath $sddlString = \"O:BAD:PAI(A;OICI;FA;;;SY)(A;OICI;FA;;;BA)(A;OICI;0x1200a9;;;AU)\" $securityDescriptor = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.RawSecurityDescriptor $sddlString $acl.SetSecurityDescriptorSddlForm($securityDescriptor.GetSddlForm(\"All\")) Set-Acl -Path $directoryPath -AclObject $acl\nRepeat the above steps for C:\\ProgramData\\ssh\\logs.\nOver the last week, Microsoft also\nstarted rolling out a BIOS update\nprovided by ASUS that resolves blue screen of death (BSOD) issues acknowledged in October, and it\nfixed a known issue causing \"boot device inaccessible\" errors\non some Windows Server 2025 systems using iSCSI.\nIn related news, the OpenSSH project has\nreleased security updates\nfor two vulnerabilities: a man-in-the-middle (MitM) flaw (CVE-2025-26465) and a denial-of-service bug (CVE-2025-26466).\nThe former was introduced more than ten years ago, and it's impacting OpenSSH clients when the 'VerifyHostKeyDNS' option is enabled. Successful exploitation allows attackers to hijack SSH sessions to steal credentials, inject commands, and exfiltrate data.\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft rolls out BIOS update that fixes ASUS blue screen issues\nMicrosoft shares workaround for Windows security update issues\nMicrosoft: January Windows security updates break audio playback\nWindows BitLocker bug triggers warnings on devices with TPMs\nMicrosoft fixes bug causing Windows Server 2025 boot errors"

        "Content": "A previously undocumented ransomware payload named NailaoLocker has been spotted in attacks targeting European healthcare organizations between June and October 2024.\nThe attacks exploited\nCVE-2024-24919\n, a Check Point Security Gateway vulnerability, to gain access to targeted networks and deploy the ShadowPad and PlugX malware, two families tightly associated with Chinese state-sponsored threat groups.\nOrange Cyberdefense CERT links the attacks to Chinese cyber-espionage tactics, though there's not enough evidence to attribute them to specific groups.\nNailaoLocker details\nOrange's researchers\nreport\nthat NailaoLocker is a relatively unsophisticated ransomware strain compared to the most prominent families in the space.\nThe reason why Orange sees NailaoLocker as a rather basic ransomware is that, it does not terminate security processes or running services, it lacks anti-debugging and sandbox evasion mechanisms, and does not scan network shares.\n\"Written in C++, NailaoLocker is relatively unsophisticated and poorly designed, seemingly not intended to guarantee full encryption,\" mentions Orange.\nThe malware is deployed on target systems via DLL sideloading (sensapi.dll) involving a legitimate and signed executable (usysdiag.exe).\nThe malware loader (NailaoLoader) verifies the environment by performing memory address checks and then decrypts the main payload (usysdiag.exe.dat) and loads it into memory.\nOverview of the attack chain\nSource: Orange CERT\nNext, the NailaoLocker activates and begins encrypting files using an AES-256-CTR scheme, appending the \".locked\" extension to encrypted files.\nAfter the encryption is done, the ransomware drops an HTML ransom note with the very unusually long filename of \"unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please.html.\"\nNailaoLocker ransom note\nSource: Orange CERT\nThis ransom note instructs the victims to contact them at a disposable ProtonMail address, which, in a few cases seen by BleepingComputer, was johncollinsy@proton[.]me.\nThe ransom note does not indicate that data was stolen, which is odd for most modern ransomware operations.\nEspionage and ransomware combined\nInvestigating deeper, Orange says they found some overlap between the content of the ransom note and a ransomware tool sold by a cybercrime group named Kodex Softwares (formerly\nEvil Extractor\n). However, there were no direct code overlaps, making the connection blurry.\nOrange has shared several hypotheses for the attacks, including false flag operations meant to distract, strategic data theft operations doubled with revenue generation, and, more likely, a Chinese cyberespionage group \"moonlighting\" on the side to earn some money.\nOnly last week,\nSymantec reported\nabout suspected Emperor Dragonfly (a.k.a. Bronze Starlight) operatives deploying RA World ransomware against Asian software firms and demanding a ransom of $2 million.\nCompared to North Korean actors who are known to pursue multiple goals in parallel, including financial gains via ransomware attacks, Chinese state-backed actors haven't followed this approach, so the shift in tactics is concerning.\nRelated Articles:\nChinese espionage tools deployed in RA World ransomware attack\nKuCoin to pay nearly $300 million in penalties after guilty plea\nMirrorFace hackers targeting Japanese govt, politicians since 2019\nWhite House links ninth telecom breach to Chinese hackers\nChinese hackers use custom malware to spy on US telecom networks"

The incident involved a breach of its information systems, including a portion of its email systems. \n\n\n\nBased on NioCorp’s brief description, the attacker leveraged the compromised email system for what appears to be a business email compromise (BEC) scheme that resulted in “misdirected vendor payments” totaling roughly $500,000. \n\n\n\nHackers likely used their access to the company’s emails to send legitimate-looking messages designed to convince the recipient to redirect payments to or from a vendor to a bank account controlled by the cybercriminals.\n\n\n\nThe company has notified financial institutions and law enforcement in an effort to recover the money. Its investigation into the incident is ongoing. \n\n\n\n“Although the Company believes that the cybersecurity incident is limited to the misdirected vendor payments, the Company’s investigation of the cybersecurity incident remains ongoing and the full scope, nature and impact of the cybersecurity incident are not yet known,” NioCorp told the SEC. \n\n\n\nIt added, “As of the date of this filing, the Company has not yet determined whether the cybersecurity incident is reasonably likely to materially impact the Company’s overall financial condition or its results of operations, including whether the Company will ultimately be able to recover all or a portion of the misdirected vendor payments.”\n\n\n\nEvery year the FBI releases a report on cybercrime losses, including losses caused by BEC scams.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nAI systems can sometimes struggle with complex or nuanced situations, so human intervention can help identify and address potential issues that algorithms might not.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThere has been a lot of focus on AI since the start of the year with the creation of a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States. Stargate claims to be the largest AI infrastructure project to date and has the backing of tech companies such as OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle. The vision is to build “the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of AI,” including data centers around the country.\n\n\n\nHowever, this news was quickly eclipsed by the new AI chatbot from China, DeepSeek, which sent the US stock market tumbling as its apparent performance on a small budget has shaken up the tech landscape.\n\n\n\nAI still needs a safety net\nAnd it is only February – I’m sure we will see more AI news hitting headlines as we go through the year. And while it’s crucial to recognize the expanding attack surface that AI may bring, it also has the ability to supercharge human productivity, optimize processes and save costs. However, I caution that any AI technology still needs a safety net – a human-in-the-loop. \n\n\n\nI say this because despite all its advantages (and there are many) there are still technology issues, such as hallucinations, and human issues, such as trusting AI outcomes. Hallucinations are a phenomenon wherein AI perceives patterns or objects that are nonexistent or imperceptible to humans, creating outputs that are nonsensical or altogether inaccurate.\n\n\n\nEven giants such as Amazon and Apple are not immune. Amazon had been planning to roll out a new Alexa powered by generative AI in October 2024, but that didn’t happen. Amazon delayed releasing its new voice assistant until sometime this year because it still needed to overcome AI hallucinations. Amazon felt that hallucinations must be close to zero because, with people tending to use Alexa throughout the day, it could end up providing false information – which at best undermines trust in the technology, and at worst could be dangerous.  A similar issue has affected Apple’s generative AI powered news assistant, which has been withdrawn after disseminating untrue stories that appeared to come from genuine news outlets such as the BBC.\n\n\n\nMirroring our trust in automation\nTrust in newer technologies (or the lack of it) is a recurring narrative that we have seen over the years.  Like AI now, automation was front and center the past 4 years. Remember everyone previously talking about the risks and benefits of the autonomous SOC? Still, it has not happened. We do need automation as a scale function, to enable productivity with fewer people enabled to do ‘more with less’.  But, if you want to truly trust the outcomes generated through automation, you need a human-in-the-loop. What I mean by this is that you need the context of security with human expertise and judgment actively involved in the decision-making during a security process. This mitigates potential risks and ensures that critical security functions are not solely reliant on automated systems. Essentially, humans must be present to review, validate, and intervene when necessary, providing a crucial layer of oversight and accountability. Same holds true for AI today.  Yes, it is a powerful technology, but we still need a human to make sure the output is accurate and will not cause operational problems.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nUpon joining ThreatQuotient in 2016, we promoted the need to “empower the human element of cybersecurity.” Several years later, the RSA Conference theme was “The Human Element.” The whole point being that we can’t (yet) treat any form of automation as a complete replacement but instead we should view it as a tool that can be utilized to deliver more efficiency, effectiveness, productivity and scale and handle more of the workload. However, while I say “not yet”, who knows how this will continue to evolve and what we might be able to do in 5-10 years’ time?\n\n\n\nToday AI systems can sometimes struggle with complex or nuanced situations, so human intervention can help identify and address potential issues that algorithms might not. Without a doubt, the role of the expert human-in-the loop will change over time. Research that we did recently highlighted that individuals trust in some automation use cases, but not others, for example. All respondents believe cybersecurity automation is central to security, and while earlier surveys revealed a great lack of trust in automation outcomes, our most recent edition showed more confidence, with 20% of respondents now reporting a lack of trust as a key challenge to implementation which was a drop from 31% last year. In 2023, there was significant concern around trust, bad decisions, slow user adoption and lack of skill, but we saw these concerns had abated in 2024. \n\n\n\nWhat, when and how\nAs we move forward, the key question will be around what to automate and when, when to use AI, and how to get humans involved. One example is our recently announced partnership with Ask Sage, which will enable government organizations to securely train several supported AI models using curated threat intelligence, generating reports, and quickly and easily building threat insights based on an organization’s specific requirements.\n\n\n\nThis means threat analysts using the platform for threat intelligence and conducting investigations can select data for AI training and run reports on specific threats. Additionally, Ask Sage will continuously train data as new information becomes available, enabling customers to generate reports on any given threat targeting their organization at any time. This means security and analyst teams don’t have to dig through volumes of data and undertake tedious manual tasks. They can cut through the noise and build a threat profile quickly and easily.  All the data can also be consolidated into an easy-to-read summary and analysts also have the ability to verify and validate outputs, to help avoid issues like AI hallucinations, making the analyst’s job so much easier and more productive.\n\n\n\nStriking the right balance\nThis is just one example, I am sure there are many more, and according to Gartner at least 15% of day-to-day decisions will be made autonomously through agent-focused AI, up from zero percent in 2024. The decision of whether an AI system needs a human-in-the-loop is contingent on the specific application, context, and ethical considerations of the task it is undertaking (and we’re seeing this reflected in regulation such as the EU AI Act). While human oversight can enhance accuracy, mitigate biases, and handle unforeseen scenarios, it also presents challenges such as increased cost, dependency on human availability, and the potential for human error. Striking the right balance between machine intelligence and human expertise is essential for creating AI systems that are not only efficient but also ethical and aligned with human values. As AI technology continues to evolve, the role of human-in-the-loop remains a dynamic and evolving aspect of responsible AI usage in operations.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Artificial Intelligence\n\nHowever, this news was quickly eclipsed by the new AI chatbot from China, DeepSeek, which sent the US stock market tumbling as its apparent performance on a small budget has shaken up the tech landscape.\n\n\n\nAI still needs a safety net\nAnd it is only February – I’m sure we will see more AI news hitting headlines as we go through the year.

In 2023, there was significant concern around trust, bad decisions, slow user adoption and lack of skill, but we saw these concerns had abated in 2024. \n\n\n\nWhat, when and how\nAs we move forward, the key question will be around what to automate and when, when to use AI, and how to get humans involved. One example is our recently announced partnership with Ask Sage, which will enable government organizations to securely train several supported AI models using curated threat intelligence, generating reports, and quickly and easily building threat insights based on an organization’s specific requirements.\n\n\n\nThis means threat analysts using the platform for threat intelligence and conducting investigations can select data for AI training and run reports on specific threats. Additionally, Ask Sage will continuously train data as new information becomes available, enabling customers to generate reports on any given threat targeting their organization at any time. This means security and analyst teams don’t have to dig through volumes of data and undertake tedious manual tasks. They can cut through the noise and build a threat profile quickly and easily.  All the data can also be consolidated into an easy-to-read summary and analysts also have the ability to verify and validate outputs, to help avoid issues like AI hallucinations, making the analyst’s job so much easier and more productive.\n\n\n\nStriking the right balance\nThis is just one example, I am sure there are many more, and according to Gartner at least 15% of day-to-day decisions will be made autonomously through agent-focused AI, up from zero percent in 2024. The decision of whether an AI system needs a human-in-the-loop is contingent on the specific application, context, and ethical considerations of the task it is undertaking (and we’re seeing this reflected in regulation such as the EU AI Act). While human oversight can enhance accuracy, mitigate biases, and handle unforeseen scenarios, it also presents challenges such as increased cost, dependency on human availability, and the potential for human error. Striking the right balance between machine intelligence and human expertise is essential for creating AI systems that are not only efficient but also ethical and aligned with human values. As AI technology continues to evolve, the role of human-in-the-loop remains a dynamic and evolving aspect of responsible AI usage in operations.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Artificial Intelligence\n\nAnd it is only February – I’m sure we will see more AI news hitting headlines as we go through the year. And while it’s crucial to recognize the expanding attack surface that AI may bring, it also has the ability to supercharge human productivity, optimize processes and save costs. However, I caution that any AI technology still needs a safety net – a human-in-the-loop. \n\n\n\nI say this because despite all its advantages (and there are many) there are still technology issues, such as hallucinations, and human issues, such as trusting AI outcomes. Hallucinations are a phenomenon wherein AI perceives patterns or objects that are nonexistent or imperceptible to humans, creating outputs that are nonsensical or altogether inaccurate.\n\n\n\nEven giants such as Amazon and Apple are not immune. Amazon had been planning to roll out a new Alexa powered by generative AI in October 2024, but that didn’t happen. Amazon delayed releasing its new voice assistant until sometime this year because it still needed to overcome AI hallucinations. Amazon felt that hallucinations must be close to zero because, with people tending to use Alexa throughout the day, it could end up providing false information – which at best undermines trust in the technology, and at worst could be dangerous.  A similar issue has affected Apple’s generative AI powered news assistant, which has been withdrawn after disseminating untrue stories that appeared to come from genuine news outlets such as the BBC.\n\n\n\nMirroring our trust in automation\nTrust in newer technologies (or the lack of it) is a recurring narrative that we have seen over the years.  Like AI now, automation was front and center the past 4 years. Remember everyone previously talking about the risks and benefits of the autonomous SOC? Still, it has not happened. We do need automation as a scale function, to enable productivity with fewer people enabled to do ‘more with less’.  But, if you want to truly trust the outcomes generated through automation, you need a human-in-the-loop. What I mean by this is that you need the context of security with human expertise and judgment actively involved in the decision-making during a security process. This mitigates potential risks and ensures that critical security functions are not solely reliant on automated systems. Essentially, humans must be present to review, validate, and intervene when necessary, providing a crucial layer of oversight and accountability. Same holds true for AI today.  Yes, it is a powerful technology, but we still need a human to make sure the output is accurate and will not cause operational problems.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nUpon joining ThreatQuotient in 2016, we promoted the need to “empower the human element of cybersecurity.” Several years later, the RSA Conference theme was “The Human Element.” The whole point being that we can’t (yet) treat any form of automation as a complete replacement but instead we should view it as a tool that can be utilized to deliver more efficiency, effectiveness, productivity and scale and handle more of the workload. However, while I say “not yet”, who knows how this will continue to evolve and what we might be able to do in 5-10 years’ time?\n\n\n\nToday AI systems can sometimes struggle with complex or nuanced situations, so human intervention can help identify and address potential issues that algorithms might not. Without a doubt, the role of the expert human-in-the loop will change over time.

They can cut through the noise and build a threat profile quickly and easily.  All the data can also be consolidated into an easy-to-read summary and analysts also have the ability to verify and validate outputs, to help avoid issues like AI hallucinations, making the analyst’s job so much easier and more productive.\n\n\n\nStriking the right balance\nThis is just one example, I am sure there are many more, and according to Gartner at least 15% of day-to-day decisions will be made autonomously through agent-focused AI, up from zero percent in 2024.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nCISA and the FBI warn organizations of attacks employing the Ghost (Cring) ransomware, operated by Chinese hackers.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThe US cybersecurity agency CISA and the FBI have issued a joint alert on a Chinese ransomware operation named Ghost that has hit organizations in over 70 countries.\nAlso known as Cring, the ransomware family has been observed in attacks since 2021, targeting organizations across critical infrastructure, education, government, manufacturing, and technology sectors, as well as religious institutions.\n\n\n\n“Ghost actors, located in China, conduct these widespread attacks for financial gain,” CISA and the FBI note in the joint advisory.\n\n\n\nThe two agencies warn that the ransomware group often rotates its payloads, changes the extensions appended to the encrypted files, and relies on multiple ransom email addresses, which has made attribution difficult.\n\n\n\n“Names associated with this group include Ghost, Cring, Crypt3r, Phantom, Strike, Hello, Wickrme, HsHarada, and Rapture. Samples of ransomware files Ghost used during attacks are: Cring.exe, Ghost.exe, ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe,” the advisory reads.\n\n\n\nThe Ghost ransomware group, CISA and the FBI note, exploits known vulnerabilities in internet-accessible appliances and services for initial access, and deploys a web shell, a Cobalt Strike beacon, and open source tools for privilege escalation and lateral movement before deploying and executing file-encrypting ransomware.\n\n\n\nThe group has been observed exploiting security defects in Fortinet FortiOS (CVE-2018-13379), Adobe ColdFusion (CVE-2010-2861 and CVE-2009-3960), Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) and Exchange (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207 – collectively called ProxyShell).\n\n\n\nUsually moving from initial access to ransomware deployment within days, the Ghost hackers do not focus on achieving persistence, although they have been observed creating new accounts and changing the passwords for existing ones.Advertisement.

An attacker can then add delegation rights to the new account, impersonate a domain administrator for the CIFS service, and then validate the permissions.\n\n\n\n“Compromising the Endpoint Manager server itself would lead to the ability to compromise all of the EPM clients, making this avenue especially impactful,” Horizon3.ai notes.Advertisement.

Ivanti’s January 2025 security update for EPM 2024 and 2022 SU6 addresses all four.\n\n\n\nBecause the initial update caused issues with Windows Action, Ivanti released a second version of the update.

Additional fields reportedly include educational background, employment details, and health information. The threat actor claims that the data is contained in a 16.6 MB Excel (.xlsx) file, comprising 9,698 lines of entries.\nThe alleged dataset also purportedly includes official documents such as verification IDs, service letters (SK), and membership cards (KTA), along with timestamps of their issuance.
