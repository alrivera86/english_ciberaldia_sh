        "Content": "A widespread phishing campaign has been observed leveraging bogus PDF documents hosted on the\nWebflow\ncontent delivery network (CDN) with an aim to steal credit card information and commit financial fraud.\n\"The attacker targets victims searching for documents on search engines, resulting in access to malicious PDF that contains a CAPTCHA image embedded with a phishing link, leading them to provide sensitive information,\" Netskope Threat Labs researcher Jan Michael Alcantara\nsaid\n.\nThe activity, ongoing since the second half of 2024, entails users looking for book titles, documents, and charts on search engines like Google to redirect users to PDF files hosted on Webflow CDN.\nThese PDF files come embedded with an image that mimics a CAPTCHA challenge, causing users who click on it to be taken to a phishing page that, this time, hosts a real Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA.\nIn doing so, the attackers aim to lend the process a veneer of legitimacy, fooling victims into thinking that they had interacted with a security check, while also evading detection by static scanners.\nUsers who complete the genuine CAPTCHA challenge are subsequently redirected to a page that includes a \"download\" button to access the supposed document. However, when the victims attempt to complete the step, they are served a pop-up message asking them to enter their personal and credit card details.\n\"Upon entering credit card details, the attacker will send an error message to indicate that it was not accepted,\" Michael Alcantara said. \"If the victim submits their credit card details two or three more times, they will be redirected to an HTTP 500 error page.\"\nThe development comes as SlashNext detailed a new phishing kit named Astaroth (not to be confused with a\nbanking malware\nof the same name) that's advertised on Telegram and cybercrime marketplaces for $2,000 in exchange for six-months of updates and bypass techniques.\nLike phishing-as-a-service (\nPhaaS\n) offerings, it allows cyber crooks the ability to harvest credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes via bogus login pages that mimic popular online services.\n\"Astaroth utilizes an\nEvilginx\n-style reverse proxy to intercept and manipulate traffic between victims and legitimate authentication services like Gmail, Yahoo, and Microsoft,\" security researcher Daniel Kelley\nsaid\n. \"Acting as a man-in-the-middle, it captures login credentials, tokens, and session cookies in real time, effectively bypassing 2FA.\"\nFound this article interesting?

It's also characterized by the use of Dropbox for payload distribution and data exfiltration.\nIt all starts with a ZIP archive containing a single Windows shortcut (.LNK) file that masquerades as a legitimate document, which, when extracted and launched, triggers the execution of PowerShell code to retrieve and display a lure document hosted on Dropbox, while stealthily establishing persistence on the Windows host via a scheduled task named \"ChromeUpdateTaskMachine.\"\nOne such lure document, written in Korean, pertains to a safety work plan for forklift operations at a logistics facility, delving into the safe handling of heavy cargo and outlining ways to ensure compliance with workplace safety standards.\nThe PowerShell script is also designed to contact the same Dropbox location to fetch another PowerShell script that's responsible for gathering and exfiltrating system information. Furthermore, it drops a third PowerShell script that's ultimately responsible for executing an unknown .NET assembly.\n\"The use of OAuth token-based authentication for Dropbox API interactions allowed seamless exfiltration of reconnaissance data, such as system information and active processes, to predetermined folders,\" the researchers said.\n\"This cloud-based infrastructure demonstrates an effective yet stealthy method of hosting and retrieving payloads, bypassing traditional IP or domain blocklists. Additionally, the infrastructure appeared dynamic and short-lived, as evidenced by the rapid removal of key links after initial stages of the attack, a tactic that not only complicates analysis but also suggests the attackers actively monitor their campaigns for operational security.\"\nSecuronix said it was able to leverage the OAuth tokens to gain additional insights into the threat actor's infrastructure, finding evidence that the campaign may have been underway since September last year.\n\"Despite the missing final stage, the analysis highlights the sophisticated techniques employed, including obfuscation, stealthy execution, and dynamic file processing, which demonstrate the attacker's intent to evade detection and complicate incident response,\" the researchers concluded.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "An RA World ransomware attack in November 2024 targeting an unnamed Asian software and services company involved the use of a malicious tool exclusively used by China-based cyber espionage groups, raising the possibility that the threat actor may be moonlighting as a ransomware player in an individual capacity.\n\"During the attack in late 2024, the attacker deployed a distinct toolset that had previously been used by a China-linked actor in classic espionage attacks,\" the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom,\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\"In all the prior intrusions involving the toolset, the attacker appeared to be engaged in classic espionage, seemingly solely interested in maintaining a persistent presence on the targeted organizations by installing backdoors.\"\nThis included a July 2024 compromise of the Foreign Ministry of a country in southeastern Europe that involved the use of classic DLL side-loading techniques to deploy\nPlugX\n(aka Korplug), a malware\nrepeatedly\nused\nby the Mustang Panda (aka Fireant and RedDelta) actor.\nSpecifically, the attack chains entails the use of a legitimate Toshiba executable named \"toshdpdb.exe\" to sideload a malicious DLL named \"toshdpapi.dll,\" which, in turn, acts as a conduit to load the encrypted PlugX payload.\nOther intrusions linked to the same toolset have been observed in connection with attacks targeting two different government entities in Southeastern Europe and Southeast Asia in August 2024, a telecom operator in September 2024, and another government ministry in a different Southeast Asian country in January 2025.\nHowever, Symantec noted that it observed the PlugX variant being deployed in November 2024 as part of a criminal extortion campaign against a medium-sized software and services company in South Asia.\nIt's not exactly clear how the company's network was compromised, although the attacker claimed to have done so by exploiting a known security flaw in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software (\nCVE-2024-0012\n). The attack culminated with the machines getting encrypted with the RA World ransomware, but not before the Toshiba binary was used to launch the PlugX malware.\nAt this point, it's worth noting that prior analyses from Cisco Talos and Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 have\nuncovered\ntradecraft overlaps\nbetween RA World (formerly called RA Group) and a Chinese threat group known as\nBronze Starlight\n(aka Storm-401 and Emperor Dragonfly) that has a history of using short-lived ransomware families.\nWhile it's not known why an espionage actor is also conducting a financially motivated attack, Symantec theorized that a lone actor is likely behind the effort and that they were attempting to make some quick gains on the side. This assessment also lines up with Sygnia's analysis of Emperor Dragonfly in October 2022, which it\ndescribed\nas a \"single threat actor.\"\nThis form of moonlighting, while rarely observed in the Chinese hacking ecosystem, is a lot more\nprevalent\namong\nthreat actors\nfrom Iran and North Korea.\n\"Another form of financially motivated activity supporting state goals are groups whose main mission may be state-sponsored espionage are, either tacitly or explicitly, allowed to conduct financially motivated operations to supplement their income,\" the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\nsaid\nin a report published this week.\n\"This can allow a government to offset direct costs that would be required to maintain groups with robust capabilities.\"\nSalt Typhoon Exploits Vulnerable Cisco Devices to Breach Telcos\nThe development comes as the Chinese nation-state hacking group referred to as\nSalt Typhoon\nhas been linked to a set of cyber attacks that leverage known security flaws in Cisco network devices (\nCVE-2023-20198\nand\nCVE-2023-20273\n) to penetrate multiple networks.\nThe malicious cyber activity is assessed to have singled out a U.S.-based affiliate of a significant U.K.-based telecommunications provider, a South African telecommunications provider, and an Italian internet service, and a large Thailand telecommunications provider based on communications detected between infected Cisco devices and the threat actor infrastructure.\nThe\nattacks\ntook place between December 4, 2024, and January 23, 2025, Recorded Future's Insikt Group said, adding the adversary, also tracked as Earth Estries, FamousSparrow, GhostEmperor, RedMike, and UNC2286, attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally during the timeframe.\nMore than half of the targeted Cisco appliances are located in the U.S., South America, and India. In what appears to be a broadening of the targeting focus, Salt Typhoon has also been observed devices associated with more than a dozen universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the U.S., and Vietnam.\n\"RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft,\" the company\nsaid\n.\nA successful compromise is followed by the threat actor using the elevated privileges to change the device's configuration and add a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure.\nUsing vulnerable network appliances as entry points to target victims has become something of a standard playbook for Salt Typhoon and other\nChinese\nhacking groups\nsuch as\nVolt Typhoon\n, in part owing to the fact that they lack security controls and are not supported by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.\nTo mitigate the risk posed by such attacks, it's recommended that organizations prioritize applying available security patches and updates to publicly-accessible network devices and avoid exposing administrative interfaces or non-essential services to the internet, particularly for those that have reached end-of-life (EoL).\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "AI is everywhere now, transforming how businesses operate and how users engage with apps, devices, and services. A lot of applications now have some Artificial Intelligence inside, whether supporting a chat interface, intelligently analyzing data or matching user preferences. No question AI benefits users, but it also brings new security challenges, especially Identity-related security challenges. Let's explore what these challenges are and what you can do to face them with Okta.\nWhich AI?\nEveryone talks about AI, but this term is very general, and several technologies fall under this umbrella. For example, symbolic AI uses technologies such as logic programming, expert systems, and semantic networks. Other approaches use neural networks, Bayesian networks, and other tools. Newer Generative AI uses Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLM) as core technologies to generate content such as text, images, video, audio, etc. Many of the applications we use most often today, like chatbots, search, or content creation, are powered by ML and LLM. That's why when people talk about AI, they're probably referring to ML and LLM based AI.\nAI systems and AI-powered applications have different levels of complexity and are exposed to different risks. Typically, a vulnerability in an AI system also affects the AI-powered applications that depend on it. In this article, we will focus on the risks that affect AI-powered applications—those that most organizations have already started building or will be building in the near future.\nDefend Your GenAI Apps from identity threats\nThere are four critical requirements for which identity is crucial when building AI applications.\nFirst,\nuser authentication\n. The agent or app needs to know who the user is. For example, a chatbot might need to display my chat history or know my age and country of residence to customize replies. This requires some form of identification, which can be done with authentication.\nSecond,\ncalling APIs on behalf of users\n. AI agents connect to far more apps than a typical web application. As GenAI apps integrate with more products, calling APIs securely will be critical.\nThird,\nasynchronous workflows\n. AI agents may need to take more time to complete tasks or wait for complex conditions to be met. It might be minutes or hours, but it could also be days. Users won't wait that long. These cases will become mainstream and will be implemented as asynchronous workflows, with agents running in the background. For these scenarios, humans will act as supervisors, approving or rejecting actions when away from a chatbot.\nFourth, Authorization for\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nAlmost all GenAI apps can feed information from multiple systems to AI models in order to implement RAG. To avoid sensitive information disclosure, all data fed to AI models to respond or act on behalf of a user must be data the user has permission to access.\nWe need to solve all four requirements to realize GenAI's full potential and help make sure that our GenAI applications are built securely.\nLeveraging AI to help with security attacks\nAI has also made it easier and faster for attackers to carry out targeted attacks. For example, by leveraging AI to run social engineering attacks or creating deepfakes. In addition, attackers can use AI to exploit vulnerabilities in applications at scale. Building GenAI into applications securely is one challenge, but what about using AI to help detect and respond to potential attacks faster with security threats?\nTraditional security measures like MFA are no longer enough by themselves. Integrating AI into your identity security strategy can help detect bots, stolen sessions, or suspicious activity. It helps us:\nDo intelligent signal analysis to detect unauthorized or suspicious access attempts\nAnalyze various signals related to application access activity and compare them to historical data in search of common patterns\nTerminate a session automatically if suspicious activity is detected\nThe rise of AI-based applications has a vast amount of potential, however, AI also poses new security challenges.\nWhat's next?\nAI is changing the way humans interact with technology and with each other. In the next decade, we will see the rise of a huge AI agent ecosystem—networks of interconnected AI programs that integrate into our applications and act autonomously for us. While GenAI has many positives, it also introduces significant security risks that must be considered when building AI applications. Enabling builders to securely integrate GenAI into their apps to make them AI and enterprise-ready is crucial.\nThe flip side of AI is how it can help with traditional security threats. AI applications face similar security issues as traditional applications, such as unauthorized access to information, but with the use of new attack techniques by malicious actors.\nAI is a reality, for better or for worse. It brings countless benefits to users and builders, but at the same time, concerns and new challenges on the security side and all up throughout every organization.\nIdentity companies like\nAuth0\nare here to help take the security piece off your plate.

Some of the other targets include a telecommunications entity and a university, both located in Southeast Asia.\n\"While the REF7707 campaign is characterized by a well-engineered, highly capable, novel intrusion set, the campaign owners exhibited poor campaign management and inconsistent evasion practices,\" security researchers Andrew Pease and Seth Goodwin\nsaid\nin a technical analysis.\nThe exact initial access vector used in the attacks is currently not clear, although it has been observed that Microsoft's\ncertutil application\nis used to download additional payloads from a web server associated with the Foreign Ministry.\nThe certutil commands used to retrieve the suspicious files have been found to be executed via the Windows Remote Management's Remote Shell plugin (\nWinrsHost.exe\n) from an unknown source system on a connected network.\n\"It indicates that attackers already possessed valid network credentials and were using them for lateral movement from a previously compromised host in the environment,\" the researchers noted.\nThe first of the files to be executed is a malware named PATHLOADER that allows for the execution of encrypted shellcode received from an external server.

        "Content": "Security researchers discovered a name confusion attack that allows access to an Amazon Web Services account to anyone that publishes an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with a specific name.\nDubbed \"whoAMI,\" the attack was\ncrafted by DataDog researchers\nin August 2024, who demonstrated that it's possible for attackers to gain code execution within AWS accounts by exploiting how software projects retrieve AMI IDs.\nAmazon confirmed the vulnerability and pushed a fix in September but the problem persists on the customer side in environments where organizations fail to update the code.\nCarrying out the whoAMI attack\nAMIs are virtual machines preconfigured with the necessary software (operating system, applications) used for creating virtual servers, which are called EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances in the AWS ecosystem.\nThere are public and private AMIs, each with a specific identifier. In the case of public ones, users can search in the AWS catalog for the right ID of the AMI they need.\nTo make sure that the AMI is from a trusted source in the AWS marketplace, the search needs to include the 'owners' attribute, otherwise the risk of a whoAMI name confusion attack increases.\nThe whoAMI attack is possible due to misconfigured AMI selection in AWS environments:\nThe retrieval of AMIs by software using the ec2:DescribeImages API without specifying an owner\nThe use of wildcards by scripts instead of specific AMI IDs\nThe practice of some infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform using \"most_recent=true,\" automatically picking the latest AMI that matches the filter.\nThese conditions allow the attackers to insert malicious AMIs in the selection process by naming the resource similarly to a trusted one. Without specifying an an owner, AWS returns all matching AMIs, including the attacker's.\nIf the parameter \"most_recent\" is set to \"true,\" the victim's system provides the latest AMIs added to the marketplace, which may include a malicious one that has a name similar to a legitimate entry.\nDemonstrating the retrieval of a malicious instead of a trusted AMI\nSource: DataDog\nBasically, all an attacker needs to do is publish an AMI with a name that fits the pattern used by trusted owners, making it easy for users to select it and launch an EC2 instance.\nThe whoAMI attack does not require breaching the target's AWS account. The attacker only needs an AWS account to publish their backdoored AMI to the public Community AMI catalog and strategically choose a name that mimics the AMIs of their targets.\nDatadog says that based on their telemetry, about 1% of the organizations the company monitors are vulnerable to whoAMI attacks but \"this vulnerability likely affects thousands of distinct AWS accounts.\"\nAmazon's response and defense measures\nDataDog researchers notified Amazon about the flaw and the company confirmed that internal non-production systems were vulnerable to the whoAMI attack.\nThe issue was fixed last year on September 19, and on December 1st AWS introduced a new security control named 'Allowed AMIs' allowing customers to create an allow list of trusted AMI providers.\nAWS stated that the vulnerability was not exploited outside of the security researchers' tests, so no customer data was compromised via whoAMI attacks.\nAmazon advises customers to always specify AMI owners when using the \"ec2:DescribeImages\" API and enable the 'Allowed AMIs' feature for additional protection.\nThe new feature is available via\nAWS Console → EC2 → Account Attributes → Allowed AMIs\n.\nStarting last November, Terraform 5.77 started serving warnings to users when \"most_recent = true\" is used without an owner filter, with stricter enforcement planned for future releases (6.0).\nSystem admins must audit their configuration and update their code on AMI sources (Terraform, AWS CLI, Python Boto3, and Go AWS SDK) for safe AMI retrieval.\nTo check if untrusted AMIs are currently in use, enable AWS Audit Mode through 'Allowed AMIs,' and switch to 'Enforcement Mode' to block them.\nDataDog has also released a scanner to check AWS account for instances created from untrusted AMIs, available in\nthis GitHub repository\n.\nRelated Articles:\nAmazon Redshift gets new default settings to prevent data breaches\nRansomware abuses Amazon AWS feature to encrypt S3 buckets\nHow attackers abuse S3 Bucket Namesquatting — And How to Stop Them\nNew Syncjacking attack hijacks devices using Chrome extensions\nHackers exploit critical Aviatrix Controller RCE flaw in attacks"

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nCybersecurity experts weigh in on the red flags flying around the new Department of Government Efficiency's handling of the mountains of US data it now has access to, potentially without basic information security protections in place.\nFebruary 13, 2025\nElon Musk and his band of programmers have been granted access to data from US government systems to aid their stated efforts to slash the size of government, leaving cybersecurity experts deeply concerned over how all of this sensitive data is being secured.\nSo far, Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have accessed the computer systems of the Department of Treasury, as well as classified data from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which holds sensitive data on millions of federal workers — including, notably, security clearances — and has subsequently blocked key government officials from further accessing those personnel systems, according to a bombshell from Reuters.\nThe DOGE team reportedly also sent only partially redacted names of CIA personnel through a nonclassified email account, according to The New York Times, and Forbes reported that the team is feeding Department of Education data and Department of Energy data into an artificial intelligence model to identify inefficiencies, with an unknown level of information security protections in place. Moving forward, there are more plans to use AI to run the government. Reportedly, DOGE is also creating its own chatbot to run the federal government's General Services Administration, called GSAi.\nRelated:How Public & Private Sectors Can Better Align Cyber Defense\nDOGE has not yet replied to a request for comment from Dark Reading, but this reporter did ask cybersecurity experts for their thoughts on the unraveling of cybersecurity protections around federal government data. The comments below were gathered from cybersecurity law and policy expert Stewart Baker; Evan Dornbush, former NSA cybersecurity expert; and Willy Leichter, chief marketing officer with AppSOC.\n\nStewart Baker: Of course DOGE's rapid-fire smartest-guy-in-the-room approach to government reform raises security risks, especially if DOGE is coding changes into government systems. The rule for software design is \"fast, secure, and cheap — pick any two.\" Elon Musk has achieved enormous success in business by eliminating procedures and organizations and parts that the experts said were essential.\nHe's running Twitter/X with one-fifth the employees it had before he took over. He has dramatically simplified rocket design, enabling faster manufacturing and turnaround. So it's no surprise he'd want to challenge and ignore a lot of government rules, including those that protect information security. But the security rules protect against active adversaries. Taking shortcuts that seem sensible to smart guys in a hurry could lead to serious problems down the road, and it may take us a while to realize the damage. \nRelated:President Trump to Nominate Former RNC Official as National Cyber Director\nMusk's impatience is understandable, though. I'm sure that there are employees using the security rules to slow him down or thwart him entirely. It's important that DOGE take security seriously, but also that its critics be very specific about the security risks they see, rather than using cybersecurity as an all-purpose tool for delay.\nEvan Dornbush: It's quite reasonable for people to be concerned, even alarmed, at how DOGE is currently operating. For any organization, the process of securing data is often developed over years, taking in myriad perspectives to ensure confidential data is minimally accessible, and that logging can recreate a picture of accessed data, or data in transit, when required.\nWilly Leichter: The actions of DOGE, in just its first couple of weeks, is the largest, deliberate trampling of government security protocols in cyber history. The arrogance, deliberate ignorance, malevolence, and sheer stupidity of this gang of untrained and unaccountable hackers roaming sensitive government networks is staggering. If this type of activity happened in the private sector, with this level of highly sensitive and regulated information, we would be talking about massive fines and personal criminal liability for all the actors involved.\nRelated:Content Credentials Technology Verifies Image, Video Authenticity\nThis could not be happening at a more precarious time for government cybersecurity. China and other countries have been ramping up attacks, already targeting many of the same networks, stealing data and planting the tools to cripple our critical infrastructure. Putting this data in inexperienced and reckless hands, while dismantling defense systems, demoralizing our most experienced experts, disbanding public-private advisory groups, and defunding critical cyber initiatives will inevitably have disastrous consequences. The only questions are whether this will cost us billions versus trillions in losses, and whether it will take years versus decades to recover.\nBaker: Sending the names of CIA employees in unclassified channels is very risky, even if the names are only first name, final initial. Given all the other sources of information about individuals, reconstructing full names is something a hostile foreign service would seek to do, so they'll be trying to intercept the list of names. My question is why DOGE thinks that's a risk worth taking? Will the list of names do DOGE any good? I assume the request was tied to possible layoffs at the CIA, but did DOGE really need the names to decide who to lay off? If not, this was an unnecessary risk and irresponsible.\nDornbush: Lack of transparency. Right now, it seems like questions are being asked to DOGE about how it is securing the data it accessed from government sites. It is unclear if anyone from DOGE is even replying. Minimizing risk of unauthorized access requires whole teams of specialists, augmented by purpose-built hardware and software. Even if it is ultimately determined that DOGE does have authorization to access this data, [if] it has physically removed the data from these hardened and professionally monitored networks, how is DOGE ensuring the data is responsibly protected from its own compromise or disclosure? How is it able to certify that the data is destroyed once it is no longer required?\nLeichter: The DOGE team has disregarded nearly every foundational security principle taught in the first week of a cybersecurity course — assuming they ever took one.\nThese include forcing entry to restricted and classified systems without proper authorization. Officials doing their sworn duty to prevent this were put on administrative leave. DOGE members were also given excessive access to sensitive systems that went far beyond what was necessary for their advisory roles. Also, DOGE personnel with controversial backgrounds, blatant lack of qualifications, and obvious conflicts of interest went through no legitimate vetting by qualified government agencies.\nDisplaying a disregard for security protocols, DOGE operatives bypassed standard security measures, accessing systems without authorization and ignoring protocols meant to protect sensitive data, [and were provided] unauthorized access to personal data of federal employees and US citizens, which violates multiple privacy laws, even if the data is not leaked.\nBaker: DOGE should acknowledge its responsibility to maintain the security of data it handles, and its security procedures should be subject to audit. Judicial rulings that try to protect the data by denying DOGE access should be lifted.\nDornbush: DOGE securing the data is an impossibility. DOGE is newly formed. The data it is looking at sat behind years of accumulated people, products, and policy that specialize only in the security of that data set. Removing the data from these sites evaporates that progress, and ironically, is extremely inefficient and wasteful. If you want to see this data, fine. Work from the office.\nLeichter: It's probably impossible to undo this type of damage. The data needs to be destroyed, all inappropriate access revoked, and the highly trained government custodians need to be allowed to return to work and do their jobs. All of this seems highly unlikely, as the administration is deliberately disabling as much of the federal government as possible and replacing highly trained experts with incompetent political hires.\nBaker:  I'm still waiting to hear what DOGE's infosec strategy and commitments are.\nDornbush: What DOGE is purportedly doing is important and has merit. I'd love to know what the infosec strategy is. Right now, it seems like sharing the security steps they are taking with the public is not a priority.\nLeichter: If DOGE has a strategy, it has kept it secret. Any legitimate government agency would have a well-documented strategy, public input, and defined objectives that align with larger goals. The only discernable strategy of DOGE and the administration is to dismantle as much of the government as quickly as possible, purging experience, which they seem to view as a liability.\nThe only question is how quickly judicial intervention can kick in and whether it will be ignored. The one thing that might influence this administration is widespread public condemnation after the next major security incident, which is probably lurking right around the corner. That’s a terrible security strategy.\nWould you like to weigh in on any of the above four questions?

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nPivoting from prior cyber espionage, the threat group deployed its backdoor tool set to ultimately push out RA World malware, demanding $2 million from its victim.\nFebruary 13, 2025\nNEWS BRIEF\nA recent RA World ransomware attack utilized a tool set that took researchers by surprise, given that it has been associated with China-based espionage actors in the past.\nAccording to Symantec, the attack occurred in late 2024. The tool set includes a legitimate Toshiba executable named toshdpdb.exe that deploys on a victim's device. It then connects to a malicious dynamic link library (DLL) that deploys a payload containing a PlugX backdoor.\nThe threat actors in this case used the tool kit to ultimately deploy RA World ransomware inside an unnamed Asian software and services company, demanding a ransom of $2 million. No initial infection vector was found. However, the attacker claimed they compromised the victim's network by exploiting a Palo Alto PAN-OS vulnerability (CVE-2024-0012), according to Symantec.\n\"The attacker then said administrative credentials were obtained from the company's intranet before stealing Amazon S3 cloud credentials from its Veeam server, using them to steal data from its S3 buckets before encrypting computers,\" added the researchers, who hypothesized that based on tactics, techniques, and procedures, the attacker could be China-linked Emperor Dragonfly, aka Bronze Starlight, a group that has been known to deploy ransomware to obscure intellectual property theft in the past.\nSymantec researchers noted that prior intrusions using the tool set were against the foreign ministry of a Southeastern European country, the government of another, two Southeast Asian government ministries, and a Southeast Asian telecoms operator. Each of these attacks occurred between last July and January, and all were espionage-related, with no ransomware component.\n\"While tools associated with China-based espionage groups are often shared resources, many aren't publicly available and aren't usually associated with cybercrime activity,\" said the researchers in a posting this week.\nRead more about:\nKristina Beek, Associate Editor, Dark Reading\n\nSkilled writer and editor covering cybersecurity for Dark Reading.\nYou May Also Like\nSecuring the Remote Workforce\nEmerging Technologies and Their Impact on CISO Strategies\nHow CISOs Navigate the Regulatory and Compliance Maze\nWhere Does Outsourcing Make Sense for Your Organization?\nShift Left: Integrating Security into the Software Development Lifecycle\n[Conference] Black Hat USA - August 2-7 - Learn More\n[Conference] Black Hat Asia - April 1-4 - Learn More\n[Dark Reading Virtual Event] Cybersecurity's Most Promising New and Emerging Technologies\nThe State of Firewall Security: Challenges, Risks, and Solutions for Modern Networks\nIndustrial Networks in the Age of Digitalization\nZero-Trust Adoption Driven by Data Protection, Cloud Access Control, and Regulatory Compliance Requirements\nThreat Hunting's Evolution: From On-Premises to the Cloud\nHow Enterprises Secure Their Applications\nSecuring the Remote Workforce\nEmerging Technologies and Their Impact on CISO Strategies\nHow CISOs Navigate the Regulatory and Compliance Maze\nWhere Does Outsourcing Make Sense for Your Organization?\nShift Left: Integrating Security into the Software Development Lifecycle\nTop 10 CI/CD Security Risks: The Technical Guide\nThe State of Cloud Native Security Report 2024\nSocial Engineering: New Tricks, New Threats, New Defenses\nUnderstanding Social Engineering Attacks and What To Do About Them\nThe State of Asset Security: Uncovering Alarming Gaps & Unexpected Exposures\n[Conference] Black Hat USA - August 2-7 - Learn More\n[Conference] Black Hat Asia - April 1-4 - Learn More\n[Dark Reading Virtual Event] Cybersecurity's Most Promising New and Emerging Technologies\nCopyright © 2025.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nWith investment in cybersecurity capabilities and proactive measures to address emerging challenges, we can work together to navigate the complexities of combating cybercrime.\nFebruary 13, 2025\nCOMMENTARY\nCybercrime isn't just an inconvenience — it's a serious threat capable of disrupting essential infrastructure, endangering public safety, and shaking the foundations of our financial systems and economy.\nWe've all seen the headlines in recent years — from a cyberattack on an energy pipeline that disrupted the fuel supply across parts of the US to a large-scale ransomware attack on a health insurance provider that led to a massive leak of personal data. Uncovering and combating cybercrime remains a complex challenge for many reasons, but chief among them is the disconnect in data collection, sharing, and collaboration between the public and private sectors.\nCritical infrastructure, essential utilities like power and water, local municipalities and services (think 911 and EMS), small and midsize businesses, and healthcare — not one of these is off-limits to cybercriminals. And as threat actors become more aggressive, our defenses must keep up.\nThe US government has a duty to take the lead in defending the nation against cybercrime. But while there's been some progress over the past few decades toward stronger national leadership on cybersecurity, the truth is that there's been a lot of added red tape with no clear responsible party.\nOver the past 25 years, organizations like the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have been created. They're producing valuable alerts and educational resources on growing cyber threats. That's all great, except for one thing. Despite decades of progress on building federal alignment around cybersecurity as a key priority, there's still no clear voice leading the charge. Meanwhile, cybercriminals are staying one step ahead, moving faster and more strategically than the agencies tasked with safeguarding citizens' cybersecurity.\nThat brings us to March 2024, when the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) released a report calling for the creation of a stand-alone military Cyber Force. This team would run Pentagon cyber-defense efforts from within the Department of the Army and help set the stage for a more unified defense strategy over the next five to 10 years. The report is rooted in feedback from over 70 active and retired military cyber experts who all seem to agree on one thing: Cybercrime poses a serious and growing threat to national security, and it's time to do something about it.\nAt the highest levels of government, the US has made a strong push to identify, address, and communicate emerging and critical cyber threats. And now, it's on both the public and private sectors to bridge the gap and work together. But the big question we've yet to fully address is whether there's sufficient collaboration between the public and private sectors and if our response times are suffering because of it.\nTake March 2021, for example. Microsoft flagged that a hacking group exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities targeting Microsoft Exchange Server software. A month later, the Justice Department stepped in with a court-authorized effort to disrupt ongoing exploitation. And the patches? Those finally rolled out another month later, after cybercriminals had plenty of time to exploit the vulnerabilities and infiltrate organizations.\nFast forward to the ConnectWise ScreenConnect vulnerability that surfaced last year. This time, the private sector was ahead of the game, with guidance and fixes hitting the headlines quickly. But, when it came to government action, CISA issued its advisory days after the vulnerability was announced.\nProgress has definitely been made over the past two decades — there's no denying that. But there's still room to tighten the partnership between public and private sectors regarding cybersecurity. So, how do we achieve that?\nTo build stronger defenses for the future, we need to respond to these kinds of incidents in minutes and hours — not days, weeks, or months. There has to be a faster, simpler way for leaders from both the public and private sectors to connect, share insights, and issue clear instructions for vulnerabilities, patches, and more.\nI've pinpointed five key areas that, in my opinion, need serious attention to improve collaboration between public and private sectors:\nInsights: If we unify data collection, analysis, and sharing, we can give policymakers and practitioners a clearer picture of cybercrime — its scope, its patterns, and where to hit back with precision.\nData: Taking that one step further and sharing more data between agencies and the private sector would make a tangible difference in how prepared organizations and municipalities are for known and emerging vulnerabilities.\nPolicy and legislation: Here's a practical one — streamline classification processes. Using a common language for cybercrimes would cut down on miscommunication and confusion.\nCollaboration: Create task forces between government and industry that scale to the highest levels of government and the gravest threats, responding in a coordinated, powerful way.\nHacking back: There are pros and cons to this option, but I'd like to see the federal government explore how to build skills to hack the hackers, and somewhat importantly, what the rules of engagement would be for companies and local governments. The notion has been introduced to the government, but to date, no laws have been passed yet to push it forward.\nThe fight against cybercrime is constantly evolving, and keeping up will take all of us working together and thinking creatively. Recent initiatives prove that when we harness technology, coordinate effectively, and build stronger public-private partnerships, we can significantly bolster our defenses, reducing the impact of cybercrime on individuals and institutions. It's no easy task — staying ahead requires vigilance, adaptability, and a willingness to tackle uncharted challenges. But together, through collaboration and determination, we can tackle cybercrime challenges head-on, creating a safer and more secure future for everyone.\nChris Henderson\nSenior Director of Threat Operations, Huntress\nChris Henderson runs Threat Operations and Internal Security at Huntress.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nBreaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa and the Asia Pacific\nJapan is on a mission to catch up to the US standard of national cyber preparedness, and its new legislation is a measure intended to stop escalating Chinese cyber-espionage efforts, experts say.\nFebruary 13, 2025\nThe Japanese government is on a mission to catch up to US national cybersecurity preparedness standards and has just passed bold legislation aimed at bolstering the country's cyber-response capabilities.\nTogether, the two articles of legislation constitute what's referred to as the Active Cyber Defense Bill, which enables the Japanese government to take more aggressive measures to stop cyberattacks before they can cause widespread damage.\nAfter some delays in 2024, the bill was finally presented to, and approved by, the country's leading Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) last month. On Feb. 7, it was approved by the Cabinet (which consists of the prime minister and up to 19 other ministers), and was in turn submitted to the National Diet, Japan's parliament.\nThe passage of the law follows a warning in January from Japan's national police that Chinese state-backed threat actor MirrorFace has been committing wide-scale cyber espionage since 2019 in an effort to steal Japan's national security secrets.\n\"The country is grappling with a mix of state-sponsored attacks, particularly from neighboring nations, and criminal activity targeting its advanced industrial base,\" Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains. \"Ransomware, supply chain attacks, and IP espionage (e.g., MirrorFace) are all high on the list, as are concerns around prepositioning attacks against critical infrastructure and the defense industry. Its move toward legalizing 'active cyber defense' is a bold step and, to me, is a reflection of the country's delicate geopolitical and geographic position.\"\nThe overhaul of Japan's cyber-readiness efforts dates back to April 2022 and is a wake-up call delivered to the country's leadership by former US Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair. He was sharply critical of the country's cybersecurity efforts, and this distressed Japanese lawmakers so much that his message left them in what is now known as \"Blair Shock.\"\nBlair told Tokyo's government a hard truth: that its cybersecurity preparedness just wasn't up to the standard of its allies in North America and Europe. To amend that, he suggested the government establish new positions and agencies equivalent to those in the US, such as the US Cyber Command and the executive position of National Cyber Director.\nThen-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's administration took the criticism to heart. As soon as it had the opportunity that December, it released a new National Security Strategy with new goals for improving cybersecurity response capabilities. Most notably, the government introduced what it called \"active\" cyber defense, \"for eliminating in advance the possibility of serious cyberattacks that may cause national security concerns to the Government and critical infrastructures and for preventing the spread of damage in case of such attacks, even if they do not amount to an armed attack.\" In short: identifying the source of a cyberattack early, and defeating it before it can cause serious harm.\nIn case that sounds a bit like government overreach, lawmakers have since clarified how exactly its active cyber defense will work.\nRoughly speaking, the first half of the Active Cyber Defense Bill defines the more passive changes Japan will implement in its national cyber posture.\nAmong other things, the bill establishes a cybersecurity council and a committee overseeing information gathering and analysis. It requires that critical infrastructure providers report cybersecurity incidents and imbues the prime minister's office with new power to collect certain relevant information through telecommunications providers. It also lays out restrictions on how the government can use that collected data and what sensitive information must be filtered out.\nThe second piece of legislation introduces more active measures for ensuring Japan's cyber defense.\nThe military will enjoy new powers to actively protect both its systems and certain systems associated with the US military presence in its borders. And, notably, law enforcement will be hiring new \"cyber harm prevention officers,\" whose job will be to proactively address major cyber threats by, for example, shutting down enemy servers during an incident. When time is short, the prevention officers may act even without explicit approval from relevant oversight bodies.\nEllis says that \"the idea of 'vigilante hacking' is controversial but not without merit in specific, controlled scenarios. It signals a shift toward a more proactive stance, which is arguably overdue given the evolving threat landscape.\"\nRead more about:\nNate Nelson, Contributing Writer\n\nNate Nelson is a writer based in New York City.

        "Content": "In mid-March 2024, KrebsOnSecurity revealed that the founder of the personal data removal service Onerep also founded dozens of people-search companies. Shortly after that investigation was published, Mozilla said it would stop bundling Onerep with the Firefox browser and wind down its partnership with the company. But nearly a year later, Mozilla is still promoting it to Firefox users.\nMozilla offers Onerep to Firefox users on a subscription basis as part of Mozilla Monitor Plus. Launched in 2018 under the name Firefox Monitor, Mozilla Monitor also checks data from the website Have I Been Pwned? to let users know when their email addresses or password are leaked in data breaches.\nThe ink on that partnership agreement had barely dried before KrebsOnSecurity published a story showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder Dimitiri Shelest launched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called Nuwber that sells background reports on people. This seemed to contradict Onerep’s stated motto, “We believe that no one should compromise personal online security and get a profit from it.”\nShelest released a lengthy statement (PDF) wherein he acknowledged maintaining an ownership stake in Nuwber, a consumer data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he started Onerep.\nOnerep.com CEO and founder Dimitri Shelest, as pictured on the “about” page of onerep.com.\nShelest maintained that Nuwber has “zero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep,” and said any other old domains that may be found and associated with his name are no longer being operated by him.\n“I get it,” Shelest wrote. “My affiliation with a people search business may look odd from the outside. In truth, if I hadn’t taken that initial path with a deep dive into how people search sites work, Onerep wouldn’t have the best tech and team in the space. Still, I now appreciate that we did not make this more clear in the past and I’m aiming to do better in the future.”\nWhen asked to comment on the findings, Mozilla said then that although customer data was never at risk, the outside financial interests and activities of Onerep’s CEO did not align with their values.\n“We’re working now to solidify a transition plan that will provide customers with a seamless experience and will continue to put their interests first,” Mozilla said.\nIn October 2024, Mozilla published a statement saying the search for a different provider was taking longer than anticipated.\n“While we continue to evaluate vendors, finding a technically excellent and values-aligned partner takes time,” Mozilla wrote. “While we continue this search, Onerep will remain the backend provider, ensuring that we can maintain uninterrupted services while we continue evaluating new potential partners that align more closely with Mozilla’s values and user expectations. We are conducting thorough diligence to find the right vendor.”\nAsked for an update, Mozilla said the search for a replacement partner continues.\n“The work’s ongoing but we haven’t found the right alternative yet,” Mozilla said in an emailed statement. “Our customers’ data remains safe, and since the product provides a lot of value to our subscribers, we’ll continue to offer it during this process.”\nIt’s a win-win for Mozilla that they’ve received accolades for their principled response while continuing to partner with Onerep almost a year later. But if it takes so long to find a suitable replacement, what does that say about the personal data removal industry itself?\nOnerep appears to be working in partnership with another problematic people-search service: Radaris, which has a history of ignoring opt-out requests or failing to honor them. A week before breaking the story about Onerep, KrebsOnSecurity published research showing the co-founders of Radaris were two native Russian brothers who’d built a vast network of affiliate marketing programs and consumer data broker services.\nLawyers for the Radaris co-founders threatened to sue KrebsOnSecurity unless that story was retracted in full, claiming the founders were in fact Ukrainian and that our reporting had defamed the brothers by associating them with the actions of Radaris. Instead, we published a follow-up investigation which showed that not only did the brothers from Russia create Radaris, for many years they issued press releases quoting a fictitious CEO seeking money from investors.\nSeveral readers have shared emails they received from Radaris after attempting to remove their personal data, and those messages show Radaris has been promoting Onerep.\nAn email from Radaris promoting Onerep.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Thursday 13th of February 2025 03:14 PM \r\n         \nYour email address will not be published.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nMillions of uninformed users have flocked to DeepSeek and share personal information without considering security or privacy risks. \nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThe buzzword of this month is DeepSeek. The emergence of this Chinese AI company, which reportedly developed its R1 chatbot at a fraction of the cost of competitors like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, sent ripples through the U.S. tech stock market and sparked discussions on AI infrastructure costs and competitiveness. However, a more alarming issue emerged, as millions of uninformed users, including government employees, flocked to DeepSeek’s website, registering and sharing personal information without considering security or privacy risks. This lack of caution is common when it comes to social media and Internet apps. Despite security awareness training, users often drop their guard when engaging with these platforms, making them prime targets for cyber adversaries. Attackers exploit the data harvested from these applications to lay the foundation for sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\n\n\nMany users are blinded by the immediate benefits of new platforms like DeepSeek, disregarding privacy policies upon signing up. If they did review these policies, they would realize DeepSeek collects a vast array of data—far surpassing even TikTok, a known national security concern. In addition to user input (text, audio, chat history, and uploaded files), DeepSeek automatically collects IP addresses, unique device identifiers, device model and operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, system language, as well as user IDs and cookies. Much of this data is unnecessary for AI query purposes, raising significant privacy concerns.\n\n\n\nThe Threat of Social Media and Internet Apps\nSocial media and Internet apps present a major blind spot in cybersecurity. Because these platforms often display user posts publicly, attackers can silently gather data without the user’s knowledge. Information shared on social media can be exploited to guess passwords, impersonate individuals, or craft targeted phishing attacks.\n\n\n\nAttackers often target businesses, as they offer higher rewards. A common attack strategy involves:\n\n\n\n\nTarget Selection – Reviewing LinkedIn for high-value corporate employees and low-privilege users who may be more susceptible to social engineering.\nData Collection – Scouring social media for personal details such as pet names, favorite sports teams, or education history—clues that can be used to guess passwords or answer security questions.\nAttack Execution – Deploying phishing emails, brand impersonation, malware, and social engineering tactics to gain access to credentials, leading to potential data breaches.\n\nHow to Minimize Risk Exposure\nTo reduce security risks associated with social media and Internet apps, follow these key measures:\n\n\n\n\nStudy Privacy Policies\n\nReview the service provider’s privacy policy to assess what data is collected and conduct a risk evaluation.\n\n\nStrengthen Account SecurityUse strong, unique passwords for each account.Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible.Avoid sharing login credentials.\n\nRegularly update passwords and security questions.\n\n\nProtect Personal InformationLimit personal details shared online, especially when interacting with AI-driven platforms.Adjust privacy settings to control who can view your information.Disable location sharing when unnecessary.\n\nAvoid posting sensitive details such as addresses, phone numbers, financial data, or business IP.\n\n\nBe Cautious of Phishing and ScamsAvoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages.Verify the authenticity of friend requests and direct messages.\n\nBe alert to fake profiles and impersonators.\n\n\nReview App PermissionsDownload apps only from trusted sources (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).Regularly review and adjust app permissions (e.g., camera, microphone, location access).\n\nRevoke access to unused apps.\n\n\nKeep Software UpdatedRegularly update social media apps and devices to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\nInstall security updates for your operating system and browser.\n\n\nMonitor Account ActivityCheck account activity and login history for unauthorized access.\n\nEnable notifications for unrecognized logins or security breaches.\n\n\nUse Secure Messaging and EncryptionUse end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp.\n\nAvoid sharing sensitive data through social media chats.\n\n\n\nBy implementing these measures, users can significantly reduce their risk exposure and better protect their personal and professional information from cyber threats.\n\t\t\t\nMany users are blinded by the immediate benefits of new platforms like DeepSeek, disregarding privacy policies upon signing up.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nAn analysis conducted by SecurityWeek shows that 405 cybersecurity-related mergers and acquisitions were announced in 2024.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nA total of 405 cybersecurity-related merger and acquisition deals were announced in 2024, the smallest number since SecurityWeek started tracking M&A deals in 2021. \n\n\nHowever, there was a surge in cybersecurity M&A deal volume in the second half of 2024. The number of deals in that period reached 227, which is the highest number of transactions since the first half of 2022.\n\n\n\n\nSecurityWeek’s analysis shows that of the 405 deals, 269 involved pure-play cybersecurity firms. The other transactions involved companies whose offering includes, but is not limited to, security. \n\n\n\nA geographical analysis shows that a majority of deals (286) involved North American companies, followed by Europe with 124 cybersecurity M&A deals. There are no significant changes compared to 2023. \n\n\n\n\nIn terms of countries, the biggest percentage of deals involved companies in the United States, followed by the UK, Australia, Israel, Canada, and Germany. Compared to the previous year, the UK saw a significant increase in the number of acquisitions, from 48 to 67, while Ireland and Sweden saw fewer cybersecurity deals — both countries with less than 10 deals in 2024.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, financial terms were disclosed for 68 cybersecurity acquisitions, for a total value of $50.75 billion. Of these, 52 deals involved pure-play cybersecurity companies for a total disclosed value of $28 billion. \n\n\n\nIn comparison, in 2023, financial details were disclosed for 58 deals for a total disclosed value of $50.4 billion. Financial information was made public for 41 deals involving pure-play cybersecurity companies, for a total disclosed value of $14.3 billion.  \n\n\n\nEleven of the deals announced in 2024 exceeded $1 billion, including Gen Digital’s acquisition of MoneyLion ($1 billion), Mastercard’s acquisition of Recorded Future ($2.7 billion), Salesforce’s acquisition of Own ($1.9 billion), CyberArk’s acquisition of Venafi ($1.54 billion), Hg’s acquisition of AuditBoard ($3 billion), Thoma Bravo’s acquisition of Darktrace ($5.3 billion), and HPE’s acquisition of Juniper Networks ($14 billion). It’s worth noting that the HPE/Juniper deal may not go through. \n\n\n\nEight of the $1 billion+ deals involved pure cybersecurity companies. In the previous year, only six deals were valued at more than $1 billion, and four of them involved companies that offer only security solutions.\n\n\n\n\nOf the 25 mergers and acquisitions ranging between $100 million and $1 billion, 22 involved pure cybersecurity companies. In 2023, there were 20 M&A deals in this price range, including 15 involving pure security firms. \n\n\n\nOur data shows that 119 deals involved managed security solutions providers (MSSPs) in 2024. This includes product distributors and companies that offer other products and services in addition to cybersecurity. Of these MSSPs, only 43 were pure cybersecurity providers.\n\n\n\nThe number of deals involving MSSPs dropped in 2024 compared to 2023, when there were 155 such transactions. \n\n\n\nWhile it’s important to keep track of MSSP deals as these companies play a significant role in the cybersecurity industry, we are tracking them separately in an effort to get a better view of the other categories.    Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nExcluding MSSPs, the category with the highest number of transactions was governance, risk management and compliance (GRC), which saw 68 deals in 2024, exactly the same number as in 2023. In addition to companies offering GRC solutions and services, this category includes assessment, audit, vulnerability management, penetration testing, attack surface management, and cyberinsurance.  \n\n\n\n\nAfter GRC, the highest number of deals involved companies offering data protection solutions and services, with 44 transactions in 2024. Data protection was in the fourth spot in 2022, but then dropped to the eighth position in 2023, and it’s now back in the top 3, with nearly twice as many deals as in the previous year. \n\n\n\nNetwork security takes the third position, the same as in the two previous years, with roughly 40 deals every year.\n\n\n\nDozens of deals involved incident response companies, a category that includes SOAR, SIEM, SOC, and forensics. The number of transactions involving incident response firms increased from 26 in 2023 to 38 in 2024. \n\n\n\nThe same number of deals, 38, involved government contractors, which is roughly the same as in the previous year. However, a larger percentage when compared to 2023 (nearly half) are pure cybersecurity companies. \n\n\n\nApplication security firms were involved in 31 deals last year, compared to 18 in 2023. \n\n\n\nIdentity-related solutions and services providers however dropped from second place in 2023 (41 deals) to seventh place in 2024 (28) deals. \n\n\n\nPrivate equity firms were also significantly less active in terms of M&As in 2024. Only two dozen deals involved private equity companies, compared to 37 in 2023.  \n\n\n\nOne area that saw an increase was industrial, with 16 deals, up from 9 in 2023. On the other hand, consumer security firms were involved in only two deals, down from nine in 2023, and consulting dropped from 24 deals in 2023 to 12 deals in 2024. \n\n\n\nThere haven’t been any significant changes in the number of deals involving cloud security, threat intelligence, fraud, training, and web and email security companies. \n\n\n\nIn this year’s report we have also added an AI category. Eight deals added to our M&A database involved AI security companies. We also created a separate category for blockchain security, with three deals seen in 2024. \n\n\n\nThe ‘specialized’ category, which in 2024 included 27 deals, covers firms that provide highly focused cybersecurity services. This can include services related to accounting, specific hardware, orchestration, physical events, certification, surveillance, insider threat, healthcare, media, maritime, and cryptocurrency.   \n\n\n\nMonthly summaries of 2024 cybersecurity M&A deals: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December.\n\n\n\nMethodology: The data was collected through news distribution services, Google searches and pitches from PR companies. The data includes companies that issued press releases announcing or mentioning acquisitions, as well as deals that have been privately reported to SecurityWeek. All deals that had a cybersecurity component have been taken into account for this study. Mergers and acquisitions that did not have an English-language announcement may not be included. The data could also include some deals that may have not been completed after they were announced. \nThe GRC category includes governance, compliance, risk management, audit, assessment, vulnerability management, penetration testing, attack surface management, offensive security, and cyber insurance. Network security includes endpoint security, MDR, XDR, NDR, and SASE. Identity includes IAM, PAM, secure access, authentication, and authorization. Incident response includes SOAR, SIEM, SOC, and forensics. ‘Other (specialized)’ includes hardware, quantum, payment, healthcare, PR, education, certification, design, workforce, communications, and automotive. Data protection includes encryption/cryptography, VPN, privacy, backup and blockchain. MSSP includes cybersecurity solution distributors and companies that do not develop their own products or solutions.\n\nHowever, there was a surge in cybersecurity M&A deal volume in the second half of 2024. The number of deals in that period reached 227, which is the highest number of transactions since the first half of 2022.\n\n\n\n\nSecurityWeek’s analysis shows that of the 405 deals, 269 involved pure-play cybersecurity firms. The other transactions involved companies whose offering includes, but is not limited to, security. \n\n\n\nA geographical analysis shows that a majority of deals (286) involved North American companies, followed by Europe with 124 cybersecurity M&A deals. There are no significant changes compared to 2023. \n\n\n\n\nIn terms of countries, the biggest percentage of deals involved companies in the United States, followed by the UK, Australia, Israel, Canada, and Germany.

However, a larger percentage when compared to 2023 (nearly half) are pure cybersecurity companies. \n\n\n\nApplication security firms were involved in 31 deals last year, compared to 18 in 2023. \n\n\n\nIdentity-related solutions and services providers however dropped from second place in 2023 (41 deals) to seventh place in 2024 (28) deals. \n\n\n\nPrivate equity firms were also significantly less active in terms of M&As in 2024. Only two dozen deals involved private equity companies, compared to 37 in 2023.  \n\n\n\nOne area that saw an increase was industrial, with 16 deals, up from 9 in 2023. On the other hand, consumer security firms were involved in only two deals, down from nine in 2023, and consulting dropped from 24 deals in 2023 to 12 deals in 2024. \n\n\n\nThere haven’t been any significant changes in the number of deals involving cloud security, threat intelligence, fraud, training, and web and email security companies. \n\n\n\nIn this year’s report we have also added an AI category. Eight deals added to our M&A database involved AI security companies. We also created a separate category for blockchain security, with three deals seen in 2024. \n\n\n\nThe ‘specialized’ category, which in 2024 included 27 deals, covers firms that provide highly focused cybersecurity services. This can include services related to accounting, specific hardware, orchestration, physical events, certification, surveillance, insider threat, healthcare, media, maritime, and cryptocurrency.   \n\n\n\nMonthly summaries of 2024 cybersecurity M&A deals: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December.\n\n\n\nMethodology: The data was collected through news distribution services, Google searches and pitches from PR companies. The data includes companies that issued press releases announcing or mentioning acquisitions, as well as deals that have been privately reported to SecurityWeek. All deals that had a cybersecurity component have been taken into account for this study. Mergers and acquisitions that did not have an English-language announcement may not be included. The data could also include some deals that may have not been completed after they were announced. \nThe GRC category includes governance, compliance, risk management, audit, assessment, vulnerability management, penetration testing, attack surface management, offensive security, and cyber insurance. Network security includes endpoint security, MDR, XDR, NDR, and SASE. Identity includes IAM, PAM, secure access, authentication, and authorization. Incident response includes SOAR, SIEM, SOC, and forensics. ‘Other (specialized)’ includes hardware, quantum, payment, healthcare, PR, education, certification, design, workforce, communications, and automotive. Data protection includes encryption/cryptography, VPN, privacy, backup and blockchain. MSSP includes cybersecurity solution distributors and companies that do not develop their own products or solutions.\n\nIn 2024, financial terms were disclosed for 68 cybersecurity acquisitions, for a total value of $50.75 billion. Of these, 52 deals involved pure-play cybersecurity companies for a total disclosed value of $28 billion. \n\n\n\nIn comparison, in 2023, financial details were disclosed for 58 deals for a total disclosed value of $50.4 billion. Financial information was made public for 41 deals involving pure-play cybersecurity companies, for a total disclosed value of $14.3 billion.  \n\n\n\nEleven of the deals announced in 2024 exceeded $1 billion, including Gen Digital’s acquisition of MoneyLion ($1 billion), Mastercard’s acquisition of Recorded Future ($2.7 billion), Salesforce’s acquisition of Own ($1.9 billion), CyberArk’s acquisition of Venafi ($1.54 billion), Hg’s acquisition of AuditBoard ($3 billion), Thoma Bravo’s acquisition of Darktrace ($5.3 billion), and HPE’s acquisition of Juniper Networks ($14 billion). It’s worth noting that the HPE/Juniper deal may not go through. \n\n\n\nEight of the $1 billion+ deals involved pure cybersecurity companies. In the previous year, only six deals were valued at more than $1 billion, and four of them involved companies that offer only security solutions.\n\n\n\n\nOf the 25 mergers and acquisitions ranging between $100 million and $1 billion, 22 involved pure cybersecurity companies. In 2023, there were 20 M&A deals in this price range, including 15 involving pure security firms. \n\n\n\nOur data shows that 119 deals involved managed security solutions providers (MSSPs) in 2024. This includes product distributors and companies that offer other products and services in addition to cybersecurity. Of these MSSPs, only 43 were pure cybersecurity providers.\n\n\n\nThe number of deals involving MSSPs dropped in 2024 compared to 2023, when there were 155 such transactions. \n\n\n\nWhile it’s important to keep track of MSSP deals as these companies play a significant role in the cybersecurity industry, we are tracking them separately in an effort to get a better view of the other categories.    Advertisement.

This includes product distributors and companies that offer other products and services in addition to cybersecurity. Of these MSSPs, only 43 were pure cybersecurity providers.\n\n\n\nThe number of deals involving MSSPs dropped in 2024 compared to 2023, when there were 155 such transactions. \n\n\n\nWhile it’s important to keep track of MSSP deals as these companies play a significant role in the cybersecurity industry, we are tracking them separately in an effort to get a better view of the other categories.    Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nExcluding MSSPs, the category with the highest number of transactions was governance, risk management and compliance (GRC), which saw 68 deals in 2024, exactly the same number as in 2023. In addition to companies offering GRC solutions and services, this category includes assessment, audit, vulnerability management, penetration testing, attack surface management, and cyberinsurance.  \n\n\n\n\nAfter GRC, the highest number of deals involved companies offering data protection solutions and services, with 44 transactions in 2024. Data protection was in the fourth spot in 2022, but then dropped to the eighth position in 2023, and it’s now back in the top 3, with nearly twice as many deals as in the previous year. \n\n\n\nNetwork security takes the third position, the same as in the two previous years, with roughly 40 deals every year.\n\n\n\nDozens of deals involved incident response companies, a category that includes SOAR, SIEM, SOC, and forensics. The number of transactions involving incident response firms increased from 26 in 2023 to 38 in 2024. \n\n\n\nThe same number of deals, 38, involved government contractors, which is roughly the same as in the previous year. However, a larger percentage when compared to 2023 (nearly half) are pure cybersecurity companies. \n\n\n\nApplication security firms were involved in 31 deals last year, compared to 18 in 2023. \n\n\n\nIdentity-related solutions and services providers however dropped from second place in 2023 (41 deals) to seventh place in 2024 (28) deals. \n\n\n\nPrivate equity firms were also significantly less active in terms of M&As in 2024. Only two dozen deals involved private equity companies, compared to 37 in 2023.  \n\n\n\nOne area that saw an increase was industrial, with 16 deals, up from 9 in 2023. On the other hand, consumer security firms were involved in only two deals, down from nine in 2023, and consulting dropped from 24 deals in 2023 to 12 deals in 2024. \n\n\n\nThere haven’t been any significant changes in the number of deals involving cloud security, threat intelligence, fraud, training, and web and email security companies. \n\n\n\nIn this year’s report we have also added an AI category. Eight deals added to our M&A database involved AI security companies. We also created a separate category for blockchain security, with three deals seen in 2024. \n\n\n\nThe ‘specialized’ category, which in 2024 included 27 deals, covers firms that provide highly focused cybersecurity services. This can include services related to accounting, specific hardware, orchestration, physical events, certification, surveillance, insider threat, healthcare, media, maritime, and cryptocurrency.   \n\n\n\nMonthly summaries of 2024 cybersecurity M&A deals: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December.\n\n\n\nMethodology: The data was collected through news distribution services, Google searches and pitches from PR companies.
