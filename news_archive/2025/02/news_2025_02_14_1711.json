        "Summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new type of name confusion attack called whoAMI that allows anyone who publishes an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with a specific name to gain code execution within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.\n\"If executed at scale, this attack could be used to gain access to thousands of accounts,\" Datadog Security Labs researcher Seth Art said in a report",

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new type of name confusion attack called whoAMI that allows anyone who publishes an Amazon Machine Image (\nAMI\n) with a specific name to gain code execution within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.\n\"If executed at scale, this attack could be used to gain access to thousands of accounts,\" Datadog Security Labs researcher Seth Art\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News. \"The vulnerable pattern can be found in many private and open source code repositories.\"\nAt its heart, the attack is a subset of a supply chain attack that involves publishing a malicious resource and tricking misconfigured software into using it instead of the legitimate counterpart.\nThe attack exploits the fact that anyone can AMI, which refers to a virtual machine image that's used to boot up Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in AWS, to the community catalog and the fact that developers could omit to mention the \"--owners\" attribute when\nsearching\nfor one via the ec2:DescribeImages API.\nPut differently, the name confusion attack requires the below three conditions to be met when a victim retrieves the AMI ID through the API -\nUse of the name filter,\nA failure to specify either the owner, owner-alias, or owner-id parameters,\nFetching the most the recently created image from the returned list of matching images (\"most_recent=true\")\nThis leads to a scenario where an attacker can create a malicious AMI with a name that matches the pattern specified in the search criteria, resulting in the creation of an EC2 instance using the threat actor's doppelgänger AMI.\nThis, in turn, grants remote code execution (RCE) capabilities on the instance, allowing the threat actors to initiate various post-exploitation actions.\nAll an attacker needs is an AWS account to publish their backdoored AMI to the public Community AMI catalog and opt for a name that matches the AMIs sought by their targets.\n\"It is very similar to a\ndependency confusion attack\n, except that in the latter, the malicious resource is a software dependency (such as a pip package), whereas in the whoAMI name confusion attack, the malicious resource is a virtual machine image,\" Art said.\nDatadog said roughly 1% of organizations monitored by the company were affected by the whoAMI attack, and that it found public examples of code written in Python, Go, Java, Terraform, Pulumi, and Bash shell using the vulnerable criteria.\nFollowing responsible disclosure on September 16, 2024, the issue was addressed by Amazon three days later. When reached for comment, AWS told The Hacker News that it did not find any evidence that the technique was abused in the wild.\n\"All AWS services are operating as designed. Based on extensive log analysis and monitoring, our investigation confirmed that the technique described in this research has only been executed by the authorized researchers themselves, with no evidence of usage by any other parties,\" the company said.\n\"This technique could affect customers who retrieve Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs via the ec2:DescribeImages API without specifying the owner value. In December 2024, we introduced Allowed AMIs, a new\naccount-wide setting\nthat enables customers to limit the discovery and use of AMIs within their AWS accounts. We recommend customers evaluate and implement this\nnew security control\n.\"\nAs of last November, HashiCorp Terraform has started issuing warnings to users when \"most_recent = true\" is used without an owner filter in terraform-provider-aws\nversion 5.77.0\n. The warning diagnostic is\nexpected\nto be upgraded to an error effective version 6.0.0.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The North Korean threat actor known as the\nLazarus Group\nhas been linked to a previously undocumented JavaScript implant named Marstech1 as part of limited targeted attacks against developers.\nThe active operation has been dubbed Marstech Mayhem by SecurityScorecard, with the malware delivered by means of an open-source repository hosted on GitHub that's associated with a profile named \"SuccessFriend.\" The profile, active since July 2024, is no longer accessible on the code hosting platform.\nThe implant is designed to collect system information, and can be embedded within websites and NPM packages, posing a supply chain risk. Evidence shows that the malware first emerged in late December 2024. The attack has amassed 233 confirmed victims across the U.S., Europe, and Asia.\n\"The profile mentioned web dev skills and learning blockchain which is in alignment to the interests of Lazarus,\" SecurityScorecard\nsaid\n. \"The threat actor was committing both pre-obfuscated and obfuscated payloads to various GitHub repositories.\"\nIn an interesting twist, the implant present in the GitHub repository has been found to be different from the version served directly from the command-and-control (C2) server at 74.119.194[.]129:3000/j/marstech1, indicating that it may be under active development.\nIts chief responsibility is to search across Chromium-based browser directories in various operating systems and alter extension-related settings, particularly those related to the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet. It's also capable of downloading additional payloads from the same server on port 3001.\nSome of the other wallets targeted by the malware include Exodus and Atomic on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The captured data is then exfiltrated to the C2 endpoint \"74.119.194[.]129:3000/uploads.\"\n\"The introduction of the Marstech1 implant, with its layered obfuscation techniques — from control flow flattening and dynamic variable renaming in JavaScript to multi-stage XOR decryption in Python — underscores the threat actor's sophisticated approach to evading both static and dynamic analysis,\" the company said.\nThe disclosure comes as Recorded Future revealed that at least three organizations in the broader cryptocurrency space, a market-making company, an online casino, and a software development company, were targeted as part of the\nContagious Interview\ncampaign between October and November 2024.\nThe cybersecurity firm is tracking the cluster under the name PurpleBravo, stating the\nNorth Korean IT workers\nbehind the\nfraudulent employment scheme\nare behind the cyber espionage threat. It's also tracked under the names CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan.\n\"Organizations that unknowingly hire North Korean IT workers may be in violation of international sanctions, exposing themselves to legal and financial repercussions,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"More critically, these workers almost certainly act as insider threats, stealing proprietary information, introducing backdoors, or facilitating larger cyber operations.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Social engineering\nis advancing fast, at the speed of generative AI. This is offering bad actors multiple new tools and techniques for researching, scoping, and exploiting organizations. In a recent communication, the FBI pointed out: 'As technology continues to evolve, so do cybercriminals' tactics.'\nThis article explores some of the impacts of this GenAI-fueled acceleration. And examines what it means for IT leaders responsible for managing defenses and mitigating vulnerabilities.\nMore realism, better pretexting, and multi-lingual attack scenarios\nTraditional social engineering methods usually involve impersonating someone the target knows. The attacker may hide behind email to communicate, adding some psychological triggers to boost the chances of a successful breach. Maybe a request to act urgently, so the target is less likely to pause and develop doubts. Or making the email come from an employee's CEO, hoping the employee's respect for authority means they won't question the message.\nIf using voice, then the attacker may instead pretend to be someone that the target hasn't spoken to (and would recognize the voice). Maybe pretending to be from another department or external partner.\nOf course, these methods often fall apart when the target wants to verify their identity in some way. Whether that's wanting to check their appearance, or how they write in a real-time chat.\nHowever, now that GenAI has entered the conversation, things have changed.\nThe rise in deepfake videos means that adversaries no longer need to hide behind keyboards. These blend genuine recordings to analyze and recreate a person's mannerisms and speech. Then it's simply a case of directing the deepfake to say anything, or using it as a digital mask that reproduces what the attacker says and does in front of the camera.\nThe rise in digital-first work, with remote workers used to virtual meetings, means it's easier to explain away possible warning signs. Unnatural movements, or voice sounding slightly different? Blame it on a bad connection. By speaking face-to-face this adds a layer of authenticity that supports our natural instinct to think that 'seeing is believing'.\nVoice cloning technology means attackers can speak in any voice too, carrying out voice phishing, also known as vishing, attacks. The growing capability of this technology is reflected in\nOpen AI's recommendation\nfor banks to start 'Phasing out voice based authentication as a security measure for accessing bank accounts and other sensitive information.'\nText-based communication is also transformed with GenAI. The rise of LLMs allows malicious actors to operate at near-native speaker level, with outputs able to be trained on regional dialects for even greater fluency. This opens the door to new markets for social engineering attacks, with language no longer a blocker when selecting targets.\nBringing order to unstructured OSINT with GenAI\nIf someone's ever been online, they'll have left a digital footprint somewhere. Depending on what they share, this can sometimes be enough to reveal enough information to impersonate them or compromise their identity. They may share their birthday on Facebook, post their place of employment on LinkedIn, and put pictures of their home, family, and life on Instagram.\nThese actions offer ways to build up profiles to use with social engineering attacks on the individuals and organizations they're connected to. In the past, gathering all this information would be a long and manual process. Searching each social media channel, trying to join the dots between people's posts and public information.\nNow, AI can do all this at hyperspeed, scouring the internet for unstructured data, to retrieve, organize and classify all possible matches. This includes facial recognition systems, where it's possible to upload a photo of someone and let the search engine find all the places they appear online.\nWhat's more, because the information is available publicly, it's possible to access and aggregate this information anonymously. Even when using paid-for GenAI tools, stolen accounts are for sale on the dark web, giving attackers another way to hide their activity, usage, and queries.\nTurning troves of data into troves of treasure\nLarge-scale data leaks are a fact of modern digital life, from over 533 million Facebook users having details (including birthdays, phone numbers, locations) compromised in 2021, to more than 3 billion Yahoo users having sensitive information exposed in 2024. Of course, manually sifting through these volumes of data troves isn't practical or possible.\nInstead, people can now harness GenAI tools to autonomously sort through high volumes of content. These can find any data that could be used maliciously, such as for extortion, weaponizing private discussions, or stealing Intellectual Property hidden in documents.\nThe AI also maps the creators of the documents (using a form of Named Entity Recognition), to establish any incriminating connections between different parties including wire transfers and confidential discussions.\nMany tools are open source, allowing users to customize with plugins and modules. For example, Recon-ng can be configured for use cases such as email harvesting and OSINT gathering. Other tools aren't for public use, such as Red Reaper. This is a form of Espionage AI, capable of sifting through hundreds of thousands of emails to detect sensitive information that could be used against organizations.\nThe GenAI genie is out of the bottle – is your business exposed?\nAttackers can now use the internet as a database. They just need a piece of data as a starting point, such as a name, email address, or image. GenAI can get to work, running real-time queries to mine, uncover, and process connections and relationships.\nThen it's about choosing the appropriate tool for exploits, often at scale and running autonomously. Whether that's deepfake videos and voice cloning, or LLM-based conversation-driven attacks. These would have been limited to a select group of specialists with the necessary knowledge. Now, the landscape is democratized with the rise of 'hacking as a service' that does much of the hard work for cybercriminals.\nSo how can you know what potentially compromising information is available about your organization?\nWe've built a\nthreat monitoring\ntool that tells you. It crawls every corner of the internet, letting you know what data is out there and could be exploited to build effective attack pretexts, so you can take action before an attacker gets to it first.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

Furthermore, the Microsoft Graph service is used to search through messages of the breached account.\n\"The threat actor was using keyword searching to view messages containing words such as username, password, admin, teamviewer, anydesk, credentials, secret, ministry, and gov,\" Redmond said, adding the emails matching these filter criteria were then exfiltrated to the threat actor.\nTo mitigate the risk posed by such attacks, organizations are recommended to\nblock device code flow\nwherever possible, enable phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), and follow the principle of least privilege.\nFound this article interesting?

About five months later, an updated version of the locker was advertised on the illicit marketplace with capabilities to remotely encrypt data via SFTP protocol.\nIt comes in multiple variants that are capable of encrypting files on Windows, VMware ESXi, and SFTP servers. RansomHub has also been observed actively recruiting affiliates from LockBit and BlackCat groups as part of a partnership program, indicating an attempt to capitalize on the law enforcement actions targeting its rivals.\nIn the incident analyzed by the Singaporean cybersecurity company, the threat actor is said to have unsuccessfully attempted to exploit a critical flaw impacting Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS devices (\nCVE-2024-3400\n) using a publicly available proof-of-concept (PoC), before ultimately breaching the victim network by means of a brute-force attack against the VPN service.\n\"This brute force attempt was based on an enriched dictionary of over 5,000 usernames and passwords,\" the researchers said. \"The attacker eventually gained access through a default account frequently used in data backup solutions, and the perimeter was finally breached.\"\nThe initial access was then abused to carry out the ransomware attack, with both data encryption and exfiltration occurring within 24 hours of the compromise.\nParticularly, it involved the weaponization of two known security flaws in Active Directory (\nCVE-2021-42278\naka noPac) and the Netlogon protocol (\nCVE-2020-1472\naka\nZeroLogon\n) to seize control of the domain controller and conduct lateral movement across the network.\n\"The exploitation of the above-mentioned vulnerabilities enabled the attacker to gain full privileged access to the domain controller, which is the nerve center of a Microsoft Windows-based infrastructure,\" the researchers said.\n\"Following the completion of the exfiltration operations, the attacker prepared the environment for the final phase of the attack. The attacker operated to render all company data, saved on the various NAS, completely unreadable and inaccessible, as well as impermissible to restore, with the aim of forcing the victim to pay the ransom to get their data back.\"\nAnother notable aspect of the attack is the use of PCHunter to stop and bypass endpoint security solutions, as well as Filezilla for data exfiltration.\n\"The origins of the RansomHub group, its offensive operations, and its overlapping characteristics with other groups confirm the existence of a vivid cybercrime ecosystem,\" the researchers said.\n\"This environment thrives on the sharing, reusing, and rebranding of tools and source codes, fueling a robust underground market where high-profile victims, infamous groups, and substantial sums of money play central roles.\"\nThe development comes as the cybersecurity firm detailed the inner workings of a \"formidable RaaS operator\" known as\nLynx\n, shedding light on their affiliate workflow, their cross-platform ransomware arsenal for Windows, Linux, and ESXi environments, and customizable encryption modes.\nAn analysis of the ransomware's Windows and Linux versions shows that it closely resembles INC ransomware, indicating that the threat actors likely acquired the latter's source code.\n\"Affiliates are incentivized with an 80% share of ransom proceeds, reflecting a competitive, recruitment-driven strategy,\" it\nsaid\n. \"Lynx recently added multiple encryption modes: 'fast,' 'medium,' 'slow,' and 'entire,' giving affiliates the freedom to adjust the trade-off between speed and depth of file encryption.\"\n\"The group's recruitment posts on underground forums emphasize a stringent verification process for pentesters and skilled intrusion teams, highlighting Lynx's emphasis on operational security and quality control. They also offer 'call centers' for harassing victims and advanced storage solutions for affiliates who consistently deliver profitable results.\"\nIn recent weeks, financially motivated attacks have also been observed using the\nPhorpiex\n(aka Trik) botnet malware propagated via phishing emails to deliver the\nLockBit\nransomware.\n\"Unlike the past LockBit ransomware incidents, the threat actors relied on Phorpiex to deliver and execute LockBit ransomware,\" Cybereason\nnoted\nin an analysis. \"This technique is unique as ransomware deployment usually consists of human operators conducting the attack.\"\nAnother significant initial infection vector concerns the exploitation of unpatched VPN appliances (e.g., CVE-2021-20038) to gain access to internal network devices and hosts and ultimately deploy\nAbyss Locker\nransomware.\nThe attacks are also characterized by the use of tunneling tools to maintain persistence, as well as leveraging Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (\nBYOVD\n) techniques to disable endpoint protection controls.\n\"After gaining access into the environment and performing reconnaissance, these tunneling tools are strategically deployed on critical network devices, including ESXi hosts, Windows hosts, VPN appliances, and network attached storage (NAS) devices,\" Sygnia researchers\nsaid\n.\n\"By targeting these devices, the attackers ensure robust and reliable communication channels to maintain access and orchestrate their malicious activities across the compromised network.\"\nThe ransomware landscape – led by\nthreat actors new and old\n– continues to remain in a state of flux, with attacks pivoting from traditional encryption to data theft and extortion, even as victims increasingly refuse to pay up, leading to a\ndecline in payments\nin 2024.\n\"Groups like RansomHub and Akira now incentivize stolen data with big rewards, making these tactics quite lucrative,\" cybersecurity firm Huntress\nsaid\n.\nFound this article interesting?

The distribution service is sending notices to potentially impacted users, advising them to reinstall Windows out of an abundance of caution.\nMalware on Steam\nPirateFi was\nreleased on Steam last week\nby Seaworth Interactive, and received positive reviews. It is described as a survival game set in a low-poly world involving base building, weapon crafting and food gathering.\nThe PirateFi Steam page\nSource: Internet Archive\nEarlier this week though, Steam discovered that the game contained malware but the service did not specify the exact type.\n\"The Steam account of the developer for this game uploaded builds to Steam that contained suspected malware,\" reads the\nnotification\n.\n\"You played PirateFi (3476470) on Steam while these builds were active, so it is likely that these malicious files launched on your computer,\" the service warns.\nThe recommended measures for the notification recipients include running a full system scan using an up-to-date antivirus, checking for newly installed software they don't recognize, and considering an OS format.\nSteam's notification to impacted users\nSource: SteamDB\nImpacted users have also\nposted warnings\non the title's Steam Community page, telling others not to launch the game as their antivirus recognized it as malware.\nMarius Genheimer of SECUINFRA Falcon Team obtained a sample of the malware distributed through PirateFi and identified it as a version of the Vidar infostealer.\n\"If you are one of the players who downloaded this \"game\": Consider the credentials, session cookies and secrets saved in your browser, email client, cryptocurrency wallets etc. compromised,\"\nadvises\nSECUINFRA.\nThe recommendation is to change the passwords for all potentially affected accounts and activate the multi-factor authentication protection where possible.\nThe malware, identified as Vidar based on dynamic analysis and YARA signature matches, was hidden in a file called Pirate.exe as a payload (\nHoward.exe\n) packed with InnoSetup installer.\nGenheimer told BleepingComputer that the threat actor modified the game files several times, using various obfuscation techniques and changing the command-and-control servers for credential exfiltration.\nThe researcher believes that the web3/blockchain/cryptocurrency references in the PirateFi name were intentional, to lure a specific player base\nSteam did not publish figures on how many users have been impacted by the PirateFi malware but statistics on the title's page shows that up to 1,500 individuals may be impacted.\nMalware infiltrating the Steam store is not common, but it's not unprecedented either. In February 2023, Steam users were targeted by\nmalicious Dota 2 game modes\nthat leveraged a Chrome n-day exploit to perform remote code execution on the players' computers.\nIn December 2023, a mod for the then-popular Slay the Spire indie strategy game was compromised by hackers who injected an\n'Epsilon' infostealer dropper\ninto it.\nSteam has introduced additional measures like\nSMS-based verification\nto protect players from unauthorized malicious updates, but the case of PirateFi shows that these measures are insufficient.\nRelated Articles:\nStolen Path of Exile 2 admin account used to hack player accounts\nDPRK hackers dupe targets into typing PowerShell commands as admin\nMicrosoft issues optional fix for Secure Boot zero-day used by malware\nCrypto-stealing apps found in Apple App Store for the first time\nMicrosoft says attackers use exposed ASP.NET keys to deploy malware"

The cybersecurity agency also ordered federal agencies\nto patch their systems against CVE-2024-12686\non January 13.\nPostgreSQL zero-day linked to BeyondTrust breach\nWhile analyzing CVE-2024-12356, the Rapid7 team\nuncovered a new zero-day vulnerability\nin PostgreSQL (\nCVE-2025-1094),\nwhich was reported on January 27 and patched on Thursday. CVE-2025-1094 allows SQL injections when the PostgreSQL interactive tool reads untrusted input, as it incorrectly processes specific invalid byte sequences from invalid UTF-8 characters.\n\"Improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL libpq functions PQescapeLiteral(), PQescapeIdentifier(), PQescapeString(), and PQescapeStringConn() allows a database input provider to achieve SQL injection in certain usage patterns,\" the PostgreSQL security team\nexplains\n.\n\"Specifically, SQL injection requires the application to use the function result to construct input to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal. Similarly, improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL command line utility programs allows a source of command line arguments to achieve SQL injection when client_encoding is BIG5 and server_encoding is one of EUC_TW or MULE_INTERNAL.\"\nRapid7's tests showed that successfully exploiting CVE-2024-12356 to achieve remote code execution requires using CVE-2025-1094, suggesting that the exploit associated with BeyondTrust RS CVE-2024-12356 relied on the exploitation of PostgreSQL CVE-2025-1094.\nAdditionally, while BeyondTrust said CVE-2024-12356 is a command injection vulnerability (CWE-77), Rapid7 argues that it would be more accurately classified as an argument injection vulnerability (CWE-88).\nRapid7 security researchers have also identified a method to exploit CVE-2025-1094 for remote code execution in vulnerable BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) systems independently of the CVE-2024-12356 argument injection vulnerability.\nMore importantly, they've found that while BeyondTrust's patch for CVE-2024-12356 does not address CVE-2025-1094's root cause, it successfully prevents the exploitation of both vulnerabilities.\n\"We have also learnt that it is possible to exploit CVE-2025-1094 in BeyondTrust Remote Support without the need to leverage CVE-2024-12356,\"\nRapid7 said\n. \"However, due to some additional input sanitation that the patch for CVE-2024-12356 employs, exploitation will still fail.\"\nRelated Articles:\nUK domain registry Nominet confirms breach via Ivanti zero-day\nUnpatched critical flaws impact Fancy Product Designer WordPress plugin\nFortinet discloses second firewall auth bypass patched in January\nMicrosoft February 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes 4 zero-days, 55 flaws\nMicrosoft issues optional fix for Secure Boot zero-day used by malware"

Qualifications are a given, but more importantly, a security team needs leadership \"empowered in the right ways with empathy and effective communication and a bias toward building relationships that are based on trust.\"\nYavor, along with Kim Burton and Jessica Walters, launched Credible Security at the start of 2025. The company works with business-to-business companies that offer cloud services and software-as-a-service, with a specific focus on underserved teams within organizations. That includes go-to-market teams that have public-facing functions and early-stage companies that are finding their security footing while still forming a growth strategy.\nThe founding partners — \"We haven't really fought over those titles yet,\" Yavor jokes — had worked together before at Tessian, Cisco, and Duo Security. When Proofpoint acquired Tessian in 2023, Yavor was CISO, Burton was head of trust and compliance, and Waters was senior security manager. They each had extensive security experience but had taken different paths to get there.\nPrior to holding security leadership roles at Cisco Secure, Duo Security, and Facebook, Yavor was a school teacher and owned an IT consulting business. Burton studied literature and classical languages in graduate school. Walters was chief of staff of Cisco's Security Business Group team. All three say their experiences at Duo Security demonstrated the value of bringing together practitioners from different backgrounds. They stayed at Duo through its Cisco acquisition in 2018 and landed in the same team at Cisco. When Yavor joined Tessian in 2021, Burton and Walters \"came over to continue the journey.\"\nThe team members' varied backgrounds \"make it so that when you encounter something that you haven't seen before, everyone is able to actually relate to something that they have, in fact, experienced,\" Burton says. \"When you have a team of people who've come from the same programs, the same location, the same ideas all the time, you actually end up with groupthink. We do not have that problem.\"\nHaving different perspectives is particularly important when helping customers develop and execute their cloud strategies, according to the trio. Cloud services touch every aspect of people's lives, so B2B enterprises need to prioritize building trust with end users as part of their strategy. In the past 10 to 15 years, enterprises have made strides in thinking about risk and how to manage it, but they haven't mastered the strategy in all areas, Yavor says.\nThe missing part that Credible Security targets \"is having consistent strategy and outcomes in evaluating and delivering trust on both sides of the equation [end users and service providers],\" Yavor says. Trust is critical at every juncture of that pipeline; with some proactive security thinking and investment, businesses can boost results.\n\"We are helping our clients simplify their strategies and align them to their actual business objectives so that they have a much easier and more efficient approach to developing not just minimum viable security for whatever their product is, but actually using it as a competitive advantage as they try to earn their customers' trust and then maintain it through a long-term relationship,\" Yavor says.\nWhen managing risk, many companies still conflate trust with compliance, \"where you're doing checkbox exercises because you have to show up to an auditor and tell them about it. But that's a backward way of thinking about it,\" Burton says. Compliance is only a way to verify trustworthiness, and trust develops as consultants show that they are working with the same values and goals in mind.\n\"It's saying: 'Hey, how can you actually design your product and your process so that the customers that you are finding actually understand this deep-felt sense that they know you will do the best by them?'\"\nAnother advantage Credible Security offers is the ability to tap the team's experience as both buyers of security products and on the developer side of the process.\n\"All three of us have these layered experiences of both things we've done or built, but then also seeing teams and brands that really showed up in a way that we would want family members to experience,\" Walters says. The variety of positions they have held — CISO, head of compliance, chief of staff — also give them internal perspective, Yavor adds.\n\"That's actually one of the most exciting differentiators about our company, that all three of us, we haven't just been in the industry, we have been in the roles that we are seeking to help,\" he says. \"We've actually done the work.\"\nRead more about:\nMercedes Cardona\nContributing Writer, Dark Reading\nMercedes Cardona is a New York-based business journalist.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nBanking fraud and financial crimes are growing more sophisticated every day. By understanding the threats and building strong collaborations, banks can protect themselves and their clients.\nFebruary 14, 2025\nCOMMENTARY\nBanking executives have a lot to consider when it comes to financial crime. With new technologies at their disposal, fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated, underscoring the importance of staying vigilant in protecting against these emerging threats. In the near future, synthetic identity fraud and account takeovers will increasingly be leveraged to maximize gains, and AI and machine learning will rapidly adapt to a bank's detection methods. While most banks recognize the importance of fraud prevention, having a clear strategy and best practices is essential to mitigate the rising risks posed by these evolving technologies.\nLast year, US fraud losses totaled a staggering $12.3 billion, and the emergence of new technologies will amplify financial crimes further. Research from Deloitte expects US fraud losses to grow to $40 billion by 2027, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32%. Generative AI is one reason why bank fraud is growing. At Grasshopper, we've seen fraudsters try to use generative AI (GenAI) to create fake business profiles and descriptions when applying for small business loans. To combat this, banks need to implement advanced AI-driven fraud monitoring and detection tools, enhance identity verification processes, and stay vigilant with continuous monitoring and staff training to recognize anomalies.\nThe rise of banking-as-a-service (BaaS) and embedded banking has also created more opportunities for bad actors to try to exploit gaps in fraud prevention. In this model, banks lose the direct connection with the end user, adding complexity to fraud prevention efforts. BaaS and embedded finance solutions offer significant advantages for modern banking, but they also present new challenges in fraud prevention. PYMNTS.com reports that bad actors are targeting application programming interfaces (APIs) — serving as the bridge between banks and their BaaS partners — are being viewed by bad actors as entry points. Earlier this year, attacks on APIs were up 20% year over year. Although the benefits of BaaS far outweigh the risks, fraud activity continues to accelerate. To stay protected, banks and their BaaS partners need a systemic approach to manage risk tolerance across the platform and protect themselves and their clients. \nBanks and BaaS partners who collaborate closely to continuously improve their risk programs can navigate the evolving risks and rewards of AI. The most successful way to be effective and successful in preventing fraud is to have a shared understanding of the risk appetite and compliance program. Sometimes, this will mean the bank has to say no to a potential BaaS partnership, if the partner doesn't align with the bank's risk culture. This can be as simple as one partner shifting focus to a specific industry that the other is not as committed to serving. If one partner is choosing to pivot in a specific direction and the other is not, the partnership is no longer aligned. A shared understanding should be established at the onset of the relationship, but partners should also routinely check in to ensure they remain aligned, as risk appetite is always evolving alongside growth.\nThe partnership should also clearly identify roles and responsibilities to create clarity and transparency in the fraud prevention strategy. The professionals engaged in the relationship should know how responsibilities are allocated to create a solid foundation of the risk framework. From there, teams should share resources through joint training programs and guides for new regulation or threat activity. Ultimately, a robust program doesn't just identify gaps — it actively closes them. Through regular audits and swift, actionable responses, it ensures vulnerabilities are eliminated, keeping fraud prevention strong and resilient. By embracing these strategies, banks can confidently drive the innovation economy forward, unlocking the full potential of BaaS partnerships while safeguarding against financial crime.\nTechnology is a critical component of a successful fraud prevention program, but it can't stand alone. The fact is, humans have an innate ability to detect when something doesn't feel right — robotic behavior, no matter how sophisticated, still raises red flags for human analysts. Outliers that slip past automated systems are often identified by skilled anti-fraud professionals who can spot the subtle signs that machines miss. \nBanking fraud and financial crimes are growing more sophisticated every day, and the banking industry continues to evolve by forging relationships with new partners. While these partnerships can introduce new fraud risks, banks don't have to be vulnerable. By understanding the threats, building strong collaborations, and investing in advanced detection tools, banks can stay one step ahead and protect themselves and their clients. \nAlena Robertson\nBSA Manager, Grasshopper Bank\nAlena Robertson is a seasoned financial crime governance leader with more than a decade of experience in BSA/AML compliance and fraud prevention within financial institutions.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nCompanies pursing internal AI development using models from Hugging Face and other open source repositories need to focus on supply chain security and checking for vulnerabilities.\nFebruary 14, 2025\nAttackers are finding more and more ways to post malicious projects to Hugging Face and other repositories for open source artificial intelligence (AI) models, while dodging the sites' security checks. The escalating problem underscores the need for companies pursuing internal AI projects to have robust mechanisms to detect security flaws and malicious code within their supply chains.\nHugging Face's automated checks, for example, recently failed to detect malicious code in two AI models hosted on the repository, according to a Feb. 3 analysis published by software supply chain security firm ReversingLabs. The threat actor used a common vector — data files using the Pickle format — with a new technique, dubbed \"NullifAI,\" to evade detection.\nWhile the attacks appeared to be proofs-of-concept, their success in being hosted with a \"No issue\" tag shows that companies should not rely on Hugging Face's and other repositories' safety checks for their own security, says Tomislav Pericin, chief software architect at ReversingLabs.\n\"You have this public repository where any developer or machine learning expert can host their own stuff, and obviously malicious actors abuse that,\" he says. \"Depending on the ecosystem, the vector is going to be slightly different, but the idea is the same: Someone's going to host a malicious version of a thing and hope for you to inadvertently install it.\"\nRelated:This Security Firm's 'Bias' Is Also Its Superpower\nCompanies are quickly adopting AI, and the majority are also establishing internal projects using open source AI models from repositories — such as Hugging Face, TensorFlow Hub, and PyTorch Hub. Overall, 61% of companies are using models from the open source ecosystem to create their own AI tools, according to a Morning Consult survey of 2,400 IT decision-makers sponsored by IBM.\nYet many of the components can contain executable code, leading to a variety of security risks, such as code execution, backdoors, prompt injections, and alignment issues — the latter being how well an AI model matches the intent of the developers and users.\nOne significant issue is that a commonly used data format, known as a Pickle file, is not secure and can be used to execute arbitrary code. Despite vocal warnings from security researchers, the Pickle format continues to be used by many data scientists, says Tom Bonner, vice president of research at HiddenLayer, an AI-focused detection and response firm.\n\"I really hoped that we'd make enough noise about it that Pickle would've gone by now, but it's not,\" he says. \"I've seen organizations compromised through machine learning models — multiple [organizations] at this point. So yeah, whilst it's not an everyday occurrence such as ransomware or phishing campaigns, it does happen.\"\nRelated:How Banks Can Adapt to the Rising Threat of Financial Crime\nWhile Hugging Face has explicit checks for Pickle files, the malicious code discovered by ReversingLabs sidestepped those checks by using a different file compression for the data. Other research by application security firm Checkmarx found multiple ways to bypass the scanners, such as PickleScan used by Hugging Face, to detect dangerous Pickle files.\n\nDespite having malicious features, this model passes security checks on Hugging Face. Source: ReversingLabs\n\"PickleScan uses a blocklist which was successfully bypassed using both built-in Python dependencies,\" Dor Tumarkin, director of application security research at Checkmarx, stated in the analysis. \"It is plainly vulnerable, but by using third-party dependencies such as Pandas to bypass it, even if it were to consider all cases baked into Python, it would still be vulnerable with very popular imports in its scope.\"\nRather than Pickle files, data science and AI teams should move to Safetensors — a library for a new data format managed by Hugging Face, EleutherAI, and Stability AI — which has been audited for security. The Safetensors format is considered much safer than the Pickle format.\nRelated:Warning: Tunnel of Love Leads to Scams\nExecutable data files are not the only threats, however. Licensing is another issue: While pretrained AI models are frequently called \"open source AI,\" they generally do not provide all the information needed to reproduce the AI model, such as code and training data. Instead, they provide the weights generated by the training and are covered by licenses that are not always open source compatible.\nCreating commercial products or services from such models can potentially result in violating the licenses, says Andrew Stiefel, a senior product manager at Endor Labs.\n\"There's a lot of complexity in the licenses for models,\" he says. \"You have the actual model binary itself, the weights, the training data, all of those could have different licenses, and you need to understand what that means for your business.\"\nModel alignment — how well its output aligns with the developers' and users' values — is the final wildcard. DeepSeek, for example, allows users to create malware and viruses, researchers found. Other models — such as OpenAI's o3-mini model, which boasts more stringent alignment — has already been jail broken by researchers.\nThese problems are unique to AI systems and the boundaries of how to test for such weaknesses remains a fertile field for researchers, says ReversingLabs' Pericin.\n\"There is already research about what kind of prompts would trigger the model to behave in an unpredictable way, divulge confidential information, or teach things that could be harmful,\" he says. \"That's a whole other discipline of machine learning model safety that people are, in all honesty, mostly worried about today.\"\nCompanies should make sure to understand any licenses covering the AI models they are using. In addition, they should pay attention to common signals of software safety, including the source of the model, development activity around the model, its popularity, and the operational and security risks, Endor's Stiefel says.\n\"You kind of need to manage AI models like you would any other open source dependencies,\" Stiefel says. \"They're built by people outside of your organization and you're bringing them in, and so that means you need to take that same holistic approach to looking at risks.\"\nRobert Lemos, Contributing Writer\n\nVeteran technology journalist of more than 20 years.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nThe China-sponsored state espionage group has exploited known, older bugs in Cisco gear for successful cyber intrusions on six continents in the past two months.\nFebruary 14, 2025\nThe Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Salt Typhoon has targeted more than a thousand Cisco devices located within the infrastructures of telecommunications companies, internet service providers (ISPs), and universities.\nSalt Typhoon (aka RedMike, Earth Estries, FamousSparrow, GhostEmperor, and UNC2286) first made its name last fall, with explosive reports about its targeting major US telecommunications providers like T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. In the process, it managed to eavesdrop on US law enforcement wiretaps, and even the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns.\nApparently, all that new media attention did little to slow it down. According to Recorded Future's Insikt Group, Salt Typhoon — which Insikt tracks as \"RedMike\" — attacked communications providers and research universities worldwide on six occasions in December and January. The group exploited old bugs in Cisco network devices to infiltrate its targets, and this may not actually be the first time it tried this tactic.\nIn a statement to Dark Reading, a Cisco spokesperson wrote that \"We are aware of new reports that claim Salt Typhoon threat actors are exploiting two known vulnerabilities in Cisco devices relating to IOS XE. To date, we have not been able to validate these claims but continue to review available data.\" They added that \"In 2023, we issued a security advisory disclosing these vulnerabilities along with guidance for customers to urgently apply the available software fix. We strongly advise customers to patch known vulnerabilities that have been disclosed and follow industry best practices for securing management protocols.\"\nRelated:Chinese APT 'Emperor Dragonfly' Moonlights With Ransomware\nBack in October 2023, Cisco urged all of its customers to immediately pull all their routers, switches, etc., off the Web — at least those running the IOS XE operating system. An attacker had been actively exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in the user interface (UI) which, without prior authorization, allowed them to create new local accounts with administrative privileges. The issue was assigned CVE-2023-20198, with the highest possible score of 10 out of 10 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).\nJust a few days later, Cisco revealed a second IOS XE web UI vulnerability that was being exploited in tandem with CVE-2023-20198. CVE-2023-20273 took the first vulnerability a step further, allowing attackers to run malicious commands on compromised devices using root privileges. It earned a \"high\" 7.2 CVSS score.\nRelated:Salt Typhoon's Impact on the US & Beyond\nEvidently, Cisco's warnings were not heard loudly and widely enough, as Salt Typhoon followed this exact path to just recently compromise large organizations on six continents. With the complete power afforded by CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273, the threat actor would then configure Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels connecting compromised devices with its own infrastructure. It used this otherwise legitimate feature to establish persistence and enable data exfiltration, with less risk of detection by firewalls or network monitoring software.\nThough Insikt tracks this campaign only back through December, it's possible that this isn't the first time Salt Typhoon has used Cisco devices to target major telcos.\n\"Very little detail is currently publicly available about the Salt Typhoon-linked intrusions against US telecommunications providers uncovered in September 2024, including whether or not Cisco devices were involved,\" explains Jon Condra, senior director of strategic intelligence at Recorded Future. \"Notably, CISA in December 2024 put out defensive guidance for communications providers that implies that Cisco devices have been exploited, linked to the Salt Typhoon intrusions, without providing specifics. We do know that Cisco devices have been targeted by Chinese APT groups on many occasions in the past, as with a variety of other edge devices.\"\nRelated:Magecart Attackers Abuse Google Ad Tool to Steal Data\nOrganizations affected by this campaign include a US affiliate of a UK telco, a US telco and ISP, an Italian ISP, a South African telco, a Thai telco, and Mytel, one of Myanmar's premier telcos.\n\"Salt Typhoon targets telecommunications systems which are some of the most complicated Frankenstein-esque examples of architectures that exist,\" explains Zach Edwards, senior threat researcher for Silent Push. That even old vulnerabilities might still be exploited against telcos, he suggests, isn't such a mystery: \"They possess some technologies in certain systems dating back decades that, in many cases, cannot be replaced, and with other modernized aspects that remain vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.\"\nAnd besides telcos and ISPs themselves, Salt Typhoon also attacked 13 universities, including the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and three more US institutions, plus more in Argentina, Indonesia, the Netherlands, etc. As Insikt noted, many of these universities perform significant research in telecommunications, engineering, and other areas of technology.\nOverall, while more than 100 countries have been touched by this campaign, more than half of the devices compromised have been in South America, India, and, most often, the US.\nRecorded Future's Condra emphasizes that while prior Salt Typhoon coverage has been US-centric, he says, \"The group’s targeting extends far beyond US borders and is truly global in scope. This speaks to strategic Chinese intelligence requirements to gain access to sensitive networks for the purposes of espionage, gaining the ability to disrupt or manipulate data flows, or pre-position themselves for disruptive or destructive action in the event of an escalation of geopolitical tensions or kinetic conflict.\"\nNate Nelson, Contributing Writer\n\nNate Nelson is a writer based in New York City.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nRomance-baiting losses were up 40% last year, as more and more pig-butchering efforts crop up in the wild.\nFebruary 14, 2025\nNEWS BRIEF\nIn what appears to be the more sinister side of romance, the amount of money individuals lost in 2024 to love-baiting scams, known to some as pig butchering, increased 40%.\nThat's according to ChainAnalysis, which said the scams, in which fraudsters approach their victims on dating apps or sites, groom them, and convince them to give them money or invest in a supposed \"business venture,\" are growing in number, too. The number of people losing money this way increased by 210% year-over-year in 2024, probably because more scams are circulating. The operations are increasingly run out of compounds in Southeast Asia with staffers who are being held against their will.\nOne piece of good news though: The average loss per person declined 55% year-over-year.\n\"The combination of lower payment amounts and increased deposits could indicate a change in strategy for pig-butchering scams,\" said the researchers. \"Scammers could be spending less time priming targets, and therefore, receiving smaller payments in exchange for targeting more victims.\"\nOverall, with romance baiting comprising a third of total crypto fraud revenue in 2024, signs — or cupid arrows — point to romance scams becoming even bigger this coming year. Users of dating apps should be wary of connections made online, and should avoid sending money, cryptocurrency, wire transfers, or prepaid gift cards to anyone they don't know personally.\nRead more about:\nKristina Beek, Associate Editor, Dark Reading\n\nSkilled writer and editor covering cybersecurity for Dark Reading.\nYou May Also Like\nSecuring the Remote Workforce\nEmerging Technologies and Their Impact on CISO Strategies\nHow CISOs Navigate the Regulatory and Compliance Maze\nWhere Does Outsourcing Make Sense for Your Organization?\nShift Left: Integrating Security into the Software Development Lifecycle\n[Conference] Black Hat USA - August 2-7 - Learn More\n[Conference] Black Hat Asia - April 1-4 - Learn More\n[Dark Reading Virtual Event] Cybersecurity's Most Promising New and Emerging Technologies\nThe State of Firewall Security: Challenges, Risks, and Solutions for Modern Networks\nIndustrial Networks in the Age of Digitalization\nZero-Trust Adoption Driven by Data Protection, Cloud Access Control, and Regulatory Compliance Requirements\nThreat Hunting's Evolution: From On-Premises to the Cloud\nHow Enterprises Secure Their Applications\nSecuring the Remote Workforce\nEmerging Technologies and Their Impact on CISO Strategies\nHow CISOs Navigate the Regulatory and Compliance Maze\nWhere Does Outsourcing Make Sense for Your Organization?\nShift Left: Integrating Security into the Software Development Lifecycle\nTop 10 CI/CD Security Risks: The Technical Guide\nFrost Radar: Cloud Security Posture Management, 2024\nThe State of Cloud Native Security Report 2024\nThe State of Firewall Security: Challenges, Risks, and Solutions for Modern Networks\nUnderstanding Social Engineering Attacks and What To Do About Them\n[Conference] Black Hat USA - August 2-7 - Learn More\n[Conference] Black Hat Asia - April 1-4 - Learn More\n[Dark Reading Virtual Event] Cybersecurity's Most Promising New and Emerging Technologies\nCopyright © 2025.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nIn the latest edition of “Rising Tides” we talk with Lesley Carhart, Technical Director of Incident Response at Dragos.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nRising Tides – A conversation with Lesley Carhart, Technical Director of Incident Response at Dragos\nOne of the greatest realities of our current timeline is division. Division over geopolitical dynamics, division over human and civil rights, division over how to address complex security issues—and so much more. In the latest edition of “Rising Tides” I spoke with Lesley Carhart, Technical Director of Incident Response, Dragos about all three of these topics, as well as the importance of mentorship and an almost call-to-action for other senior leaders to step up into more formal and organized mentorship roles.\n\n\n\nLesley’s takes are hot but also realistic and attainable. For example, if we can come together to bridge the critical complexities that often put enterprise security and operational technology (OT) at odds, something Lesley is extremely passionate about, we can accelerate security progress.\n\n\n\nAs a very open nonbinary and trans person, Lesley says, that while our cybersecurity industry is “much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce,” there is still sometimes threatening levels of backlash, especially for the queer community.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, we had to touch on the potential need for increased cybersecurity diligence overall with the new U.S. presidential administration, especially from an industrial controls systems perspective, and their overall “magic genie” wish for more critical thinking skills about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling.\n\n\n\nRead the interview for more on all of this, as well as why people are drawn to authenticity more than anything, and where to find them on the social web.\n\n\n\nLesley Carhart, Technical Director of Incident Response at Dragos \nQ. You’ve been a strong voice in our industry for some time. Please tell me how your career evolved from the military and throughout your time at Dragos, and the role you play there now.\nA. I’ve always cared deeply about two things – making the world better than I came into it, and understanding how the world works. I had a rather stereotypical path into cybersecurity (as a person who started programming at a very young age), but I’ve always tended towards the circuits and wires of computers and networks that make the world go, not code or abstract concepts. I did this as an aircraft electronics technician in the Air Force, as a network engineering major, and eventually as a cybersecurity person focusing on industrial technology.\n\n\n\nQ. Our industry is quite transient and a lot of people don’t stick to one place for long, yet you’ve been with Dragos for seven years. What is it that drives you to stay?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nA.  A few reasons – first of all, I have zero ethical quandary about what I wake up and do at Dragos every day. I don’t even have to personally adore every single industrial company – it is sufficient that I know that if there is damage to their industrial devices people or the environment may be harmed, and the right thing to do is to protect and restore that infrastructure.Secondly, I love the work, and it’s still pretty niche. There are very few firms doing serious industrial incident response (especially for the caseload we have!) and even fewer that get their hands in every vertical, globally. Dragos is a place where I can make a difference, and I’m challenged by some of the best practitioners in the field.\n\n\n\nQ. What was the transition like from public sector to private sector vendor cybersecurity?\nA. Oh, I have worked in every type and size of organization, public and private over the years. I mentor a lot of young people and I have frequent conversations about the upsides and downsides of choosing government versus a startup, versus a corporation, and so forth. You can do really interesting work and training with the government, and there’s a lot of career and work-life stability in that type of role. However, in startups and small companies you can have a lot faster and more substantial impact on the direction an organization goes in. You can also be less siloed, and make more immediate cash. There are always trade offs. I encourage every young cybersecurity person to explore all of those options.\n\n\n\nQ. I know you’ve been asked this one million times at least, but many people know you as “hacks4pancakes.” I would personally do most anything for a pancake – is there a broader story to this name or do you simply love pancakes?\nA. It’s self-deprecating humor. It’s like “moves for pizzas”. I do a lot of volunteer work in the community. I get paid in food a lot. Don’t ask me for advice on getting rich. At least not rich in money.\n\n\n\nQ. When we talked about doing this interview, you said that repairing relationships between cybersecurity and operational teams is critical, and nontrivial. How do you personally approach this gap and why are you especially passionate about it?\nA. The unfortunate reality of OT cybersecurity today is that enterprise cybersecurity as a practice has soured relationships over a decade through lack of understanding of needs, process safety, and realities of cybersecurity capabilities in process environments. Audits and demands to immediately patch systems without consideration for human life and safety have absolutely caused relationship damage, and there’s now a dangerous level of shadow IT and poor communication between the teams in a lot of organizations. This bleeds into every capability, from architecture, to detection, to incident response, with huge implications. You can’t respond to an emergency if people refuse to speak to one another.\n\n\n\nI think this is really crucial to understand and address in every organization because it not only is essential to building a functional program, but it teaches enterprise cybersecurity people the profound difference in cybersecurity priorities and methods in OT. Start with shadowing and listening to your OT staff. Understand what really matters – real life consequences like process damage or injury. Start to understand the real restrictions and risk measures that limit modern security tooling. Then you can work on cybersecurity moving forward, together. Food helps! Bring doughnuts.\n\n\n\nQ. Whether a security issue or a non-nefarious technical issue, what have you seen as the biggest operational security risk that has been created in the last year? Do you also feel it was properly addressed, and if not, how could we have done better?\nA. Lack of basic realistic planning and testing of plans for incident response. A lot of organizations have some kind of IT incident response plan, or they’ve copied a template from the internet for audit purposes for OT, but the plan lacks adequate tailoring for the real OT environment and testing to assure it will actually work. When seconds count, these organizations are scrambling for days to find basic data on their network architecture or methods to restore OT device backups.\n\n\n\nIncidents are only getting worse and more common in OT as adversaries realize they’re often a soft target with visible real life impacts. Start somewhere. Make a plan for how you will respond to OT-specific incidents and test that plan in tabletops and drills to see if it actually works. It is not a copy-paste from Enterprise.\n\n\n\nQ: Cybersecurity threats in operational environments have been an important focus for some time, and there are concerns that come with the administration change the U.S. is going to have to up our diligence significantly to protect human survival that relies on operational tech. Do you agree with this hot take, or have another perspective entirely?\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ. The same statement applies when it comes to human rights and socioeconomic issues, especially those who fall into under-represented groups. If you agree, what do you think we can do as a cybersecurity industry or community to help? If not, what do you think is the better mindset to have?\nA. The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying. We spend a lot of time talking about electrical power cybersecurity (and it’s definitely a cornerstone of functional society and safety), but that’s partially because that’s the only thing most of us have ever seen fail. In the US, most of us have never seen sewage not work for days, or long-term water cutoffs to our homes. That’s something we are just not equipped for.For underprivileged communities, the gap in resources for cybersecurity in municipal utilities is often even more pronounced. A key part of the battle is informed citizens and legislators recognizing all the places industrial systems keep our modern society working, and considering the implications of them failing or being tampered with. There’s been a lot of good community and governmental work towards closing this gap, but we have a long way to go.\n\n\n\nQ. Early last year you did a talk called “We’re All Scared, Too: 10 Years of Lessons from Cybersecurity Mentorship” for Wild West Hackin’ Fest. What was your biggest takeaway for that audience on the importance of mentorship?\nA. I do a lot of career mentorship through clinics and office hours, and the thing that’s really struck me is how many people have the exact same problems, but no idea they aren’t totally alone in them. In my talk, I spoke about some things I see weekly, like difficulty in choosing a cybersecurity niche, problems with toxic workplaces, the pressure to move to management from a technical role, and even burnout. They need a stranger like me to tell them it’s normal and okay, and help them tackle those problems. Sadly, I’m usually booked out for months because of the massive demand for mentorship. We need more senior people stepping up and taking on formal and organized mentorship roles. People need an outside ear and unbiased perspective.\n\n\n\nQ. I found a tweet from more than two years ago from you that said: “Hi, just a gentle nudge that it is pride month, and I’m very genuinely non-binary / trans, and that is a meaningful thing to me – not a fad. I very much admire you all’s support of women, who I share many experiences with and support too, but code switching is exhausting.” Do you feel as if, at least within our industry, less “code switching” is necessary and there is more outward, dedicated support for non-binary and/or trans people?\nA. In my personal experience, cybersecurity is much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce. We have a robust community and good social support groups. That said, queer people today are facing the same cultural backlash in IT as anywhere else in society. I work in a customer-facing role. I’m active in the media and as a professional speaker. Sometimes I have to appear unremarkable and inoffensive to the audience to get the job done, and it sucks. I don’t know what the right answer is. I’ll continue to do everything I can to make everyone welcome in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this interview was conducted, Lesley announced a move to Melbourne, Australia, and will continue acting as Technical Director of Incident Response for Dragos.\nQ. Speaking of “former Twitter,” have you fully made the move to BlueSky like so many others? In other words, where can people best find you now?\nA. I left Twitter two years ago for ethical reasons and I have not looked back. I’m active on LinkedIn, Mastodon (Jerry Bell’s infosec.exchange instance), Bluesky, Threads, and Instagram. I also have a YouTube and a blog. A plethora of ways to find me and keep in touch, should the reader wish to. I love making new pals!\n\n\n\nQ.  We’ve covered a lot of topics so far, from your career to the state of the world to the issues affecting humans. What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly. We are prioritizing the wrong things, and jumping ahead of the basics. We aren’t thinking adequately as a society about the long-term results of our choices. In reality, the solution comes back to prioritizing better foundational education for the next generation, and continuing that education through life.\n\n\n\nQ.  On the lighter side, what is something you’ve seen in our industry over the last year that may or may not be serious, but made you laugh, that we can all learn from?\nA. I get a chuckle every time somebody (almost daily) tells me they can’t decide what job they want to do in cybersecurity. Without fail, they all think they’re the only hacker interested in everything. Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices. People at DEF CON only talk about their cool days. Learn about the other ninety percent of their careers and what they dislike about their jobs. Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable. The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nOne of the greatest realities of our current timeline is division. Division over geopolitical dynamics, division over human and civil rights, division over how to address complex security issues—and so much more. In the latest edition of “Rising Tides” I spoke with Lesley Carhart, Technical Director of Incident Response, Dragos about all three of these topics, as well as the importance of mentorship and an almost call-to-action for other senior leaders to step up into more formal and organized mentorship roles.\n\n\n\nLesley’s takes are hot but also realistic and attainable. For example, if we can come together to bridge the critical complexities that often put enterprise security and operational technology (OT) at odds, something Lesley is extremely passionate about, we can accelerate security progress.\n\n\n\nAs a very open nonbinary and trans person, Lesley says, that while our cybersecurity industry is “much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce,” there is still sometimes threatening levels of backlash, especially for the queer community.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, we had to touch on the potential need for increased cybersecurity diligence overall with the new U.S. presidential administration, especially from an industrial controls systems perspective, and their overall “magic genie” wish for more critical thinking skills about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling.\n\n\n\nRead the interview for more on all of this, as well as why people are drawn to authenticity more than anything, and where to find them on the social web.\n\n\n\nLesley Carhart, Technical Director of Incident Response at Dragos \nQ. You’ve been a strong voice in our industry for some time. Please tell me how your career evolved from the military and throughout your time at Dragos, and the role you play there now.\nA. I’ve always cared deeply about two things – making the world better than I came into it, and understanding how the world works. I had a rather stereotypical path into cybersecurity (as a person who started programming at a very young age), but I’ve always tended towards the circuits and wires of computers and networks that make the world go, not code or abstract concepts. I did this as an aircraft electronics technician in the Air Force, as a network engineering major, and eventually as a cybersecurity person focusing on industrial technology.\n\n\n\nQ. Our industry is quite transient and a lot of people don’t stick to one place for long, yet you’ve been with Dragos for seven years. What is it that drives you to stay?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nA.  A few reasons – first of all, I have zero ethical quandary about what I wake up and do at Dragos every day. I don’t even have to personally adore every single industrial company – it is sufficient that I know that if there is damage to their industrial devices people or the environment may be harmed, and the right thing to do is to protect and restore that infrastructure.Secondly, I love the work, and it’s still pretty niche. There are very few firms doing serious industrial incident response (especially for the caseload we have!) and even fewer that get their hands in every vertical, globally. Dragos is a place where I can make a difference, and I’m challenged by some of the best practitioners in the field.\n\n\n\nQ. What was the transition like from public sector to private sector vendor cybersecurity?\nA. Oh, I have worked in every type and size of organization, public and private over the years. I mentor a lot of young people and I have frequent conversations about the upsides and downsides of choosing government versus a startup, versus a corporation, and so forth. You can do really interesting work and training with the government, and there’s a lot of career and work-life stability in that type of role. However, in startups and small companies you can have a lot faster and more substantial impact on the direction an organization goes in. You can also be less siloed, and make more immediate cash. There are always trade offs. I encourage every young cybersecurity person to explore all of those options.\n\n\n\nQ. I know you’ve been asked this one million times at least, but many people know you as “hacks4pancakes.” I would personally do most anything for a pancake – is there a broader story to this name or do you simply love pancakes?\nA. It’s self-deprecating humor. It’s like “moves for pizzas”. I do a lot of volunteer work in the community. I get paid in food a lot. Don’t ask me for advice on getting rich. At least not rich in money.\n\n\n\nQ. When we talked about doing this interview, you said that repairing relationships between cybersecurity and operational teams is critical, and nontrivial. How do you personally approach this gap and why are you especially passionate about it?\nA. The unfortunate reality of OT cybersecurity today is that enterprise cybersecurity as a practice has soured relationships over a decade through lack of understanding of needs, process safety, and realities of cybersecurity capabilities in process environments. Audits and demands to immediately patch systems without consideration for human life and safety have absolutely caused relationship damage, and there’s now a dangerous level of shadow IT and poor communication between the teams in a lot of organizations. This bleeds into every capability, from architecture, to detection, to incident response, with huge implications. You can’t respond to an emergency if people refuse to speak to one another.\n\n\n\nI think this is really crucial to understand and address in every organization because it not only is essential to building a functional program, but it teaches enterprise cybersecurity people the profound difference in cybersecurity priorities and methods in OT. Start with shadowing and listening to your OT staff. Understand what really matters – real life consequences like process damage or injury. Start to understand the real restrictions and risk measures that limit modern security tooling. Then you can work on cybersecurity moving forward, together. Food helps! Bring doughnuts.\n\n\n\nQ. Whether a security issue or a non-nefarious technical issue, what have you seen as the biggest operational security risk that has been created in the last year? Do you also feel it was properly addressed, and if not, how could we have done better?\nA. Lack of basic realistic planning and testing of plans for incident response. A lot of organizations have some kind of IT incident response plan, or they’ve copied a template from the internet for audit purposes for OT, but the plan lacks adequate tailoring for the real OT environment and testing to assure it will actually work. When seconds count, these organizations are scrambling for days to find basic data on their network architecture or methods to restore OT device backups.\n\n\n\nIncidents are only getting worse and more common in OT as adversaries realize they’re often a soft target with visible real life impacts. Start somewhere. Make a plan for how you will respond to OT-specific incidents and test that plan in tabletops and drills to see if it actually works. It is not a copy-paste from Enterprise.\n\n\n\nQ: Cybersecurity threats in operational environments have been an important focus for some time, and there are concerns that come with the administration change the U.S. is going to have to up our diligence significantly to protect human survival that relies on operational tech. Do you agree with this hot take, or have another perspective entirely?\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ. The same statement applies when it comes to human rights and socioeconomic issues, especially those who fall into under-represented groups. If you agree, what do you think we can do as a cybersecurity industry or community to help? If not, what do you think is the better mindset to have?\nA. The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying. We spend a lot of time talking about electrical power cybersecurity (and it’s definitely a cornerstone of functional society and safety), but that’s partially because that’s the only thing most of us have ever seen fail. In the US, most of us have never seen sewage not work for days, or long-term water cutoffs to our homes. That’s something we are just not equipped for.For underprivileged communities, the gap in resources for cybersecurity in municipal utilities is often even more pronounced.

I found a tweet from more than two years ago from you that said: “Hi, just a gentle nudge that it is pride month, and I’m very genuinely non-binary / trans, and that is a meaningful thing to me – not a fad. I very much admire you all’s support of women, who I share many experiences with and support too, but code switching is exhausting.” Do you feel as if, at least within our industry, less “code switching” is necessary and there is more outward, dedicated support for non-binary and/or trans people?\nA. In my personal experience, cybersecurity is much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce. We have a robust community and good social support groups. That said, queer people today are facing the same cultural backlash in IT as anywhere else in society. I work in a customer-facing role. I’m active in the media and as a professional speaker. Sometimes I have to appear unremarkable and inoffensive to the audience to get the job done, and it sucks. I don’t know what the right answer is. I’ll continue to do everything I can to make everyone welcome in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this interview was conducted, Lesley announced a move to Melbourne, Australia, and will continue acting as Technical Director of Incident Response for Dragos.\nQ. Speaking of “former Twitter,” have you fully made the move to BlueSky like so many others? In other words, where can people best find you now?\nA. I left Twitter two years ago for ethical reasons and I have not looked back. I’m active on LinkedIn, Mastodon (Jerry Bell’s infosec.exchange instance), Bluesky, Threads, and Instagram. I also have a YouTube and a blog. A plethora of ways to find me and keep in touch, should the reader wish to. I love making new pals!\n\n\n\nQ.  We’ve covered a lot of topics so far, from your career to the state of the world to the issues affecting humans. What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly. We are prioritizing the wrong things, and jumping ahead of the basics. We aren’t thinking adequately as a society about the long-term results of our choices. In reality, the solution comes back to prioritizing better foundational education for the next generation, and continuing that education through life.\n\n\n\nQ.  On the lighter side, what is something you’ve seen in our industry over the last year that may or may not be serious, but made you laugh, that we can all learn from?\nA. I get a chuckle every time somebody (almost daily) tells me they can’t decide what job they want to do in cybersecurity. Without fail, they all think they’re the only hacker interested in everything. Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices. People at DEF CON only talk about their cool days. Learn about the other ninety percent of their careers and what they dislike about their jobs. Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable. The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nAs a very open nonbinary and trans person, Lesley says, that while our cybersecurity industry is “much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce,” there is still sometimes threatening levels of backlash, especially for the queer community.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, we had to touch on the potential need for increased cybersecurity diligence overall with the new U.S. presidential administration, especially from an industrial controls systems perspective, and their overall “magic genie” wish for more critical thinking skills about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling.\n\n\n\nRead the interview for more on all of this, as well as why people are drawn to authenticity more than anything, and where to find them on the social web.\n\n\n\nLesley Carhart, Technical Director of Incident Response at Dragos \nQ. You’ve been a strong voice in our industry for some time. Please tell me how your career evolved from the military and throughout your time at Dragos, and the role you play there now.\nA. I’ve always cared deeply about two things – making the world better than I came into it, and understanding how the world works. I had a rather stereotypical path into cybersecurity (as a person who started programming at a very young age), but I’ve always tended towards the circuits and wires of computers and networks that make the world go, not code or abstract concepts. I did this as an aircraft electronics technician in the Air Force, as a network engineering major, and eventually as a cybersecurity person focusing on industrial technology.\n\n\n\nQ. Our industry is quite transient and a lot of people don’t stick to one place for long, yet you’ve been with Dragos for seven years. What is it that drives you to stay?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nA.  A few reasons – first of all, I have zero ethical quandary about what I wake up and do at Dragos every day. I don’t even have to personally adore every single industrial company – it is sufficient that I know that if there is damage to their industrial devices people or the environment may be harmed, and the right thing to do is to protect and restore that infrastructure.Secondly, I love the work, and it’s still pretty niche. There are very few firms doing serious industrial incident response (especially for the caseload we have!) and even fewer that get their hands in every vertical, globally. Dragos is a place where I can make a difference, and I’m challenged by some of the best practitioners in the field.\n\n\n\nQ. What was the transition like from public sector to private sector vendor cybersecurity?\nA. Oh, I have worked in every type and size of organization, public and private over the years. I mentor a lot of young people and I have frequent conversations about the upsides and downsides of choosing government versus a startup, versus a corporation, and so forth. You can do really interesting work and training with the government, and there’s a lot of career and work-life stability in that type of role. However, in startups and small companies you can have a lot faster and more substantial impact on the direction an organization goes in. You can also be less siloed, and make more immediate cash. There are always trade offs. I encourage every young cybersecurity person to explore all of those options.\n\n\n\nQ. I know you’ve been asked this one million times at least, but many people know you as “hacks4pancakes.” I would personally do most anything for a pancake – is there a broader story to this name or do you simply love pancakes?\nA. It’s self-deprecating humor. It’s like “moves for pizzas”. I do a lot of volunteer work in the community. I get paid in food a lot. Don’t ask me for advice on getting rich. At least not rich in money.\n\n\n\nQ. When we talked about doing this interview, you said that repairing relationships between cybersecurity and operational teams is critical, and nontrivial. How do you personally approach this gap and why are you especially passionate about it?\nA. The unfortunate reality of OT cybersecurity today is that enterprise cybersecurity as a practice has soured relationships over a decade through lack of understanding of needs, process safety, and realities of cybersecurity capabilities in process environments. Audits and demands to immediately patch systems without consideration for human life and safety have absolutely caused relationship damage, and there’s now a dangerous level of shadow IT and poor communication between the teams in a lot of organizations. This bleeds into every capability, from architecture, to detection, to incident response, with huge implications. You can’t respond to an emergency if people refuse to speak to one another.\n\n\n\nI think this is really crucial to understand and address in every organization because it not only is essential to building a functional program, but it teaches enterprise cybersecurity people the profound difference in cybersecurity priorities and methods in OT. Start with shadowing and listening to your OT staff. Understand what really matters – real life consequences like process damage or injury. Start to understand the real restrictions and risk measures that limit modern security tooling. Then you can work on cybersecurity moving forward, together. Food helps! Bring doughnuts.\n\n\n\nQ. Whether a security issue or a non-nefarious technical issue, what have you seen as the biggest operational security risk that has been created in the last year? Do you also feel it was properly addressed, and if not, how could we have done better?\nA. Lack of basic realistic planning and testing of plans for incident response. A lot of organizations have some kind of IT incident response plan, or they’ve copied a template from the internet for audit purposes for OT, but the plan lacks adequate tailoring for the real OT environment and testing to assure it will actually work. When seconds count, these organizations are scrambling for days to find basic data on their network architecture or methods to restore OT device backups.\n\n\n\nIncidents are only getting worse and more common in OT as adversaries realize they’re often a soft target with visible real life impacts. Start somewhere. Make a plan for how you will respond to OT-specific incidents and test that plan in tabletops and drills to see if it actually works. It is not a copy-paste from Enterprise.\n\n\n\nQ: Cybersecurity threats in operational environments have been an important focus for some time, and there are concerns that come with the administration change the U.S. is going to have to up our diligence significantly to protect human survival that relies on operational tech. Do you agree with this hot take, or have another perspective entirely?\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ. The same statement applies when it comes to human rights and socioeconomic issues, especially those who fall into under-represented groups. If you agree, what do you think we can do as a cybersecurity industry or community to help? If not, what do you think is the better mindset to have?\nA. The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying. We spend a lot of time talking about electrical power cybersecurity (and it’s definitely a cornerstone of functional society and safety), but that’s partially because that’s the only thing most of us have ever seen fail. In the US, most of us have never seen sewage not work for days, or long-term water cutoffs to our homes. That’s something we are just not equipped for.For underprivileged communities, the gap in resources for cybersecurity in municipal utilities is often even more pronounced. A key part of the battle is informed citizens and legislators recognizing all the places industrial systems keep our modern society working, and considering the implications of them failing or being tampered with. There’s been a lot of good community and governmental work towards closing this gap, but we have a long way to go.\n\n\n\nQ. Early last year you did a talk called “We’re All Scared, Too: 10 Years of Lessons from Cybersecurity Mentorship” for Wild West Hackin’ Fest. What was your biggest takeaway for that audience on the importance of mentorship?\nA. I do a lot of career mentorship through clinics and office hours, and the thing that’s really struck me is how many people have the exact same problems, but no idea they aren’t totally alone in them. In my talk, I spoke about some things I see weekly, like difficulty in choosing a cybersecurity niche, problems with toxic workplaces, the pressure to move to management from a technical role, and even burnout. They need a stranger like me to tell them it’s normal and okay, and help them tackle those problems. Sadly, I’m usually booked out for months because of the massive demand for mentorship. We need more senior people stepping up and taking on formal and organized mentorship roles. People need an outside ear and unbiased perspective.\n\n\n\nQ.

We are prioritizing the wrong things, and jumping ahead of the basics. We aren’t thinking adequately as a society about the long-term results of our choices. In reality, the solution comes back to prioritizing better foundational education for the next generation, and continuing that education through life.\n\n\n\nQ.  On the lighter side, what is something you’ve seen in our industry over the last year that may or may not be serious, but made you laugh, that we can all learn from?\nA. I get a chuckle every time somebody (almost daily) tells me they can’t decide what job they want to do in cybersecurity. Without fail, they all think they’re the only hacker interested in everything. Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices. People at DEF CON only talk about their cool days. Learn about the other ninety percent of their careers and what they dislike about their jobs. Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable. The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nRead the interview for more on all of this, as well as why people are drawn to authenticity more than anything, and where to find them on the social web.\n\n\n\nLesley Carhart, Technical Director of Incident Response at Dragos \nQ. You’ve been a strong voice in our industry for some time. Please tell me how your career evolved from the military and throughout your time at Dragos, and the role you play there now.\nA. I’ve always cared deeply about two things – making the world better than I came into it, and understanding how the world works. I had a rather stereotypical path into cybersecurity (as a person who started programming at a very young age), but I’ve always tended towards the circuits and wires of computers and networks that make the world go, not code or abstract concepts. I did this as an aircraft electronics technician in the Air Force, as a network engineering major, and eventually as a cybersecurity person focusing on industrial technology.\n\n\n\nQ. Our industry is quite transient and a lot of people don’t stick to one place for long, yet you’ve been with Dragos for seven years. What is it that drives you to stay?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nA.  A few reasons – first of all, I have zero ethical quandary about what I wake up and do at Dragos every day. I don’t even have to personally adore every single industrial company – it is sufficient that I know that if there is damage to their industrial devices people or the environment may be harmed, and the right thing to do is to protect and restore that infrastructure.Secondly, I love the work, and it’s still pretty niche. There are very few firms doing serious industrial incident response (especially for the caseload we have!) and even fewer that get their hands in every vertical, globally. Dragos is a place where I can make a difference, and I’m challenged by some of the best practitioners in the field.\n\n\n\nQ. What was the transition like from public sector to private sector vendor cybersecurity?\nA. Oh, I have worked in every type and size of organization, public and private over the years. I mentor a lot of young people and I have frequent conversations about the upsides and downsides of choosing government versus a startup, versus a corporation, and so forth. You can do really interesting work and training with the government, and there’s a lot of career and work-life stability in that type of role. However, in startups and small companies you can have a lot faster and more substantial impact on the direction an organization goes in. You can also be less siloed, and make more immediate cash. There are always trade offs. I encourage every young cybersecurity person to explore all of those options.\n\n\n\nQ. I know you’ve been asked this one million times at least, but many people know you as “hacks4pancakes.” I would personally do most anything for a pancake – is there a broader story to this name or do you simply love pancakes?\nA. It’s self-deprecating humor. It’s like “moves for pizzas”. I do a lot of volunteer work in the community. I get paid in food a lot. Don’t ask me for advice on getting rich. At least not rich in money.\n\n\n\nQ. When we talked about doing this interview, you said that repairing relationships between cybersecurity and operational teams is critical, and nontrivial. How do you personally approach this gap and why are you especially passionate about it?\nA. The unfortunate reality of OT cybersecurity today is that enterprise cybersecurity as a practice has soured relationships over a decade through lack of understanding of needs, process safety, and realities of cybersecurity capabilities in process environments. Audits and demands to immediately patch systems without consideration for human life and safety have absolutely caused relationship damage, and there’s now a dangerous level of shadow IT and poor communication between the teams in a lot of organizations. This bleeds into every capability, from architecture, to detection, to incident response, with huge implications. You can’t respond to an emergency if people refuse to speak to one another.\n\n\n\nI think this is really crucial to understand and address in every organization because it not only is essential to building a functional program, but it teaches enterprise cybersecurity people the profound difference in cybersecurity priorities and methods in OT. Start with shadowing and listening to your OT staff. Understand what really matters – real life consequences like process damage or injury. Start to understand the real restrictions and risk measures that limit modern security tooling. Then you can work on cybersecurity moving forward, together. Food helps! Bring doughnuts.\n\n\n\nQ. Whether a security issue or a non-nefarious technical issue, what have you seen as the biggest operational security risk that has been created in the last year? Do you also feel it was properly addressed, and if not, how could we have done better?\nA. Lack of basic realistic planning and testing of plans for incident response. A lot of organizations have some kind of IT incident response plan, or they’ve copied a template from the internet for audit purposes for OT, but the plan lacks adequate tailoring for the real OT environment and testing to assure it will actually work. When seconds count, these organizations are scrambling for days to find basic data on their network architecture or methods to restore OT device backups.\n\n\n\nIncidents are only getting worse and more common in OT as adversaries realize they’re often a soft target with visible real life impacts. Start somewhere. Make a plan for how you will respond to OT-specific incidents and test that plan in tabletops and drills to see if it actually works. It is not a copy-paste from Enterprise.\n\n\n\nQ: Cybersecurity threats in operational environments have been an important focus for some time, and there are concerns that come with the administration change the U.S. is going to have to up our diligence significantly to protect human survival that relies on operational tech. Do you agree with this hot take, or have another perspective entirely?\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ. The same statement applies when it comes to human rights and socioeconomic issues, especially those who fall into under-represented groups. If you agree, what do you think we can do as a cybersecurity industry or community to help? If not, what do you think is the better mindset to have?\nA. The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying. We spend a lot of time talking about electrical power cybersecurity (and it’s definitely a cornerstone of functional society and safety), but that’s partially because that’s the only thing most of us have ever seen fail. In the US, most of us have never seen sewage not work for days, or long-term water cutoffs to our homes. That’s something we are just not equipped for.For underprivileged communities, the gap in resources for cybersecurity in municipal utilities is often even more pronounced. A key part of the battle is informed citizens and legislators recognizing all the places industrial systems keep our modern society working, and considering the implications of them failing or being tampered with. There’s been a lot of good community and governmental work towards closing this gap, but we have a long way to go.\n\n\n\nQ. Early last year you did a talk called “We’re All Scared, Too: 10 Years of Lessons from Cybersecurity Mentorship” for Wild West Hackin’ Fest. What was your biggest takeaway for that audience on the importance of mentorship?\nA. I do a lot of career mentorship through clinics and office hours, and the thing that’s really struck me is how many people have the exact same problems, but no idea they aren’t totally alone in them. In my talk, I spoke about some things I see weekly, like difficulty in choosing a cybersecurity niche, problems with toxic workplaces, the pressure to move to management from a technical role, and even burnout. They need a stranger like me to tell them it’s normal and okay, and help them tackle those problems. Sadly, I’m usually booked out for months because of the massive demand for mentorship. We need more senior people stepping up and taking on formal and organized mentorship roles. People need an outside ear and unbiased perspective.\n\n\n\nQ. I found a tweet from more than two years ago from you that said: “Hi, just a gentle nudge that it is pride month, and I’m very genuinely non-binary / trans, and that is a meaningful thing to me – not a fad. I very much admire you all’s support of women, who I share many experiences with and support too, but code switching is exhausting.” Do you feel as if, at least within our industry, less “code switching” is necessary and there is more outward, dedicated support for non-binary and/or trans people?\nA. In my personal experience, cybersecurity is much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce. We have a robust community and good social support groups. That said, queer people today are facing the same cultural backlash in IT as anywhere else in society. I work in a customer-facing role. I’m active in the media and as a professional speaker. Sometimes I have to appear unremarkable and inoffensive to the audience to get the job done, and it sucks. I don’t know what the right answer is. I’ll continue to do everything I can to make everyone welcome in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this interview was conducted, Lesley announced a move to Melbourne, Australia, and will continue acting as Technical Director of Incident Response for Dragos.\nQ. Speaking of “former Twitter,” have you fully made the move to BlueSky like so many others? In other words, where can people best find you now?\nA. I left Twitter two years ago for ethical reasons and I have not looked back. I’m active on LinkedIn, Mastodon (Jerry Bell’s infosec.exchange instance), Bluesky, Threads, and Instagram. I also have a YouTube and a blog. A plethora of ways to find me and keep in touch, should the reader wish to. I love making new pals!\n\n\n\nQ.  We’ve covered a lot of topics so far, from your career to the state of the world to the issues affecting humans. What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly. We are prioritizing the wrong things, and jumping ahead of the basics. We aren’t thinking adequately as a society about the long-term results of our choices.

The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nA. I’ve always cared deeply about two things – making the world better than I came into it, and understanding how the world works. I had a rather stereotypical path into cybersecurity (as a person who started programming at a very young age), but I’ve always tended towards the circuits and wires of computers and networks that make the world go, not code or abstract concepts. I did this as an aircraft electronics technician in the Air Force, as a network engineering major, and eventually as a cybersecurity person focusing on industrial technology.\n\n\n\nQ. Our industry is quite transient and a lot of people don’t stick to one place for long, yet you’ve been with Dragos for seven years. What is it that drives you to stay?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nA.  A few reasons – first of all, I have zero ethical quandary about what I wake up and do at Dragos every day. I don’t even have to personally adore every single industrial company – it is sufficient that I know that if there is damage to their industrial devices people or the environment may be harmed, and the right thing to do is to protect and restore that infrastructure.Secondly, I love the work, and it’s still pretty niche. There are very few firms doing serious industrial incident response (especially for the caseload we have!) and even fewer that get their hands in every vertical, globally. Dragos is a place where I can make a difference, and I’m challenged by some of the best practitioners in the field.\n\n\n\nQ. What was the transition like from public sector to private sector vendor cybersecurity?\nA. Oh, I have worked in every type and size of organization, public and private over the years. I mentor a lot of young people and I have frequent conversations about the upsides and downsides of choosing government versus a startup, versus a corporation, and so forth. You can do really interesting work and training with the government, and there’s a lot of career and work-life stability in that type of role. However, in startups and small companies you can have a lot faster and more substantial impact on the direction an organization goes in. You can also be less siloed, and make more immediate cash. There are always trade offs. I encourage every young cybersecurity person to explore all of those options.\n\n\n\nQ. I know you’ve been asked this one million times at least, but many people know you as “hacks4pancakes.” I would personally do most anything for a pancake – is there a broader story to this name or do you simply love pancakes?\nA. It’s self-deprecating humor. It’s like “moves for pizzas”. I do a lot of volunteer work in the community. I get paid in food a lot. Don’t ask me for advice on getting rich. At least not rich in money.\n\n\n\nQ. When we talked about doing this interview, you said that repairing relationships between cybersecurity and operational teams is critical, and nontrivial. How do you personally approach this gap and why are you especially passionate about it?\nA. The unfortunate reality of OT cybersecurity today is that enterprise cybersecurity as a practice has soured relationships over a decade through lack of understanding of needs, process safety, and realities of cybersecurity capabilities in process environments. Audits and demands to immediately patch systems without consideration for human life and safety have absolutely caused relationship damage, and there’s now a dangerous level of shadow IT and poor communication between the teams in a lot of organizations. This bleeds into every capability, from architecture, to detection, to incident response, with huge implications. You can’t respond to an emergency if people refuse to speak to one another.\n\n\n\nI think this is really crucial to understand and address in every organization because it not only is essential to building a functional program, but it teaches enterprise cybersecurity people the profound difference in cybersecurity priorities and methods in OT. Start with shadowing and listening to your OT staff. Understand what really matters – real life consequences like process damage or injury. Start to understand the real restrictions and risk measures that limit modern security tooling. Then you can work on cybersecurity moving forward, together. Food helps! Bring doughnuts.\n\n\n\nQ. Whether a security issue or a non-nefarious technical issue, what have you seen as the biggest operational security risk that has been created in the last year? Do you also feel it was properly addressed, and if not, how could we have done better?\nA. Lack of basic realistic planning and testing of plans for incident response. A lot of organizations have some kind of IT incident response plan, or they’ve copied a template from the internet for audit purposes for OT, but the plan lacks adequate tailoring for the real OT environment and testing to assure it will actually work. When seconds count, these organizations are scrambling for days to find basic data on their network architecture or methods to restore OT device backups.\n\n\n\nIncidents are only getting worse and more common in OT as adversaries realize they’re often a soft target with visible real life impacts. Start somewhere. Make a plan for how you will respond to OT-specific incidents and test that plan in tabletops and drills to see if it actually works. It is not a copy-paste from Enterprise.\n\n\n\nQ: Cybersecurity threats in operational environments have been an important focus for some time, and there are concerns that come with the administration change the U.S. is going to have to up our diligence significantly to protect human survival that relies on operational tech. Do you agree with this hot take, or have another perspective entirely?\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ. The same statement applies when it comes to human rights and socioeconomic issues, especially those who fall into under-represented groups. If you agree, what do you think we can do as a cybersecurity industry or community to help? If not, what do you think is the better mindset to have?\nA. The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying. We spend a lot of time talking about electrical power cybersecurity (and it’s definitely a cornerstone of functional society and safety), but that’s partially because that’s the only thing most of us have ever seen fail. In the US, most of us have never seen sewage not work for days, or long-term water cutoffs to our homes. That’s something we are just not equipped for.For underprivileged communities, the gap in resources for cybersecurity in municipal utilities is often even more pronounced. A key part of the battle is informed citizens and legislators recognizing all the places industrial systems keep our modern society working, and considering the implications of them failing or being tampered with. There’s been a lot of good community and governmental work towards closing this gap, but we have a long way to go.\n\n\n\nQ. Early last year you did a talk called “We’re All Scared, Too: 10 Years of Lessons from Cybersecurity Mentorship” for Wild West Hackin’ Fest. What was your biggest takeaway for that audience on the importance of mentorship?\nA. I do a lot of career mentorship through clinics and office hours, and the thing that’s really struck me is how many people have the exact same problems, but no idea they aren’t totally alone in them. In my talk, I spoke about some things I see weekly, like difficulty in choosing a cybersecurity niche, problems with toxic workplaces, the pressure to move to management from a technical role, and even burnout. They need a stranger like me to tell them it’s normal and okay, and help them tackle those problems. Sadly, I’m usually booked out for months because of the massive demand for mentorship. We need more senior people stepping up and taking on formal and organized mentorship roles. People need an outside ear and unbiased perspective.\n\n\n\nQ. I found a tweet from more than two years ago from you that said: “Hi, just a gentle nudge that it is pride month, and I’m very genuinely non-binary / trans, and that is a meaningful thing to me – not a fad. I very much admire you all’s support of women, who I share many experiences with and support too, but code switching is exhausting.” Do you feel as if, at least within our industry, less “code switching” is necessary and there is more outward, dedicated support for non-binary and/or trans people?\nA. In my personal experience, cybersecurity is much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce. We have a robust community and good social support groups. That said, queer people today are facing the same cultural backlash in IT as anywhere else in society. I work in a customer-facing role. I’m active in the media and as a professional speaker. Sometimes I have to appear unremarkable and inoffensive to the audience to get the job done, and it sucks. I don’t know what the right answer is. I’ll continue to do everything I can to make everyone welcome in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this interview was conducted, Lesley announced a move to Melbourne, Australia, and will continue acting as Technical Director of Incident Response for Dragos.\nQ. Speaking of “former Twitter,” have you fully made the move to BlueSky like so many others? In other words, where can people best find you now?\nA. I left Twitter two years ago for ethical reasons and I have not looked back. I’m active on LinkedIn, Mastodon (Jerry Bell’s infosec.exchange instance), Bluesky, Threads, and Instagram. I also have a YouTube and a blog. A plethora of ways to find me and keep in touch, should the reader wish to. I love making new pals!\n\n\n\nQ.  We’ve covered a lot of topics so far, from your career to the state of the world to the issues affecting humans. What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly. We are prioritizing the wrong things, and jumping ahead of the basics. We aren’t thinking adequately as a society about the long-term results of our choices. In reality, the solution comes back to prioritizing better foundational education for the next generation, and continuing that education through life.\n\n\n\nQ.  On the lighter side, what is something you’ve seen in our industry over the last year that may or may not be serious, but made you laugh, that we can all learn from?\nA. I get a chuckle every time somebody (almost daily) tells me they can’t decide what job they want to do in cybersecurity. Without fail, they all think they’re the only hacker interested in everything. Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices. People at DEF CON only talk about their cool days. Learn about the other ninety percent of their careers and what they dislike about their jobs. Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable. The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nQ.

Do you agree with this hot take, or have another perspective entirely?\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ. The same statement applies when it comes to human rights and socioeconomic issues, especially those who fall into under-represented groups. If you agree, what do you think we can do as a cybersecurity industry or community to help? If not, what do you think is the better mindset to have?\nA. The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying. We spend a lot of time talking about electrical power cybersecurity (and it’s definitely a cornerstone of functional society and safety), but that’s partially because that’s the only thing most of us have ever seen fail. In the US, most of us have never seen sewage not work for days, or long-term water cutoffs to our homes. That’s something we are just not equipped for.For underprivileged communities, the gap in resources for cybersecurity in municipal utilities is often even more pronounced. A key part of the battle is informed citizens and legislators recognizing all the places industrial systems keep our modern society working, and considering the implications of them failing or being tampered with. There’s been a lot of good community and governmental work towards closing this gap, but we have a long way to go.\n\n\n\nQ. Early last year you did a talk called “We’re All Scared, Too: 10 Years of Lessons from Cybersecurity Mentorship” for Wild West Hackin’ Fest. What was your biggest takeaway for that audience on the importance of mentorship?\nA. I do a lot of career mentorship through clinics and office hours, and the thing that’s really struck me is how many people have the exact same problems, but no idea they aren’t totally alone in them. In my talk, I spoke about some things I see weekly, like difficulty in choosing a cybersecurity niche, problems with toxic workplaces, the pressure to move to management from a technical role, and even burnout. They need a stranger like me to tell them it’s normal and okay, and help them tackle those problems. Sadly, I’m usually booked out for months because of the massive demand for mentorship. We need more senior people stepping up and taking on formal and organized mentorship roles. People need an outside ear and unbiased perspective.\n\n\n\nQ. I found a tweet from more than two years ago from you that said: “Hi, just a gentle nudge that it is pride month, and I’m very genuinely non-binary / trans, and that is a meaningful thing to me – not a fad. I very much admire you all’s support of women, who I share many experiences with and support too, but code switching is exhausting.” Do you feel as if, at least within our industry, less “code switching” is necessary and there is more outward, dedicated support for non-binary and/or trans people?\nA. In my personal experience, cybersecurity is much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce. We have a robust community and good social support groups. That said, queer people today are facing the same cultural backlash in IT as anywhere else in society. I work in a customer-facing role. I’m active in the media and as a professional speaker. Sometimes I have to appear unremarkable and inoffensive to the audience to get the job done, and it sucks. I don’t know what the right answer is. I’ll continue to do everything I can to make everyone welcome in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this interview was conducted, Lesley announced a move to Melbourne, Australia, and will continue acting as Technical Director of Incident Response for Dragos.\nQ. Speaking of “former Twitter,” have you fully made the move to BlueSky like so many others? In other words, where can people best find you now?\nA. I left Twitter two years ago for ethical reasons and I have not looked back. I’m active on LinkedIn, Mastodon (Jerry Bell’s infosec.exchange instance), Bluesky, Threads, and Instagram. I also have a YouTube and a blog. A plethora of ways to find me and keep in touch, should the reader wish to. I love making new pals!\n\n\n\nQ.  We’ve covered a lot of topics so far, from your career to the state of the world to the issues affecting humans. What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly. We are prioritizing the wrong things, and jumping ahead of the basics. We aren’t thinking adequately as a society about the long-term results of our choices. In reality, the solution comes back to prioritizing better foundational education for the next generation, and continuing that education through life.\n\n\n\nQ.  On the lighter side, what is something you’ve seen in our industry over the last year that may or may not be serious, but made you laugh, that we can all learn from?\nA. I get a chuckle every time somebody (almost daily) tells me they can’t decide what job they want to do in cybersecurity. Without fail, they all think they’re the only hacker interested in everything. Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices. People at DEF CON only talk about their cool days. Learn about the other ninety percent of their careers and what they dislike about their jobs. Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable. The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nQ. What was the transition like from public sector to private sector vendor cybersecurity?\nA. Oh, I have worked in every type and size of organization, public and private over the years. I mentor a lot of young people and I have frequent conversations about the upsides and downsides of choosing government versus a startup, versus a corporation, and so forth. You can do really interesting work and training with the government, and there’s a lot of career and work-life stability in that type of role. However, in startups and small companies you can have a lot faster and more substantial impact on the direction an organization goes in. You can also be less siloed, and make more immediate cash. There are always trade offs. I encourage every young cybersecurity person to explore all of those options.\n\n\n\nQ. I know you’ve been asked this one million times at least, but many people know you as “hacks4pancakes.” I would personally do most anything for a pancake – is there a broader story to this name or do you simply love pancakes?\nA. It’s self-deprecating humor. It’s like “moves for pizzas”. I do a lot of volunteer work in the community. I get paid in food a lot. Don’t ask me for advice on getting rich. At least not rich in money.\n\n\n\nQ. When we talked about doing this interview, you said that repairing relationships between cybersecurity and operational teams is critical, and nontrivial. How do you personally approach this gap and why are you especially passionate about it?\nA. The unfortunate reality of OT cybersecurity today is that enterprise cybersecurity as a practice has soured relationships over a decade through lack of understanding of needs, process safety, and realities of cybersecurity capabilities in process environments. Audits and demands to immediately patch systems without consideration for human life and safety have absolutely caused relationship damage, and there’s now a dangerous level of shadow IT and poor communication between the teams in a lot of organizations. This bleeds into every capability, from architecture, to detection, to incident response, with huge implications. You can’t respond to an emergency if people refuse to speak to one another.\n\n\n\nI think this is really crucial to understand and address in every organization because it not only is essential to building a functional program, but it teaches enterprise cybersecurity people the profound difference in cybersecurity priorities and methods in OT. Start with shadowing and listening to your OT staff. Understand what really matters – real life consequences like process damage or injury. Start to understand the real restrictions and risk measures that limit modern security tooling. Then you can work on cybersecurity moving forward, together. Food helps! Bring doughnuts.\n\n\n\nQ. Whether a security issue or a non-nefarious technical issue, what have you seen as the biggest operational security risk that has been created in the last year? Do you also feel it was properly addressed, and if not, how could we have done better?\nA. Lack of basic realistic planning and testing of plans for incident response. A lot of organizations have some kind of IT incident response plan, or they’ve copied a template from the internet for audit purposes for OT, but the plan lacks adequate tailoring for the real OT environment and testing to assure it will actually work. When seconds count, these organizations are scrambling for days to find basic data on their network architecture or methods to restore OT device backups.\n\n\n\nIncidents are only getting worse and more common in OT as adversaries realize they’re often a soft target with visible real life impacts. Start somewhere. Make a plan for how you will respond to OT-specific incidents and test that plan in tabletops and drills to see if it actually works. It is not a copy-paste from Enterprise.\n\n\n\nQ: Cybersecurity threats in operational environments have been an important focus for some time, and there are concerns that come with the administration change the U.S. is going to have to up our diligence significantly to protect human survival that relies on operational tech. Do you agree with this hot take, or have another perspective entirely?\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ.

The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying.

Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable. The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nQ. I know you’ve been asked this one million times at least, but many people know you as “hacks4pancakes.” I would personally do most anything for a pancake – is there a broader story to this name or do you simply love pancakes?\nA. It’s self-deprecating humor. It’s like “moves for pizzas”. I do a lot of volunteer work in the community. I get paid in food a lot. Don’t ask me for advice on getting rich. At least not rich in money.\n\n\n\nQ. When we talked about doing this interview, you said that repairing relationships between cybersecurity and operational teams is critical, and nontrivial. How do you personally approach this gap and why are you especially passionate about it?\nA. The unfortunate reality of OT cybersecurity today is that enterprise cybersecurity as a practice has soured relationships over a decade through lack of understanding of needs, process safety, and realities of cybersecurity capabilities in process environments. Audits and demands to immediately patch systems without consideration for human life and safety have absolutely caused relationship damage, and there’s now a dangerous level of shadow IT and poor communication between the teams in a lot of organizations. This bleeds into every capability, from architecture, to detection, to incident response, with huge implications. You can’t respond to an emergency if people refuse to speak to one another.\n\n\n\nI think this is really crucial to understand and address in every organization because it not only is essential to building a functional program, but it teaches enterprise cybersecurity people the profound difference in cybersecurity priorities and methods in OT. Start with shadowing and listening to your OT staff. Understand what really matters – real life consequences like process damage or injury. Start to understand the real restrictions and risk measures that limit modern security tooling. Then you can work on cybersecurity moving forward, together. Food helps! Bring doughnuts.\n\n\n\nQ. Whether a security issue or a non-nefarious technical issue, what have you seen as the biggest operational security risk that has been created in the last year? Do you also feel it was properly addressed, and if not, how could we have done better?\nA. Lack of basic realistic planning and testing of plans for incident response. A lot of organizations have some kind of IT incident response plan, or they’ve copied a template from the internet for audit purposes for OT, but the plan lacks adequate tailoring for the real OT environment and testing to assure it will actually work. When seconds count, these organizations are scrambling for days to find basic data on their network architecture or methods to restore OT device backups.\n\n\n\nIncidents are only getting worse and more common in OT as adversaries realize they’re often a soft target with visible real life impacts. Start somewhere. Make a plan for how you will respond to OT-specific incidents and test that plan in tabletops and drills to see if it actually works. It is not a copy-paste from Enterprise.\n\n\n\nQ: Cybersecurity threats in operational environments have been an important focus for some time, and there are concerns that come with the administration change the U.S. is going to have to up our diligence significantly to protect human survival that relies on operational tech. Do you agree with this hot take, or have another perspective entirely?\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ. The same statement applies when it comes to human rights and socioeconomic issues, especially those who fall into under-represented groups. If you agree, what do you think we can do as a cybersecurity industry or community to help? If not, what do you think is the better mindset to have?\nA. The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying. We spend a lot of time talking about electrical power cybersecurity (and it’s definitely a cornerstone of functional society and safety), but that’s partially because that’s the only thing most of us have ever seen fail. In the US, most of us have never seen sewage not work for days, or long-term water cutoffs to our homes. That’s something we are just not equipped for.For underprivileged communities, the gap in resources for cybersecurity in municipal utilities is often even more pronounced. A key part of the battle is informed citizens and legislators recognizing all the places industrial systems keep our modern society working, and considering the implications of them failing or being tampered with. There’s been a lot of good community and governmental work towards closing this gap, but we have a long way to go.\n\n\n\nQ. Early last year you did a talk called “We’re All Scared, Too: 10 Years of Lessons from Cybersecurity Mentorship” for Wild West Hackin’ Fest. What was your biggest takeaway for that audience on the importance of mentorship?\nA. I do a lot of career mentorship through clinics and office hours, and the thing that’s really struck me is how many people have the exact same problems, but no idea they aren’t totally alone in them. In my talk, I spoke about some things I see weekly, like difficulty in choosing a cybersecurity niche, problems with toxic workplaces, the pressure to move to management from a technical role, and even burnout. They need a stranger like me to tell them it’s normal and okay, and help them tackle those problems. Sadly, I’m usually booked out for months because of the massive demand for mentorship. We need more senior people stepping up and taking on formal and organized mentorship roles. People need an outside ear and unbiased perspective.\n\n\n\nQ. I found a tweet from more than two years ago from you that said: “Hi, just a gentle nudge that it is pride month, and I’m very genuinely non-binary / trans, and that is a meaningful thing to me – not a fad. I very much admire you all’s support of women, who I share many experiences with and support too, but code switching is exhausting.” Do you feel as if, at least within our industry, less “code switching” is necessary and there is more outward, dedicated support for non-binary and/or trans people?\nA. In my personal experience, cybersecurity is much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce. We have a robust community and good social support groups. That said, queer people today are facing the same cultural backlash in IT as anywhere else in society. I work in a customer-facing role. I’m active in the media and as a professional speaker. Sometimes I have to appear unremarkable and inoffensive to the audience to get the job done, and it sucks. I don’t know what the right answer is. I’ll continue to do everything I can to make everyone welcome in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this interview was conducted, Lesley announced a move to Melbourne, Australia, and will continue acting as Technical Director of Incident Response for Dragos.\nQ. Speaking of “former Twitter,” have you fully made the move to BlueSky like so many others? In other words, where can people best find you now?\nA. I left Twitter two years ago for ethical reasons and I have not looked back. I’m active on LinkedIn, Mastodon (Jerry Bell’s infosec.exchange instance), Bluesky, Threads, and Instagram. I also have a YouTube and a blog. A plethora of ways to find me and keep in touch, should the reader wish to. I love making new pals!\n\n\n\nQ.  We’ve covered a lot of topics so far, from your career to the state of the world to the issues affecting humans. What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly. We are prioritizing the wrong things, and jumping ahead of the basics. We aren’t thinking adequately as a society about the long-term results of our choices. In reality, the solution comes back to prioritizing better foundational education for the next generation, and continuing that education through life.\n\n\n\nQ.  On the lighter side, what is something you’ve seen in our industry over the last year that may or may not be serious, but made you laugh, that we can all learn from?\nA. I get a chuckle every time somebody (almost daily) tells me they can’t decide what job they want to do in cybersecurity. Without fail, they all think they’re the only hacker interested in everything. Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices.

I found a tweet from more than two years ago from you that said: “Hi, just a gentle nudge that it is pride month, and I’m very genuinely non-binary / trans, and that is a meaningful thing to me – not a fad. I very much admire you all’s support of women, who I share many experiences with and support too, but code switching is exhausting.” Do you feel as if, at least within our industry, less “code switching” is necessary and there is more outward, dedicated support for non-binary and/or trans people?\nA. In my personal experience, cybersecurity is much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce. We have a robust community and good social support groups. That said, queer people today are facing the same cultural backlash in IT as anywhere else in society. I work in a customer-facing role. I’m active in the media and as a professional speaker. Sometimes I have to appear unremarkable and inoffensive to the audience to get the job done, and it sucks. I don’t know what the right answer is. I’ll continue to do everything I can to make everyone welcome in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this interview was conducted, Lesley announced a move to Melbourne, Australia, and will continue acting as Technical Director of Incident Response for Dragos.\nQ. Speaking of “former Twitter,” have you fully made the move to BlueSky like so many others? In other words, where can people best find you now?\nA. I left Twitter two years ago for ethical reasons and I have not looked back. I’m active on LinkedIn, Mastodon (Jerry Bell’s infosec.exchange instance), Bluesky, Threads, and Instagram. I also have a YouTube and a blog. A plethora of ways to find me and keep in touch, should the reader wish to. I love making new pals!\n\n\n\nQ.  We’ve covered a lot of topics so far, from your career to the state of the world to the issues affecting humans. What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly. We are prioritizing the wrong things, and jumping ahead of the basics. We aren’t thinking adequately as a society about the long-term results of our choices. In reality, the solution comes back to prioritizing better foundational education for the next generation, and continuing that education through life.\n\n\n\nQ.  On the lighter side, what is something you’ve seen in our industry over the last year that may or may not be serious, but made you laugh, that we can all learn from?\nA. I get a chuckle every time somebody (almost daily) tells me they can’t decide what job they want to do in cybersecurity. Without fail, they all think they’re the only hacker interested in everything. Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices. People at DEF CON only talk about their cool days. Learn about the other ninety percent of their careers and what they dislike about their jobs. Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable. The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nA. The unfortunate reality of OT cybersecurity today is that enterprise cybersecurity as a practice has soured relationships over a decade through lack of understanding of needs, process safety, and realities of cybersecurity capabilities in process environments. Audits and demands to immediately patch systems without consideration for human life and safety have absolutely caused relationship damage, and there’s now a dangerous level of shadow IT and poor communication between the teams in a lot of organizations. This bleeds into every capability, from architecture, to detection, to incident response, with huge implications. You can’t respond to an emergency if people refuse to speak to one another.\n\n\n\nI think this is really crucial to understand and address in every organization because it not only is essential to building a functional program, but it teaches enterprise cybersecurity people the profound difference in cybersecurity priorities and methods in OT. Start with shadowing and listening to your OT staff. Understand what really matters – real life consequences like process damage or injury. Start to understand the real restrictions and risk measures that limit modern security tooling. Then you can work on cybersecurity moving forward, together. Food helps! Bring doughnuts.\n\n\n\nQ. Whether a security issue or a non-nefarious technical issue, what have you seen as the biggest operational security risk that has been created in the last year? Do you also feel it was properly addressed, and if not, how could we have done better?\nA. Lack of basic realistic planning and testing of plans for incident response. A lot of organizations have some kind of IT incident response plan, or they’ve copied a template from the internet for audit purposes for OT, but the plan lacks adequate tailoring for the real OT environment and testing to assure it will actually work. When seconds count, these organizations are scrambling for days to find basic data on their network architecture or methods to restore OT device backups.\n\n\n\nIncidents are only getting worse and more common in OT as adversaries realize they’re often a soft target with visible real life impacts. Start somewhere. Make a plan for how you will respond to OT-specific incidents and test that plan in tabletops and drills to see if it actually works. It is not a copy-paste from Enterprise.\n\n\n\nQ: Cybersecurity threats in operational environments have been an important focus for some time, and there are concerns that come with the administration change the U.S. is going to have to up our diligence significantly to protect human survival that relies on operational tech. Do you agree with this hot take, or have another perspective entirely?\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ. The same statement applies when it comes to human rights and socioeconomic issues, especially those who fall into under-represented groups. If you agree, what do you think we can do as a cybersecurity industry or community to help? If not, what do you think is the better mindset to have?\nA. The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying. We spend a lot of time talking about electrical power cybersecurity (and it’s definitely a cornerstone of functional society and safety), but that’s partially because that’s the only thing most of us have ever seen fail. In the US, most of us have never seen sewage not work for days, or long-term water cutoffs to our homes. That’s something we are just not equipped for.For underprivileged communities, the gap in resources for cybersecurity in municipal utilities is often even more pronounced. A key part of the battle is informed citizens and legislators recognizing all the places industrial systems keep our modern society working, and considering the implications of them failing or being tampered with. There’s been a lot of good community and governmental work towards closing this gap, but we have a long way to go.\n\n\n\nQ. Early last year you did a talk called “We’re All Scared, Too: 10 Years of Lessons from Cybersecurity Mentorship” for Wild West Hackin’ Fest. What was your biggest takeaway for that audience on the importance of mentorship?\nA. I do a lot of career mentorship through clinics and office hours, and the thing that’s really struck me is how many people have the exact same problems, but no idea they aren’t totally alone in them. In my talk, I spoke about some things I see weekly, like difficulty in choosing a cybersecurity niche, problems with toxic workplaces, the pressure to move to management from a technical role, and even burnout. They need a stranger like me to tell them it’s normal and okay, and help them tackle those problems. Sadly, I’m usually booked out for months because of the massive demand for mentorship. We need more senior people stepping up and taking on formal and organized mentorship roles. People need an outside ear and unbiased perspective.\n\n\n\nQ.

In my talk, I spoke about some things I see weekly, like difficulty in choosing a cybersecurity niche, problems with toxic workplaces, the pressure to move to management from a technical role, and even burnout. They need a stranger like me to tell them it’s normal and okay, and help them tackle those problems. Sadly, I’m usually booked out for months because of the massive demand for mentorship. We need more senior people stepping up and taking on formal and organized mentorship roles. People need an outside ear and unbiased perspective.\n\n\n\nQ. I found a tweet from more than two years ago from you that said: “Hi, just a gentle nudge that it is pride month, and I’m very genuinely non-binary / trans, and that is a meaningful thing to me – not a fad. I very much admire you all’s support of women, who I share many experiences with and support too, but code switching is exhausting.” Do you feel as if, at least within our industry, less “code switching” is necessary and there is more outward, dedicated support for non-binary and/or trans people?\nA. In my personal experience, cybersecurity is much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce. We have a robust community and good social support groups. That said, queer people today are facing the same cultural backlash in IT as anywhere else in society. I work in a customer-facing role. I’m active in the media and as a professional speaker. Sometimes I have to appear unremarkable and inoffensive to the audience to get the job done, and it sucks. I don’t know what the right answer is. I’ll continue to do everything I can to make everyone welcome in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this interview was conducted, Lesley announced a move to Melbourne, Australia, and will continue acting as Technical Director of Incident Response for Dragos.\nQ. Speaking of “former Twitter,” have you fully made the move to BlueSky like so many others? In other words, where can people best find you now?\nA. I left Twitter two years ago for ethical reasons and I have not looked back. I’m active on LinkedIn, Mastodon (Jerry Bell’s infosec.exchange instance), Bluesky, Threads, and Instagram. I also have a YouTube and a blog. A plethora of ways to find me and keep in touch, should the reader wish to. I love making new pals!\n\n\n\nQ.  We’ve covered a lot of topics so far, from your career to the state of the world to the issues affecting humans. What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly. We are prioritizing the wrong things, and jumping ahead of the basics. We aren’t thinking adequately as a society about the long-term results of our choices. In reality, the solution comes back to prioritizing better foundational education for the next generation, and continuing that education through life.\n\n\n\nQ.  On the lighter side, what is something you’ve seen in our industry over the last year that may or may not be serious, but made you laugh, that we can all learn from?\nA. I get a chuckle every time somebody (almost daily) tells me they can’t decide what job they want to do in cybersecurity. Without fail, they all think they’re the only hacker interested in everything. Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices. People at DEF CON only talk about their cool days. Learn about the other ninety percent of their careers and what they dislike about their jobs. Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable. The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nA. Lack of basic realistic planning and testing of plans for incident response. A lot of organizations have some kind of IT incident response plan, or they’ve copied a template from the internet for audit purposes for OT, but the plan lacks adequate tailoring for the real OT environment and testing to assure it will actually work. When seconds count, these organizations are scrambling for days to find basic data on their network architecture or methods to restore OT device backups.\n\n\n\nIncidents are only getting worse and more common in OT as adversaries realize they’re often a soft target with visible real life impacts. Start somewhere. Make a plan for how you will respond to OT-specific incidents and test that plan in tabletops and drills to see if it actually works. It is not a copy-paste from Enterprise.\n\n\n\nQ: Cybersecurity threats in operational environments have been an important focus for some time, and there are concerns that come with the administration change the U.S. is going to have to up our diligence significantly to protect human survival that relies on operational tech. Do you agree with this hot take, or have another perspective entirely?\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ. The same statement applies when it comes to human rights and socioeconomic issues, especially those who fall into under-represented groups. If you agree, what do you think we can do as a cybersecurity industry or community to help? If not, what do you think is the better mindset to have?\nA. The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying. We spend a lot of time talking about electrical power cybersecurity (and it’s definitely a cornerstone of functional society and safety), but that’s partially because that’s the only thing most of us have ever seen fail. In the US, most of us have never seen sewage not work for days, or long-term water cutoffs to our homes. That’s something we are just not equipped for.For underprivileged communities, the gap in resources for cybersecurity in municipal utilities is often even more pronounced. A key part of the battle is informed citizens and legislators recognizing all the places industrial systems keep our modern society working, and considering the implications of them failing or being tampered with. There’s been a lot of good community and governmental work towards closing this gap, but we have a long way to go.\n\n\n\nQ.

In reality, the solution comes back to prioritizing better foundational education for the next generation, and continuing that education through life.\n\n\n\nQ.  On the lighter side, what is something you’ve seen in our industry over the last year that may or may not be serious, but made you laugh, that we can all learn from?\nA. I get a chuckle every time somebody (almost daily) tells me they can’t decide what job they want to do in cybersecurity. Without fail, they all think they’re the only hacker interested in everything. Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices. People at DEF CON only talk about their cool days. Learn about the other ninety percent of their careers and what they dislike about their jobs. Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable. The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nA. Look, adversaries learn from one another, and they learn from the news just like we do. The last twenty years have demonstrated the reach and influence of digital industrial control systems. They are a critical part of everyday modern life in most of the world. Adversaries are also learning how dependent many verticals are on those systems to do jobs no longer staffed by humans (or previously functioning with much lower efficiency). That’s a big deal.While state-sponsored cyberattacks are driven by geopolitics, and those winds shift, we have to remain aware that the barrier to entry to industrial cyberattacks is lowering, and both criminals and nations now know that they can be devastating. Nations have spent over a decade building their capabilities and reconnaissance data to conduct serious attacks against control systems. There is more going on out there than most people are aware of. If cyberattacks are the most cost effective way to achieve an objective, they are going to be used to do so. And as more tools automate those complicated attacks, and more information about what works is available, they will be used more often by less sophisticated or resourced adversaries as well.Every country—including the U.S.—should be taking this threat very seriously as part of a defensive strategy for critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQ. The same statement applies when it comes to human rights and socioeconomic issues, especially those who fall into under-represented groups. If you agree, what do you think we can do as a cybersecurity industry or community to help? If not, what do you think is the better mindset to have?\nA. The economic divide in industrial systems is typically between verticals, and those verticals vary somewhat by country. For the most part, municipal utilities like water and sewage are much less resourced in cyber defense than, say, large oil and gas companies. Unfortunately, tampering or destruction of either of those verticals’ critical infrastructure devices can lead to people dying. We spend a lot of time talking about electrical power cybersecurity (and it’s definitely a cornerstone of functional society and safety), but that’s partially because that’s the only thing most of us have ever seen fail. In the US, most of us have never seen sewage not work for days, or long-term water cutoffs to our homes. That’s something we are just not equipped for.For underprivileged communities, the gap in resources for cybersecurity in municipal utilities is often even more pronounced. A key part of the battle is informed citizens and legislators recognizing all the places industrial systems keep our modern society working, and considering the implications of them failing or being tampered with. There’s been a lot of good community and governmental work towards closing this gap, but we have a long way to go.\n\n\n\nQ. Early last year you did a talk called “We’re All Scared, Too: 10 Years of Lessons from Cybersecurity Mentorship” for Wild West Hackin’ Fest. What was your biggest takeaway for that audience on the importance of mentorship?\nA. I do a lot of career mentorship through clinics and office hours, and the thing that’s really struck me is how many people have the exact same problems, but no idea they aren’t totally alone in them. In my talk, I spoke about some things I see weekly, like difficulty in choosing a cybersecurity niche, problems with toxic workplaces, the pressure to move to management from a technical role, and even burnout. They need a stranger like me to tell them it’s normal and okay, and help them tackle those problems. Sadly, I’m usually booked out for months because of the massive demand for mentorship. We need more senior people stepping up and taking on formal and organized mentorship roles. People need an outside ear and unbiased perspective.\n\n\n\nQ. I found a tweet from more than two years ago from you that said: “Hi, just a gentle nudge that it is pride month, and I’m very genuinely non-binary / trans, and that is a meaningful thing to me – not a fad. I very much admire you all’s support of women, who I share many experiences with and support too, but code switching is exhausting.” Do you feel as if, at least within our industry, less “code switching” is necessary and there is more outward, dedicated support for non-binary and/or trans people?\nA. In my personal experience, cybersecurity is much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce. We have a robust community and good social support groups. That said, queer people today are facing the same cultural backlash in IT as anywhere else in society. I work in a customer-facing role. I’m active in the media and as a professional speaker. Sometimes I have to appear unremarkable and inoffensive to the audience to get the job done, and it sucks. I don’t know what the right answer is. I’ll continue to do everything I can to make everyone welcome in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this interview was conducted, Lesley announced a move to Melbourne, Australia, and will continue acting as Technical Director of Incident Response for Dragos.\nQ. Speaking of “former Twitter,” have you fully made the move to BlueSky like so many others? In other words, where can people best find you now?\nA. I left Twitter two years ago for ethical reasons and I have not looked back. I’m active on LinkedIn, Mastodon (Jerry Bell’s infosec.exchange instance), Bluesky, Threads, and Instagram. I also have a YouTube and a blog. A plethora of ways to find me and keep in touch, should the reader wish to. I love making new pals!\n\n\n\nQ.  We’ve covered a lot of topics so far, from your career to the state of the world to the issues affecting humans. What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly. We are prioritizing the wrong things, and jumping ahead of the basics. We aren’t thinking adequately as a society about the long-term results of our choices.

I get a chuckle every time somebody (almost daily) tells me they can’t decide what job they want to do in cybersecurity. Without fail, they all think they’re the only hacker interested in everything. Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices. People at DEF CON only talk about their cool days. Learn about the other ninety percent of their careers and what they dislike about their jobs. Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable. The world is big.\n\n\n\nRelated: Wendy Nather on Resilience, Leadership, and Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community\nRelated: Alyssa Miller on ‘Do Better, be Better’ and ‘See Past the Technology’ to Advance Cybersecurity\nRelated:  Christien “DilDog” Rioux on Building Privacy and What Makes Hackers Unique\n\nA. I do a lot of career mentorship through clinics and office hours, and the thing that’s really struck me is how many people have the exact same problems, but no idea they aren’t totally alone in them. In my talk, I spoke about some things I see weekly, like difficulty in choosing a cybersecurity niche, problems with toxic workplaces, the pressure to move to management from a technical role, and even burnout. They need a stranger like me to tell them it’s normal and okay, and help them tackle those problems. Sadly, I’m usually booked out for months because of the massive demand for mentorship. We need more senior people stepping up and taking on formal and organized mentorship roles. People need an outside ear and unbiased perspective.\n\n\n\nQ. I found a tweet from more than two years ago from you that said: “Hi, just a gentle nudge that it is pride month, and I’m very genuinely non-binary / trans, and that is a meaningful thing to me – not a fad. I very much admire you all’s support of women, who I share many experiences with and support too, but code switching is exhausting.” Do you feel as if, at least within our industry, less “code switching” is necessary and there is more outward, dedicated support for non-binary and/or trans people?\nA. In my personal experience, cybersecurity is much better than a lot of IT fields in support for neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, and other non-traditional members of the workforce. We have a robust community and good social support groups. That said, queer people today are facing the same cultural backlash in IT as anywhere else in society. I work in a customer-facing role. I’m active in the media and as a professional speaker. Sometimes I have to appear unremarkable and inoffensive to the audience to get the job done, and it sucks. I don’t know what the right answer is. I’ll continue to do everything I can to make everyone welcome in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this interview was conducted, Lesley announced a move to Melbourne, Australia, and will continue acting as Technical Director of Incident Response for Dragos.\nQ. Speaking of “former Twitter,” have you fully made the move to BlueSky like so many others? In other words, where can people best find you now?\nA. I left Twitter two years ago for ethical reasons and I have not looked back. I’m active on LinkedIn, Mastodon (Jerry Bell’s infosec.exchange instance), Bluesky, Threads, and Instagram. I also have a YouTube and a blog. A plethora of ways to find me and keep in touch, should the reader wish to. I love making new pals!\n\n\n\nQ.  We’ve covered a lot of topics so far, from your career to the state of the world to the issues affecting humans. What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly.

Yes, we’re all interested in absolutely everything. Interest is not your daily work, though. Find the things you don’t want to do, and narrow down the choices. People at DEF CON only talk about their cool days. Learn about the other ninety percent of their careers and what they dislike about their jobs. Rule out things like travel, report writing, long periods of hyperfocus, or working with customers that you may not enjoy – or gravitate towards those roles if you enjoy them!\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best career advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. It wasn’t advice given verbally. I had the most amazing mentor—my first real cybersecurity mentor—early in my career. He was the sweetest, humblest, most hard-working person I may have ever known in the industry. I aspire to be half the person he was. He was like an extra parent in a big company where people could be easily lost, and he worked insane hours – sometimes arriving at 6AM and leaving at 7PM to shield us from bureaucracy. He would bring us food, happy meal toys, and dance in the hallway if we were down. We played video games on the weekends.\n\n\n\nHe passed away, suddenly, from an undiagnosed illness. He was a few years from retirement and had worked at the company for over 30 years. He had a wife who loved him who he barely saw during the week.\n\n\n\nI learned so much from him, and he made my working life infinitely better. At the same time, he was replaced by the company in a few weeks, and we had to appeal to get a small conference room named after him. I hope people in the future are still told who he was.\n\n\n\nYour work is not your family. You can love it, be passionate about it, and care about your employees. However, you are your one best advocate, and you should not go above and beyond perpetually to account for gaps in staffing or resources. You need to have your own life, outside work.\n\n\n\nQ.  What makes you the most humbled or proud?\nA. Every time a person I have mentored or taught reaches out months or years later to tell me they’ve been successful, and remembers how I helped them in a small way. It makes it worth it. Thank you.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, there are a lot of people who look up to you, who want to get to the level of impact in the world that you have had. What should they think about when they feel like they’ve hit a wall?\nA. Be true to yourself and find what you want out of life (and why). Find your people and your own things. Everybody else has their own agenda and biases when they make plans for you. Only you can know which of the million lives on this planet is right for you. You have more options than you know, even if some of them are scary or uncomfortable.

What worries you the most that we need to address, either in cyber or outside of it?\nA. What a huge question. If I had just one magical genie wish, I would improve critical thinking skills in humans around the world. That includes introspection about biases, gauging cause and effect, identifying disinformation, and threat modeling. Lack of good critical thinking skills are negatively impacting human society as a whole, and also impacting cybersecurity directly.

According to Gan, these investors are putting Cybereason at risk of bankruptcy by refusing to accept financing proposals in order to “preserve their control and financial advantages”. The accused investors have denied the accusations. Gan wants to raise $150 for the company. \n\n\n\nRussian cybercriminal released by US in prisoner swap\nAlexander Vinnik has been handed over by the US to Russia in exchange for Marc Fogel, a school teacher sentenced to 14 years in prison for drug trafficking charges. Vinnik is a Russian national charged and held in the US for operating BTC-e, a cryptocurrency exchange used by cybercriminals to launder illicit proceeds. Prior to being extradited to the US, he was sentenced to prison in France for money laundering. Vinnik’s sentencing in the US was scheduled for June. \n\n\n\nCISA and FBI warn of buffer overflow vulnerabilities \nCISA and the FBI have released another Secure-by-Design alert, urging software developers to take steps to eliminate buffer overflow vulnerabilities, which are often exploited by threat actors for initial access and lateral movement. \n\n\n\nGoogle pays $10,000 bug bounty for YouTube vulnerability\nA researcher has earned a $10,000 bug bounty from Google for responsibly disclosing a vulnerability that could have been exploited to obtain the email address associated with any YouTube account.

In late 2024, Arctic Wolf observed Akira ransomware affiliates targeting SSL VPN user accounts on SonicWall devices as an initial access vector,” the security firm notes.\n\n\n\nAccording to Bishop Fox, approximately 4,500 internet-facing SonicWall SSL VPN servers had not been patched against CVE-2024-53704 by February 7.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nOrganizations are advised to update their appliances as soon as possible, or to apply the mitigations described in SonicWall’s advisory, which has been updated to warn of the public PoC.\n\n\n\n“PoCs for the SonicOS SSLVPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2024-53704) are now publicly available. This significantly increases the risk of exploitation. Customers must immediately update all unpatched firewalls (7.1.x & 8.0.0).

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nChina-linked APT Salt Typhoon has been exploiting known vulnerabilities in Cisco devices in attacks on telecom providers in the US and abroad.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThe Chinese state-sponsored APT actor known as Salt Typhoon has been observed exploiting two known vulnerabilities in Cisco devices in recent attacks against telecommunications providers, Recorded Future reports.\nBelieved to be operated by China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) and tracked as Salt Typhoon, RedMike, Earth Estrie, FamousSparrow, and Ghost Emperor, the APT was blamed for last year’s hacking of nine US telecommunications companies and its members were sanctioned by the US.\n\n\n\nAccording to Recorded Future, despite public disclosure and sanctions, Salt Typhoon has continued to target telecom providers, as well as universities in multiple countries, exploiting vulnerable internet-facing devices for initial access.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, the group targeted Cisco switches and routers vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273, two critical issues in the IOS XE platform that were disclosed in October 2023, after they had been exploited as zero-days.\n\n\n\nSince early December 2024, “RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide,” likely using a list of devices associated with telecom providers’ networks, Recorded Future notes in a fresh report (PDF).\n\n\n\n“More than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries,” the cybersecurity firm says.\n\n\n\nRecorded Future identified targeted devices in the networks of telecom organizations in the US, South Africa, and Myanmar, as well as universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.\n\n\n\nKnown victims include the US-based affiliate of a UK telecoms provider, a US ISP and telecoms provider, South African and Thailand telecoms providers, an Italian ISP, UCLA, Utah Tech, Loyola Marymount University, California State University, Sebelas Maret and Negeri Malang universities, University of Malaya, and Technische Universiteit Delft.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThe APT exploited the flaws to create a privileged account on the vulnerable devices, which was then used to add a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel to obtain persistent access, bypass firewalls, and avoid detection when exfiltrating data.\n\n\n\nAccording to Recorded Future, there are over 12,000 Cisco network devices that have web UIs accessible from the internet, which suggests that Salt Typhoon’s activity was likely targeted, especially considering the APT’s focus on telecoms organizations.\n\n\n\n“Organizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes,” Recorded Future notes.\n\n\n\nRelated: Chinese Cyberspy Possibly Launching Ransomware Attacks as Side Job\nRelated: CISA Warns of Old jQuery Vulnerability Linked to Chinese APT\nRelated: FBI Tells Telecom Firms to Boost Security Following Chinese Hacking\nRelated: Japan Links Chinese Hacker MirrorFace to Dozens of Cyberattacks Targeting Security and Tech Data\n\nBelieved to be operated by China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) and tracked as Salt Typhoon, RedMike, Earth Estrie, FamousSparrow, and Ghost Emperor, the APT was blamed for last year’s hacking of nine US telecommunications companies and its members were sanctioned by the US.\n\n\n\nAccording to Recorded Future, despite public disclosure and sanctions, Salt Typhoon has continued to target telecom providers, as well as universities in multiple countries, exploiting vulnerable internet-facing devices for initial access.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, the group targeted Cisco switches and routers vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273, two critical issues in the IOS XE platform that were disclosed in October 2023, after they had been exploited as zero-days.\n\n\n\nSince early December 2024, “RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide,” likely using a list of devices associated with telecom providers’ networks, Recorded Future notes in a fresh report (PDF).\n\n\n\n“More than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India.
