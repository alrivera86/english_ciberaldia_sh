        "Content": "A new campaign is targeting companies in Taiwan with malware known as\nWinos 4.0\nas part of phishing emails masquerading as the country's National Taxation Bureau.\nThe campaign, detected last month by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, marks a departure from previous attack chains that have leveraged\nmalicious game-related applications\n.\n\"The sender claimed that the malicious file attached was a list of enterprises scheduled for tax inspection and asked the receiver to forward the information to their company's treasurer,\" security researcher Pei Han Liao\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe attachment mimics an official document from the Ministry of Finance, urging the recipient to download the list of enterprises scheduled for tax inspection.\nBut in reality, the list is a ZIP file containing a malicious DLL (\"lastbld2Base.dll\") that lays the groundwork for the next attack stage, leading to the execution of shellcode that's responsible for downloading a Winos 4.0 module from a remote server (\"206.238.221[.]60\") for gathering sensitive data.\nThe component, described as a login module, is capable of taking screenshots, logging keystrokes, altering clipboard content, monitoring connected USB devices, running shellcode, and permitting the execution of sensitive actions (e.g., cmd.exe) when security prompts from Kingsoft Security and Huorong are displayed.\nFortinet said it also observed a second attack chain that downloads an\nonline module\nthat can capture screenshots of WeChat and online banks.\nIt's worth noting that the\nintrusion set\ndistributing the Winos 4.0 malware has been assigned the monikers Void Arachne and Silver Fox, with the malware also overlapping with\nanother remote access trojan\ntracked as\nValleyRAT\n.\n\"They are both derived from the same source: Gh0st RAT, which was developed in China and open-sourced in 2008,\" Daniel dos Santos, Head of Security Research at Forescout's Vedere Labs, told The Hacker News.\n\"Winos and ValleyRAT are variations of Gh0st RAT attributed to Silver Fox by different researchers at different points in time. Winos was a name commonly used in 2023 and 2024 while now ValleyRAT is more commonly used. The tool is constantly evolving, and it has both local Trojan/RAT capabilities as well as a command-and-control server.\"\nValleyRAT\n, first identified in early 2023, has been recently observed using fake Chrome sites as a conduit to infect Chinese-speaking users. Similar drive-by download schemes have also been employed to deliver Gh0st RAT.\nFurthermore, Winos 4.0 attack chains have incorporated what's called a CleverSoar installer that's executed by means of an MSI installer package distributed as fake software or gaming-related applications. Also dropped alongside Winos 4.0 via CleverSoar is the open-source\nNidhogg\nrootkit.\n\"The CleverSoar installer [...] checks the user's language settings to verify if they are set to Chinese or Vietnamese,\" Rapid7\nnoted\nin late November 2024. \"If the language is not recognized, the installer terminates, effectively preventing infection. This behavior strongly suggests that the threat actor is primarily targeting victims in these regions.\"\nThe disclosure comes as the Silver Fox APT has been linked to a new campaign that leverages trojanized versions of Philips DICOM viewers to deploy ValleyRAT, which is then used to drop a keylogger, and a cryptocurrency miner on victim computers. Notably, the attacks have been found to use a vulnerable version of the\nTrueSight driver\nto disable antivirus software.\n\"This campaign leverages trojanized DICOM viewers as lures to infect victim systems with a backdoor (ValleyRAT) for remote access and control, a keylogger to capture user activity and credentials, and a crypto miner to exploit system resources for financial gain,\" Forescout\nsaid\n.\nFound this article interesting?

It's tracking the activity under the name Erudite Mogwai.\nThe attacks are also characterized by the use of other tools like\nDeed RAT\n, also called ShadowPad Light, and a customized version of\nproxy utility\nnamed\nStowaway\n, which has been previously used by other China-linked hacking groups.\n\"Erudite Mogwai is one of the active APT groups specializing in the theft of confidential information and espionage,\" Solar researchers\nsaid\n. \"Since at least 2017, the group has been attacking government agencies, IT departments of various organizations, as well as enterprises related to high-tech industries such as aerospace and electric power.\"\nThe threat actor was first\npublicly documented\nby Positive Technologies in 2022, detailing its exclusive use of the Deed RAT malware. The group is believed to share tactical overlaps with another hacking group called Webworm. It's known to target organizations in Russia, Georgia, and Mongolia.\nIn one of the attacks targeting a government sector customer, Solar said it discovered the attacker deploying various tools to facilitate reconnaissance, while also dropping LuckyStrike Agent, a multi-functional .NET backdoor that uses Microsoft OneDrive for command-and-control (C2).\n\"The attackers gained access to the infrastructure by compromising a publicly accessible web service no later than March 2023, and then began looking for 'low-hanging fruit' in the infrastructure,\" Solar said. \"Over the course of 19 months, the attackers slowly spread across the customer's systems until they reached the network segments connected to monitoring in November 2024.\"\nAlso noteworthy is the use of a modified version of Stowaway to retain only its proxy functionality, alongside using LZ4 as a compression algorithm, incorporating XXTEA as an encryption algorithm, and adding support for the\nQUIC\ntransport protocol.\n\"Erudite Mogwai began their journey in modifying this utility by cutting down the functionality they didn't need,\" Solar said. \"They continued with minor edits, such as renaming functions and changing the sizes of structures (probably to knock down existing detection signatures). At the moment, the version of Stowaway used by this group can be called a full-fledged fork.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Organizations are either already adopting GenAI solutions, evaluating strategies for integrating these tools into their business plans, or both. To drive informed decision-making and effective planning, the availability of hard data is essential—yet such data remains surprisingly scarce.\nThe “\nEnterprise GenAI Data Security Report 2025\n” by LayerX delivers unprecedented insights into the practical application of AI tools in the workplace, while highlighting critical vulnerabilities. Drawing on real-world telemetry from LayerX’s enterprise clients, this report is one of the few reliable sources that details actual employee use of GenAI.\nFor instance, it reveals that nearly 90% of enterprise AI usage occurs outside the visibility of IT, exposing organizations to significant risks such as data leakage and unauthorized access.\nBelow we bring some of the report’s key findings. Read the full report to refine and enhance your security strategies, leverage data-driven decision-making for risk management, and evangelize for resources to enhance GenAI data protection measures.\nTo register to a webinar that will cover the key findings in this report,\nclick here\n.\nUse of GenAI in the Enterprise is Casual at Most (for Now)\nWhile the GenAI hype may make it seem like the entire workforce has transitioned their office operations to GenAI, LayerX finds the actual use a tad more lukewarm. Approximately 15% of users access GenAI tools on a daily basis. This is not a percentage to be ignored, but it is not the majority.\nYet. Here at The New Stack we concur with LayerX’s analysis, predicting this trend will accelerate quickly. Especially since 50% of users currently use GenAI every other week.\nIn addition, they find that 39% of regular GenAI tool users are software developers, meaning that the highest potential of data leakage through GenAI is of source and proprietary code, as well as the risk of using risky code in your codebase.\nHow is GenAI Being Used? Who Knows?\nSince LayerX is situated in the browser, the tool has visibility into the use of Shadow SaaS. This means they can see employees using tools that were not approved by the organization’s IT or through non-corporate accounts.\nAnd while GenAI tools like ChatGPT are used for work purposes, nearly 72% of employees access them through their personal accounts. If employees do access through corporate accounts, only about 12% is done with SSO. As a result, nearly 90% of GenAI usage is invisible to the organization. This leaves organizations blind to ‘shadow AI’ applications and the unsanctioned sharing of corporate information on AI tools.\n50% of Pasting Activity intoGenAI Includes Corporate Data\nRemember the Pareto principle? In this case, while not all users use GenAI on a daily basis, users who do paste into GenAI applications, do so frequently and of potentially confidential information.\nLayerX found that pasting of corporate data occurs almost 4 times a day, on average, among users who submit data to GenAI tools. This could include business information, customer data, financial plans, source code, etc.\nHow to Plan for GenAI Usage: What Enterprises Must Do Now\nThe findings in the report signal an urgent need for new security strategies to manage GenAI risk. Traditional security tools fail to address the modern AI-driven workplace where applications are browser-based. They lack the ability to detect, control, and secure AI interactions at the source—the browser.\nBrowser-based security provides visibility into access to AI SaaS applications, unknown AI applications beyond ChatGOT, AI-enabled browser extensions, and more. This visibility can be used to employ DLP solutions for GenAI, allowing enterprises to safely include GenAI in their plans, future-proofing their business.\nTo access more data on how GenAI is being used, read the\nfull report\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have discovered an updated version of an Android malware called\nTgToxic\n(aka ToxicPanda), indicating that the threat actors behind it are continuously making changes in response to public reporting.\n\"The modifications seen in the TgToxic payloads reflect the actors' ongoing surveillance of open source intelligence and demonstrate their commitment to enhancing the malware's capabilities to improve security measures and keep researchers at bay,\" Intel 471\nsaid\nin a report published this week.\nTgToxic was\nfirst documented\nby Trend Micro in early 2023, describing it as a banking trojan capable of stealing credentials and funds from crypto wallets as well as bank and finance apps. It has been detected in the wild since at least July 2022, mainly focusing on mobile users in Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia.\nThen in November 2024, Italian online fraud prevention firm Cleafy\ndetailed\nan updated variant with wide-ranging data-gathering features, while also expanding its operational scope to include Italy, Portugal, Hong Kong, Spain, and Peru. The malware is assessed to be the work of a Chinese-speaking threat actor.\nIntel 471's latest analysis has found that the malware is distributed via dropper APK files likely via SMS messages or phishing websites. However, the exact delivery mechanism remains unknown.\nSome of the notable improvements include improved emulator detection capabilities and updates to the command-and-control (C2) URL generation mechanism, underscoring ongoing efforts to sidestep analysis efforts.\n\"The malware conducts a thorough evaluation of the device's hardware and system capabilities to detect emulation,\" Intel 471 said. \"The malware examines a set of device properties including brand, model, manufacturer and fingerprint values to identify discrepancies that are typical of emulated systems.\"\nAnother significant change is the shift from hard-coded C2 domains embedded within the malware's configuration to using forums such as the Atlassian community developer forum to create bogus profiles that include an encrypted string pointing to the actual C2 server.\nThe TgToxic APK is designed to randomly select one of the community forum URLs provided in the configuration, which serves as a\ndead drop resolver\nfor the C2 domain.\nThe technique offers several advantages, foremost being that it makes it easier for threat actors to change C2 servers by simply updating the community user profile to point to the new C2 domain without having to issue any updates to the malware itself.\n\"This method considerably extends the operational lifespan of malware samples, keeping them functional as long as the user profiles on these forums remain active,\" Intel 471 said.\nSubsequent iterations of TgToxic discovered in December 2024 go a step further, relying on a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to create new domain names for use as C2 servers. This makes the malware more resilient to disruption efforts as the DGA can be used to create several domain names, allowing the attackers to switch to a new domain even if some are taken down.\n\"TgToxic stands out as a highly sophisticated Android banking trojan due to its advanced anti-analysis techniques, including obfuscation, payload encryption, and anti-emulation mechanisms that evade detection by security tools,\" Approov CEO Ted Miracco said in a statement.\n\"Its use of dynamic command-and-control (C2) strategies, such as domain generation algorithms (DGA), and its automation capabilities enable it to hijack user interfaces, steal credentials, and perform unauthorized transactions with stealth and resilience against countermeasures.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A new malware campaign has been observed targeting edge devices from Cisco, ASUS, QNAP, and Synology to rope them into a botnet named PolarEdge since at least the end of 2023.\nFrench cybersecurity company Sekoia\nsaid\nit observed the unknown threat actors leveraging\nCVE-2023-20118\n(CVSS score: 6.5), a critical security flaw impacting Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers that could result in arbitrary command execution on susceptible devices.\nThe vulnerability remains unpatched due to the routers reaching end-of-life (EoL) status. As mitigations, Cisco recommended in early 2023 that the flaw be mitigated by disabling remote management and blocking access to ports 443 and 60443.\nIn the attack registered against Sekoia's honeypots, the vulnerability is said to have been used to deliver a previously undocumented implant, a TLS backdoor that incorporates the ability to listen for incoming client connections and execute commands.\nThe backdoor is launched by means of a shell script called \"q\" that's retrieved via FTP and run following a successful exploitation of the vulnerability. It comes with capabilities to -\nCleanup log files\nTerminate suspicious processes\nDownload a malicious payload named \"t.tar\" from 119.8.186[.]227\nExecute a binary named \"cipher_log\" extracted from the archive\nEstablish persistence by modifying a file named \"/etc/flash/etc/cipher.sh\" to run the \"cipher_log\" binary repeatedly\nExecute \"cipher_log,\" the TLS backdoor\nCodenamed PolarEdge, the malware enters into an infinite loop, establishing a TLS session as well as spawning a child process to manage client requests and execute commands using exec_command.\n\"The binary informs the C2 server that it has successfully infected a new device,\" Sekoia researchers Jeremy Scion and Felix Aimé said. \"The malware transmits this information to the reporting server, enabling the attacker to determine which device was infected through the IP address/port pairing.\"\nFurther analysis has uncovered similar PolarEdge payloads being used to target ASUS, QNAP, and Synology devices. All the artifacts were uploaded to VirusTotal by users located in Taiwan. The payloads are distributed via FTP using the IP address 119.8.186[.]227, which belongs to Huawei Cloud.\nIn all, the botnet is estimated to have compromised 2,017 unique IP addresses around the world, with most of the infections detected in the United States, Taiwan, Russia, India, Brazil, Australia, and Argentina.\n\"The purpose of this botnet has not yet been determined,\" the researchers noted. \"An objective of PolarEdge could be to control compromised edge devices, transforming them into Operational Relay Boxes for launching offensive cyber attacks.\"\n\"The botnet exploits multiple vulnerabilities across different types of equipment, highlighting its ability to target various systems. The complexity of the payloads further underscores the sophistication of the operation, suggesting that it is being conducted by skilled operators. This indicates that PolarEdge is a well-coordinated and substantial cyber threat.\"\nThe disclosure comes as SecurityScorecard revealed that a massive botnet comprising over 130,000 infected devices is being weaponized to conduct large-scale password-spraying attacks against Microsoft 365 (M365) accounts by exploiting\nnon-interactive sign-ins\nwith Basic Authentication.\nNon-interactive sign-ins are typically used for service-to-service authentication and legacy protocols like POP, IMAP, and SMTP. They do not trigger multi-factor authentication (MFA) in many configurations. Basic Authentication, on the other hand, allows credentials to be transmitted in plaintext format.\nThe activity, likely the work of a Chinese-affiliated group owing to the use of infrastructure tied to CDS Global Cloud and UCLOUD HK, employs stolen credentials from infostealer logs across a wide range of M365 accounts to obtain unauthorized access and get hold of sensitive data.\n\"This technique bypasses modern login protections and evades MFA enforcement, creating a critical blind spot for security teams,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"Attackers leverage stolen credentials from infostealer logs to systematically target accounts at scale.\"\n\"These attacks are recorded in non-interactive sign-in logs, which are often overlooked by security teams. Attackers exploit this gap to conduct high-volume password spraying attempts undetected. This tactic has been observed across multiple M365 tenants globally, indicating a widespread and ongoing threat.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Alternately, it has also been found to orchestrate job-themed social engineering campaigns that lead to the deployment of malicious npm packages.\nByBit, in the meanwhile, has\nlaunched a bounty program\nto help recover the stolen funds, while calling out eXch for refusing to cooperate in the probe and help freeze the assets.\n\"The stolen funds have been transferred to untraceable or freezeable destinations, such as exchanges, mixers, or bridges, or converted into stablecoins that can be frozen,\" it said. \"We require cooperation from all involved parties to either freeze the funds or provide updates on their movement so we can continue tracing.\"\nThe Dubai-based company has also\nshared\nthe conclusions of two investigations conducted by Sygnia and Verichains, linking the hack to the Lazarus Group.\n\"The forensics investigation of the three signers' hosts suggests the root cause of the attack is malicious code originating from Safe{Wallet}'s infrastructure,\" Sygnia said.\nVerichains noted that \"the benign JavaScript file of app.safe.global appears to have been replaced with malicious code on February 19, 2025, at 15:29:25 UTC, specifically targeting Ethereum Multisig Cold Wallet of Bybit,\" and that the \"attack was designed to activate during the next Bybit transaction, which occurred on February 21, 2025, at 14:13:35 UTC.\"\nIt's suspected that the AWS S3 or CloudFront account/API Key of Safe.Global was likely leaked or compromised, thereby paving the way for a supply chain attack.\nIn a separate statement, multisig wallet platform Safe{Wallet} said the attack was carried out by compromising one of its developer's machines which affected an account operated by Bybit. The company further noted that it implemented added security measures to mitigate the attack vector.\nThe attack \"was achieved through a compromised machine of a Safe{Wallet} developer resulting in the proposal of a disguised malicious transaction,\" it\nsaid\n. \"Lazarus is a state-sponsored North Korean hacker group that is well known for sophisticated social engineering attacks on developer credentials, sometimes combined with zero-day exploits.\"\nIt's currently not clear how the developer's system was breached, although a new analysis from Silent Push has uncovered that the Lazarus Group registered the domain bybit-assessment[.]com at 22:21:57 on February 20, 2025, a few hours before the cryptocurrency theft took place.\nWHOIS records\nshow\nthat the domain was registered using the email address \"trevorgreer9312@gmail[.]com,\" which has been previously identified as a persona used by the Lazarus Group in\nconnection\nwith\nanother campaign\ndubbed Contagious Interview.\n\"It appears the Bybit heist was conducted by the DPRK threat actor group known as TraderTraitor, also known as Jade Sleet and Slow Pisces – whereas the crypto interview scam is being led by a DPRK threat actor group known as\nContagious Interview\n, also known as Famous Chollima,\" the company\nsaid\n.\n\"Victims are typically approached via LinkedIn, where they are socially engineered into participating in fake job interviews.

        "Content": "Privacy-focused email provider Tuta (previously Tutanota) and the VPN Trust Initiative (VTI) are raising concerns over proposed laws in France set to backdoor encrypted messaging systems and restrict internet access.\nThe first case concerns a proposed amendment to France's \"Narcotrafic\" law, which would compel providers of encrypted communication services to implement backdoors, enabling law enforcement to access decrypted messages of suspected criminals within 72 hours of a request.\nNon-compliance could result in substantial fines: €1.5 million for individuals and up to 2% of annual global turnover for companies.\nThe law has not yet been put into effect, but the amendment has already passed the French Senate and is advancing to the National Assembly, so mounting opposition is crucial.\nIn a\nnew statement\n, Tuta urges the French National Assembly to reject this amendment, advocating for the preservation of robust encryption to protect individual privacy and security.\nThey stressed once again that mandating backdoors in software undermines the security and privacy of all users, not just criminals, as it creates vulnerabilities exploitable by malicious actors.\n\"A backdoor for the good guys only is a dangerous illusion,\" Tuta Mail's CEO, Matthias Pfau, told BleepingComputer.\n\"Weakening encryption for law enforcement inevitably creates vulnerabilities that can – and will – be exploited by cybercriminals and hostile foreign actors. This law would not just target criminals, it would destroy security for everyone.\"\nTuta goes a step further to note the legal complexities that arise from the proposed amendment, as it reportedly opposes Europe's GDPR and also Germany's IT security laws.\nVPNs object access restrictions\nEarlier this week, VTI issued a strong statement on a law amendment in France driven by rightsholders Canal+ and the French Football League (LFP), who have initiated legal actions to compel VPN providers to block access to pirate sites and services.\nVTI, whose members include AWS, Google, Cloudflare, Namecheap, OVH, IPVanish VPN, Ivacy VPN, NordVPN, PureVPN, and ExpressVPN, sees this as wrongful targeting of VPN services and urges French authorities to reconsider their approach.\n\"Focusing on content-neutral tools like VPNs rather than addressing the sources of illegal content not only fails to combat piracy but creates and inflicts collateral damage to cybersecurity and privacy, putting users at risk,\"\nstated VTI\n.\nIn the letter it posted on its website, the VTI draws parallels with overly aggressive internet blocking laws in China, Russia, Myanmar, and Iran, characterizing the proposal as a potential \"weapon for censorship.\"\nGovt pressure mounting\nThe latest news about sweeping law proposals in France confirms a rising trend of government action aimed at imposing closer control and monitoring of data flows over the internet.\nLast week,\nApple decided to pull\nits iCloud end-to-end encryption feature, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), from the UK following a secret order from the government demanding the creation of a backdoor to access user data.\nA similar law proposed in Sweden is poised to grant law enforcement agencies access to users' message history from apps like Signal. However, Signal's President\nMeredith Whittaker said\nin a recent interview that this law would force them to pull their service out of the country.\nRelated Articles:\nStealthy 'Magic Packet' malware targets Juniper VPN gateways\nSuspected Desorden hacker arrested for breaching 90 organizations\nNew Auto-Color Linux backdoor targets North American govts, universities\nAustralia bans all Kaspersky products on government systems\nUS healthcare org pays $11M settlement over alleged cybersecurity lapses"

        "Content": "Microsoft has named multiple threat actors part of a cybercrime gang accused of developing malicious tools capable of bypassing generative AI guardrails to generate celebrity deepfakes and other illicit content.\nAn\nupdated complaint\nidentifies the individuals as Arian Yadegarnia from Iran (aka 'Fiz'), Alan Krysiak of the United Kingdom (aka 'Drago'), Ricky Yuen from Hong Kong, China (aka 'cg-dot'), and Phát Phùng Tấn of Vietnam (aka 'Asakuri').\nAs the company explained today, these threat actors are key members of a global cybercrime gang that it tracks as Storm-2139.\n\"Members of Storm-2139 exploited exposed customer credentials scraped from public sources to unlawfully access accounts with certain generative AI services,\"\nsaid Steven Masada\n, Assistant General Counsel at Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit.\n\"They then altered the capabilities of these services and resold access to other malicious actors, providing detailed instructions on how to generate harmful and illicit content, including non-consensual intimate images of celebrities and other sexually explicit content.\"\nMicrosoft found during the investigation that the Storm-2139 crime network is organized into three categories: creators, providers, and users.\nCreators developed the tools that facilitated the misuse of AI-generated services, while providers adapted and distributed these illicit tools to end users who employed them to generate content violating Microsoft's\nAcceptable Use Policy\nand\nCode of Conduct\n, which was frequently focused on sexual imagery and celebrities.\nStorm-2139 organizational chart (Microsoft)\n​Today's update follows the\ncompany's lawsuit filed\nin the Eastern District of Virginia in December 2024 to collect more information on the cybercrime ring's operations.\nA temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction issued after the initial filing allowed Microsoft to disrupt the group's ability to use its services illegally by seizing a key website part of the criminal ring's infrastructure.\nMicrosoft added that the seizure caused Storm-2139 members to turn on each other and speculate about who the \"John Does\" in the filings were. Microsoft's legal team also received multiple emails, including from several suspected members of Storm-2139 who blamed others in the operation for the malicious activity.\n\"We are pursuing this legal action now against identified defendants to stop their conduct, to continue to dismantle their illicit operation, and to deter others intent on weaponizing our AI technology,\" Masada added today.\n\"While we have identified two actors located in the United States—specifically, in Illinois and Florida—those identities remain undisclosed to avoid interfering with potential criminal investigations. Microsoft is preparing criminal referrals to United States and foreign law enforcement representatives. \"\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft raises rewards for Copilot AI bug bounty program\nGoogle says hackers abuse Gemini AI to empower their attacks\nMicrosoft tests Edge Scareware Blocker to block tech support scams\nSuspected Desorden hacker arrested for breaching 90 organizations\nVSCode extensions with 9 million installs pulled over security risks"

In the U.S., Modat found 1,966 exposed AMS systems.\nLocation of exposed AMS devices\nSource: Modat\nMitigating the problem\nThe researchers contacted all system owners directly to inform them of the AMS exposure and the risks this entails to their organizations. However, they told BleepingComputer they have not heard back yet, so it is unclear how many acted to secure their systems.\nVendors were also contacted, and some responded that they are working with impacted clients to fix the exposure.\nModat provided several security recommendations for AMS users, including taking their systems offline to prevent unauthorized remote access or placing them behind firewalls and VPNs to restrict access only to authorized personnel.\nIt is also recommended that the default admin credentials be changed as those are easy to brute-force, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be implemented if the option is available.\nAMS admins should apply their vendors' latest software and firmware updates and reduce unnecessary network services that may increase the attack surface.\nBiometric data and PII should always be stored in encrypted form, and data of past employees should be purged to avoid unauthorized access via old accounts that haven't been disabled on other systems.\nRelated Articles:\nCasio says data of 8,500 people exposed in October ransomware attack\nUS drug testing firm DISA says data breach impacts 3.3 million people\nOrange Group confirms breach after hacker leaks company documents\nCompliance Isn’t Security: Why a Checklist Won’t Stop Cyberattacks\nAustralian fertility services giant Genea hit by security breach"

        "Date": "2025-02-27",
        "Content": "​The Belgian federal prosecutor's office is investigating whether Chinese hackers were behind a breach of the country's State Security Service (VSSE).\nChinese state-backed attackers reportedly gained access to VSSE's external email server between 2021 and May 2023, siphoning around 10% of all emails sent and received by the agency's staff.\nThe compromised server was only used for exchanging emails with public prosecutors, government ministries, law enforcement, and other public Belgian administration bodies, as Belgian news outlet Le Soir\nreported\non Wednesday.\nAccording to\nThe Brussels Times\n, the hacked server also routed internal HR exchanges among Belgian intelligence personnel, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive personal data including identity documents and CVs belonging to nearly half of the VSSE's current staff and past applicants.\nBelgian local media first\nreported\nan attack on the VSSE in 2023, coinciding with Barracuda's vulnerability disclosure. Following this, the Belgian intelligence service stopped using Barracuda as a cybersecurity provider and advised affected staff to renew identification documents to mitigate the risk of identity fraud.\nHowever, there is currently no evidence of stolen data appearing on the dark web or ransom demands, and anonymous sources indicate that VSSE's security team monitors dark web hacking forums and marketplaces for leaked information.\n\"The timing of the attack was especially unfortunate, as we were in the midst of a major recruitment drive following the previous government's decision to almost double our workforce,\" an anonymous intelligence source told Le Soir. \"We thought we had bought a bulletproof vest, only to find a gaping hole in it.\"\nThe VSSE has remained silent on the issue, only noting that a formal complaint was submitted, per Brussels Times's report. At the same time, the federal prosecutor's office confirmed that a judicial investigation started in November 2023 but stressed that it's too early to draw any conclusions.\nThis isn't the first time Chinese state hackers targeted Belgium. In July 2022, the country's Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the\nAPT27\n,\nAPT30\n,\nAPT31\n, and\nGallium\n(aka Softcell and UNSC 2814) Chinese state-backed threat groups attacked Belgium's defense and interior ministries.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Belgium denied the accusations and pointed to a lack of evidence to sustain the Belgian government's claims.\n\"It is extremely unserious and irresponsible of the Belgian side to issue a statement about the so-called 'malicious cyberattacks' by Chinese hackers without any evidence,\" the Chinese embassy spokesperson\nsaid\n.\nBreach linked to Barracuda ESG zero-day\nVSSE's server was likely\nbreached using a zero-day vulnerability\nin Barracuda's Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliance.\nIn May 2023,\nBarracuda warned\nthat attackers had been using custom-tailored Saltwater, SeaSpy, Sandbar, and SeaSide malware in data-theft attacks\nsince at least October 2022\n, urging customers to\nimmediately replace compromised appliances\n.\nSubsequently, CISA revealed that it found new\nSubmarine\n(aka DepthCharge) and\nWhirlpool\nmalware used to backdoor Barracuda ESG appliances on U.S. federal agencies' networks.\nAt the same time, cybersecurity company Mandiant\nlinked the attacks\nto UNC4841, a hacking group known for cyber espionage attacks in support of the People's Republic of China.\nMandiant also found that the suspected Chinese hackers disproportionately\ntargeted and breached government and government-linked organizations\nworldwide in these attacks.\nIn December 2023, Barracuda\nwarned of another ESG zero-day vulnerability\nexploited in a second wave of attacks by the UNC4841 Chinese hackers.\nUpdate February 27, 15:08 EST:\nA Barracuda spokesperson shared the following statement after publishing time:\n\"Exploitation of the vulnerability impacting less than five percent of Email Security Gateway appliances took place in 2023 – not 2021. Our investigation data confirms that the vulnerability was not exploited in 2021.\nBarracuda promptly remediated the issue, which was fixed as part of the BNSF-36456 patch and applied to all customer appliances.

Instead, he notified the media or personal data protection regulators, with the aim of inflicting greater reputational and financial damage on his victims.\"\nThe hacker also resorted to emailing his victims' customers and, in rare cases, even encrypted the compromised firm's databases.\nOne notable case from when the hacker operated under the 'Desorden' persona is the hack and data theft on\nTaiwanese computer giant Acer\n.\nTimeline of activity\nSource: Group-IB\nTo breach corporate networks, the cybercriminal used 'sqlmap' for SQL injection attacks and exploited vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers to drop CobaltStrike beacons in the victim's environment.\nCobaltStrike is a legitimate but broadly abused penetration testing suite, with cracked versions used by cybercriminals to conduct malicious activities in breached environments.\nDespite the large number of breaches, Group-IB says the hacker did not perform significant lateral movement, instead focusing on quick data exfiltration onto cloud servers and victim extortion.\nThe Thai Police's raid on the hacker's premises resulted in the confiscation of multiple items, including laptops and luxury goods believed to have been purchased with cybercrime proceeds.\nImage from the police operation\nSource: Group-IB\nThai news outlet\nThe Nation reports\nthat the suspect is a 39-year-old man named Chia, who was arrested yesterday in Bangkok.\nAccording to the same outlet, Chia has already admitted his guilt, claiming that he worked alone, selling stolen data to buyers for $10,000.\nThe suspect now faces multiple charges, including unauthorized access to protected computer systems and data, attempted extortion, and illegal residence.\nRelated Articles:\nPolice arrests 2 Phobos ransomware suspects, seizes 8Base sites\nUS indicts Snowflake hackers who extorted $2.5 million from 3 victims\nOrange Group confirms breach after hacker leaks company documents\nSky ECC encrypted service distributors arrested in Spain, Netherlands\nSpain arrests suspected hacker of US and Spanish military agencies"

        "Content": "A U.S. Army soldier who pleaded guilty last week to leaking phone records for high-ranking U.S. government officials searched online for non-extradition countries and for an answer to the question “can hacking be treason?” prosecutors in the case said Wednesday. The government disclosed the details in a court motion to keep the defendant in custody until he is discharged from the military.\nOne of several selfies on the Facebook page of Cameron Wagenius.\nCameron John Wagenius, 20, was arrested near the Army base in Fort Cavazos, Texas on Dec. 20, and charged with two criminal counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records. Wagenius was a communications specialist at a U.S. Army base in South Korea, who secretly went by the nickname Kiberphant0m and was part of a trio of criminal hackers that extorted dozens of companies last year over stolen data.\nAt the end of 2023, malicious hackers learned that many companies had uploaded sensitive customer records to accounts at the cloud data storage service Snowflake that were protected with little more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). After scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories used by some of the world’s largest corporations.\nAmong those was AT&T, which disclosed in July that cybercriminals had stolen personal information and phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people — nearly all of its customers. AT&T reportedly paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records. More than 160 other Snowflake customers were relieved of data, including TicketMaster, Lending Tree, Advance Auto Parts and Neiman Marcus.\nIn several posts to an English-language cybercrime forum in November, Kiberphant0m leaked some of the phone records and threatened to leak them all unless paid a ransom. Prosecutors said that in addition to his public posts on the forum, Wagenius had engaged in multiple direct attempts to extort “Victim-1,” which appears to be a reference to AT&T. The government states that Kiberphant0m privately demanded $500,000 from Victim-1, threatening to release all of the stolen phone records unless he was paid.\nOn Feb. 19, Wagenius pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully transferring confidential phone records, but he did so without the benefit of a plea agreement. In entering the plea, Wagenius’s attorneys had asked the court to allow him to stay with his father pending his sentencing.\nBut in a response filed today (PDF), prosecutors in Seattle said Wagenius was a flight risk, partly because prior to his arrest he was searching online for how to defect to countries that do not extradite to the United States. According to the government, while Kiberphant0m was extorting AT&T, Wagenius’s searches included:\n-“where can i defect the u.s government military which country will not hand me over”\n-“U.S. military personnel defecting to Russia”\n-“Embassy of Russia – Washington, D.C.”\n“As discussed in the government’s sealed filing, the government has uncovered evidence suggesting that the charged conduct was only a small part of Wagenius’ malicious activity,” the government memo states. “On top of this, for more than two weeks in November 2024, Wagenius communicated with an email address he believed belonged to Country-1’s military intelligence service in an attempt to sell stolen information. Days after he apparently finished communicating with Country-1’s military intelligence service, Wagenius Googled, ‘can hacking be treason.'”\nProsecutors told the court investigators also found a screenshot on Wagenius’ laptop that suggested he had over 17,000 files that included passports, driver’s licenses, and other identity cards belonging to victims of a breach, and that in one of his online accounts, the government also found a fake identification document that contained his picture.\n“Wagenius should also be detained because he presents a serious risk of flight, has the means and intent to flee, and is aware that he will likely face additional charges,” the Seattle prosecutors asserted.\nThe court filing says Wagenius is presently in the process of being separated from the Army, but the government has not received confirmation that his discharge has been finalized.\n“The government’s understanding is that, until his discharge from the Army is finalized (which is expected to happen in early March), he may only be released directly to the Army,” reads a footnote in the memo. “Until that process is completed, Wagenius’ proposed release to his father should be rejected for this additional reason.”\nWagenius’s interest in defecting to another country in order to escape prosecution mirrors that of his alleged co-conspirator, John Erin Binns, an 25-year-old elusive American man indicted by the Justice Department for a 2021 breach at T-Mobile that exposed the personal information of at least 76.6 million customers.\nBinns has since been charged with the Snowflake hack and subsequent extortion activity. He is currently in custody in a Turkish prison. Sources close to the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity that prior to his arrest by Turkish police, Binns visited the Russian embassy in Turkey to inquire about Russian citizenship.\nIn late November 2024, Canadian authorities arrested a third alleged member of the extortion conspiracy, 25-year-old Connor Riley Moucka of Kitchener, Ontario. The U.S. government has indicted Moucka and Binns, charging them with one count of conspiracy; 10 counts of wire fraud; four counts of computer fraud and abuse; two counts of extortion in relation to computer fraud; and two counts aggravated identity theft.\nLess than a month before Wagenius’s arrest, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive into Kiberphant0m’s various Telegram and Discord identities over the years, revealing how the owner of the accounts told others they were in the Army and stationed in South Korea.\nThe maximum penalty Wagenius could face at sentencing includes up to ten years in prison for each count, and fines not to exceed $250,000.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Wednesday 26th of February 2025 10:39 PM \r\n         \nThe fact he hasn’t been held in custody and later bought a laptop doesn’t give much hope. Do governments seriously think “orders” like “you may not purchase any electronic device” mean anything to these people? U.K found out the hard way when that kid was hacking companies through a fire stick in a hotel room while under police protection AND multiple arrests.\nWagenius is No Genius.\nYour email address will not be published.

This breakout time is important because that is how much time defenders have to detect and respond to an attack before the hackers start establishing deeper control. \n\n\n\nIn 2024, the average breakout time in the case of cybercrime intrusions dropped to 48 minutes, from 62 minutes in 2023, and the fastest breakout seen by CrowdStrike last year was just 51 seconds.\n\n\n\nOver half of the vulnerabilities seen by CrowdStrike last year were related to initial access, which the company says reinforces the need to secure exposed systems. It also noted that identity-based attacks are increasingly favored over traditional malware attacks. \n\n\n\nAccess broker activity surged in 2024, increasing by 50% compared to the previous year, and valid credential abuse was involved in 35% of cloud incidents.\n\n\n\nThe security firm found that 79% of the detections in 2024 were free of malware, which is a significant increase compared to five years ago, when only 40% of detections were malware-free.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThe company also found that vishing attacks “skyrocketed”, increasing by 442% between the first and second half of the year. \n\n\n\n“As adversaries scale identity-based attacks and vulnerability exploitation, organizations must adopt proactive defense strategies, including identity verification, risk-based patching, and early detection of credential abuse, to disrupt adversary operations before they escalate,” CrowdStrike recommends. \n\n\n\nThe full CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report is available in PDF format.\n\n\n\nRelated: WEF Report Reveals Growing Cyber Resilience Divide Between Public and Private Sectors\nRelated: China Targeted Foreign Investment, Sanctions Offices in Treasury Hack\nRelated: Cybersecurity Funding Reached $9.5 Billion in 2024\n\nThe cybersecurity giant started tracking 26 new threat groups in 2024, which brought the total number of adversaries known by the company to 257. \n\n\n\nCrowdStrike pointed out that China-linked activity surged, with a 150% increase seen across all sectors, and a rise of 200-300% in industries such as financial services, media, manufacturing, and industrials and engineering compared to 2023. \n\n\n\nOne interesting aspect that CrowdStrike has been tracking is breakout time, the time it takes threat actors to move from initial access to high-value assets.

The security firm is aware of more than 90 data leaks impacting organizations around the world. While a majority of his victims were organizations in the APAC region — he has been described as one of the most active cybercriminals in this region — he has also targeted companies in North America and Europe. \n\n\n\nVictims included organizations in sectors such as healthcare, finance, retail, property investment, hospitality, e-commerce, technology, logistics, and insurance.\n\n\n\nThe hacker exfiltrated sensitive data from the targeted organization’s databases, and then attempted to convince the victim to pay a ransom to avoid having the data made public. Advertisement.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nThe current state of regulation and the overwhelming burden it brings to most enterprises is a discussion worth having\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nMy favorite part of my job is spending time with customers discussing their pain points, challenges, goals, and priorities. These discussions are most often enriching, fascinating, and mutually beneficial. As you might imagine, different customers have different topics that interest them, drive them, and that they are passionate about.\nOne topic that comes up repeatedly, especially in the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) vertical is that of regulatory compliance and audit. Now, you might think that this is not particularly surprising, given that BFSI is one of the more tightly regulated verticals. What might be a bit surprising, however, is one particular pain point that customers in this vertical bring up repeatedly.\n\n\n\nWhat is this mysterious pain point? I’m not sure if it has an official name or not, but many people I meet with share with me that they are spending so much time responding to regulatory findings that they hardly have time for anything else. This is troubling to say the least. It may be an uncomfortable discussion to have, but I’d argue that it is long since past the time we as a security community have this discussion.\n\n\n\nFirst off, let’s take a look at why we find ourselves in this situation. There are likely many reasons why, but here are just a few of them:\n\n\n\n\nUnintended Consequences: While the intentions of different regulations might be noble and good, those noble and good intentions are almost always overshadowed by a fair number of unintended consequences. I’ll discuss some of those in the next section of this article.\nRigidity: Regulations are, most often, quite rigid. There isn’t generally a lot of space given to enterprises to get creative when looking to solve security problems. I understand that regulations need to set up firm boundaries, rules, and guidance. At the same time, however, it is important to remember that not every enterprise is the same and that there can be more than one way to accomplish a set of desired goals.  I think that for regulations to be effective, regulatory agencies need to make them more flexible and adaptable to real-world scenarios – a more pragmatic approach, if you will.\nLack of Timeliness: The threats enterprises face change and evolve quickly – even rapidly I might say.  Regulations often have trouble keeping up with the pace of that change. This means that enterprises are often forced to solve last year’s or even last decade’s problems, rather than the problems that might actually pose a far greater threat to the enterprise. In my opinion, regulatory agencies need to move more quickly to keep pace with the changing threat landscape.\nLack of Agility: Regulations are often produced by large, bureaucratic bodies that do not move particularly quickly.  This means that if some part of the regulation is ineffective, overly burdensome, impractical, or otherwise needs adjusting, it may take some time before this change happens.  In the interim, enterprises have no choice but to comply with something that the regulatory body has already acknowledged needs adjusting. It seems to me that more effective regulation can only happen when additional agility is introduced.\nSubjectivity: Ideally, regulatory findings would be entirely objective. Unfortunately, in practice, a lot depends on the auditor. There is far more subjectivity in the regulatory compliance exercise than there should be.  This is unfortunate and does no one a service. I would think that ensuring more objectivity in the regulatory process should be a priority for regulatory agencies.\n\nAs promised above, what are some of the unintended consequences of this situation?\n\n\n\n\nBurdensome: Enterprises generally find regulations burdensome. Most enterprises are quite happy to follow guidance that improves their security postures.  Unfortunately, that is not the reality of the situation with most regulations.\nTime Sink: Sadly, compliance has become a huge time sink for most enterprises.  A tremendous amount of people, money, and time are dedicated to satisfying various regulatory requirements.  Generally, far more resources than one might reasonably expect an enterprise to devote to this purpose.\nCheckbox Approach: Perhaps the worst of the unintended consequences is that most enterprises are forced to take a checkbox approach to compliance.  Whereas in theory, regulations have the potential to bring about real changes and significant improvements, in practice, they bring about a checkbox approach to security.\nFire Fighting: When there is a regulatory finding, enterprises are forced to shift into fire fighting mode.  This means that other initiatives, no matter how important or strategic they are, need to be put on the back burner.  After all, there are a limited number of resources available to address the multiple tasks at hand.\nDeteriorating Security Posture: The travesty in all of the above is that it often works against the security interests of the enterprise.  In other words, rather than being able to prioritize efforts that would improve the enterprise’s security posture, those efforts are de-prioritized in a constant juggling effort.  This most often results in a deteriorating security posture for the enterprise, which is exactly the opposite of the desired outcome of the regulation.\n\nI understand that this piece might bring some discomfort and awkwardness with it. That being said, I think that the current state of regulation and the overwhelming burden it brings to most enterprises is a discussion worth having. Perhaps with some discussion and fresh thinking, regulations and the regulatory bodies that produce them can be made more flexible, timely, agile, and objective.  Otherwise, we run the risk of causing enterprises to continue to place their security postures on the back burner while they deal with one regulatory finding after another. I’m not sure I see another way to improve the state of regulatory compliance other than reforming the regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Cybersecurity Regulatory Mayhem\n\n\nOne topic that comes up repeatedly, especially in the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) vertical is that of regulatory compliance and audit. Now, you might think that this is not particularly surprising, given that BFSI is one of the more tightly regulated verticals. What might be a bit surprising, however, is one particular pain point that customers in this vertical bring up repeatedly.\n\n\n\nWhat is this mysterious pain point? I’m not sure if it has an official name or not, but many people I meet with share with me that they are spending so much time responding to regulatory findings that they hardly have time for anything else. This is troubling to say the least. It may be an uncomfortable discussion to have, but I’d argue that it is long since past the time we as a security community have this discussion.\n\n\n\nFirst off, let’s take a look at why we find ourselves in this situation. There are likely many reasons why, but here are just a few of them:\n\n\n\n\nUnintended Consequences: While the intentions of different regulations might be noble and good, those noble and good intentions are almost always overshadowed by a fair number of unintended consequences. I’ll discuss some of those in the next section of this article.\nRigidity: Regulations are, most often, quite rigid. There isn’t generally a lot of space given to enterprises to get creative when looking to solve security problems. I understand that regulations need to set up firm boundaries, rules, and guidance. At the same time, however, it is important to remember that not every enterprise is the same and that there can be more than one way to accomplish a set of desired goals.  I think that for regulations to be effective, regulatory agencies need to make them more flexible and adaptable to real-world scenarios – a more pragmatic approach, if you will.\nLack of Timeliness: The threats enterprises face change and evolve quickly – even rapidly I might say.  Regulations often have trouble keeping up with the pace of that change.

This means that enterprises are often forced to solve last year’s or even last decade’s problems, rather than the problems that might actually pose a far greater threat to the enterprise. In my opinion, regulatory agencies need to move more quickly to keep pace with the changing threat landscape.\nLack of Agility: Regulations are often produced by large, bureaucratic bodies that do not move particularly quickly.  This means that if some part of the regulation is ineffective, overly burdensome, impractical, or otherwise needs adjusting, it may take some time before this change happens.  In the interim, enterprises have no choice but to comply with something that the regulatory body has already acknowledged needs adjusting. It seems to me that more effective regulation can only happen when additional agility is introduced.\nSubjectivity: Ideally, regulatory findings would be entirely objective. Unfortunately, in practice, a lot depends on the auditor. There is far more subjectivity in the regulatory compliance exercise than there should be.  This is unfortunate and does no one a service. I would think that ensuring more objectivity in the regulatory process should be a priority for regulatory agencies.\n\nAs promised above, what are some of the unintended consequences of this situation?\n\n\n\n\nBurdensome: Enterprises generally find regulations burdensome. Most enterprises are quite happy to follow guidance that improves their security postures.  Unfortunately, that is not the reality of the situation with most regulations.\nTime Sink: Sadly, compliance has become a huge time sink for most enterprises.  A tremendous amount of people, money, and time are dedicated to satisfying various regulatory requirements.  Generally, far more resources than one might reasonably expect an enterprise to devote to this purpose.\nCheckbox Approach: Perhaps the worst of the unintended consequences is that most enterprises are forced to take a checkbox approach to compliance.  Whereas in theory, regulations have the potential to bring about real changes and significant improvements, in practice, they bring about a checkbox approach to security.\nFire Fighting: When there is a regulatory finding, enterprises are forced to shift into fire fighting mode.  This means that other initiatives, no matter how important or strategic they are, need to be put on the back burner.  After all, there are a limited number of resources available to address the multiple tasks at hand.\nDeteriorating Security Posture: The travesty in all of the above is that it often works against the security interests of the enterprise.  In other words, rather than being able to prioritize efforts that would improve the enterprise’s security posture, those efforts are de-prioritized in a constant juggling effort.  This most often results in a deteriorating security posture for the enterprise, which is exactly the opposite of the desired outcome of the regulation.\n\nI understand that this piece might bring some discomfort and awkwardness with it.

This software is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that has been exploited to lead users to shady websites promoting adult content, diets, hacking services, and online casinos. \n\n\n\nKrpano is a widely used framework for panoramic images, enabling the creation of virtual tours and VR environments. \n\n\n\nThe XSS vulnerability, found in a library that is present on websites using the Krpano software, has allowed a threat actor to redirect users from pages hosted on those sites to arbitrary domains. The attackers used SEO poisoning to lure users to the pages hosting the malicious redirects. \n\n\n\nZaytsev identified — based on Google searches — more than 350 websites exploited by this threat actor, including sites belonging to government organizations, major universities, hotel chains, car dealerships, news outlets, and Fortune 500 companies. \n\n\n\n“Most of these sites were very popular and are having millions of visitors each month, and some had been hit multiple times, serving different types of ads,” the researcher said. \n\n\n\nIn some cases, the attackers did not redirect users to third-party websites and instead managed to embed their shady ads directly on the impacted site to make them more credible. One example is a CNN page, in which the hackers managed to directly embed casino ads. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nAn investigation by Zaytsev showed that the existence of the vulnerability has been known since 2020, when it was assigned CVE-2020-24901. Krpano developers implemented some restrictions at the time to prevent XSS attacks, but the patch was incomplete and the impact of the flaw was downplayed at the time. \n\n\n\nThe researcher has notified Krpano developers about the exploitation of the vulnerability and they implemented measures to prevent abuse with the release of version 1.22.4 on February 24. \n\n\n\nSecurityWeek has reached out to Krpano for comment and will update this article if the company responds. \n\n\n\nZaytsev attempted to directly notify many of the impacted organizations, but in many cases he did not manage to get through to anyone. In some cases, the affected organization did take steps to address the issue. \n\n\n\nUpdate: Krpano developer Klaus Reinfeld has provided several important clarifications for SecurityWeek:\n\n\n\n“I was very recently contacted by Oleg Zaytsev about the possibility that Data-URLs could be still used to inject something if the ‘xml’ parameter was explicitly allowed to pass by query (a very rare and not typically case). Loading xml files from external sources was already blocked in previous releases, so this was basically the last open security issue (for rare cases, but still).\nAs soon as I have heard about that problem, I had instantly fixed it and added also additional improvements to avoid other more theoretical injecting cases (e.g. if someone could upload files to the same server and then been able to redirect to these files).\nThe new version 1.22.4 includes all these fixes and improvements. Although I think it’s also important to say that all krpano releases since version 1.20.10 from September 2021 have the passQueryParameters setting either disabled by default or set to harmless values and so shouldn’t be affect-able by XSS anymore.\n[…]\n\n\n\nThe XSS itself is not new but the possibility to ‘hack’ Google to use it for ‘spamy’ search results that way is new, at least for me. All the affected webpages were very probably built with much older krpano versions, where the ‘passQueryParameters:true’ was enabled in an default template (a stupid mistake at this time of course).\nAnd that passQueryParameters:true setting is indeed a problem. Everyone with a krpano-based tour on their servers should change that setting to passQueryParameters:false (or remove the setting at all, because the core default setting is and was always false). I’m recommending that already for years, but often websites were built once and then never been touched again (or even been updated)…\nThat means fixing the affected websites would be only the change of a single word: searching for ‘passQueryParameters’ in the html file and if found, changing true to false. And that works for ALL krpano versions.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Critical Vulnerabilities Found in Anti-Spam Plugin Used by 200,000 WordPress Sites\nRelated: Domains Once Owned by Major Firms Help Millions of Spam Emails Bypass Security\n\nThe attacks were observed recently by researcher Oleg Zaytsev who noticed that a Google search revealed what appeared to be adult content on the website of a major university in the US. \n\n\n\nAdditional analysis showed that the impacted website hosted a virtual tour powered by software made by Krpano.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nLet’s examine, through the lens of some historic breaches, the five most common mistakes that still serve as a catalyst to compromise.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nSecurity-oriented news often stays within the security community, that is until it hits home, or often millions of homes. We’ve most recently heard about breaches at National Public Data and Ticketmaster, but there are names from the past that might provoke a twitch or send a chill in those who have been following the industry for some time. Names like Sony, TJX, etc. While household names from a brand perspective, they also are associated with now infamous events in the security world. While these names represent the “crossover” events between the general public and security professionals, they, or more specifically the missteps that felled them, continue to haunt companies today and make them additions to the history books. Let’s examine, through the lens of some historic breaches, the five most common mistakes that still serve as a catalyst to compromise, and best practices to keep yourself out of the classroom curriculum.\n\n\n\nClean up in Segment  7…\nOur first tectonic event was at Target, where attackers jumped from the company’s connected HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems all the way to store Point-of-Sale systems and ended up shoplifting more than 40M credit cards.\n\n\n\nAs Shrek said, “it’s all about layers”. Too many organizations suffer from a very flat architecture, with the boundaries between external resources, users and servers largely open and providing little-to-no resistance to an attacker.  This flat structure “approach” extends to other zones, such as 3rd party networks, subsidiaries and operational technologies (such as HVAC, manufacturing or industrial control systems). There are two levels to defining and then defending your layers.\n\n\n\nPlanning is the first and most basic of architectural measures. Clearly delineating boundaries between zones, what connections and activities are allowed or denied. This is done with edge devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, but as we all know, the best laid plans…\n\n\n\nPurpose-built technology is the next step. Tooling is the more advanced level of architectural hardening.  There are a host of technologies from companies like Illumio, that enable more granular, and even dynamic, on-the-fly segmentation.\n\n\n\nWhen Snowflakes aren’t unique\nJust last year, more than 150 companies fell victim to compromise, with the common denominator being they all hosted cloud assets with cloud behemoth Snowflake. However, it became quickly clear that the commonality at the core was not the cloud vendor, but the common mistake made by all – poor credential hygiene in both user and corporate systems.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nCredential abuse is the starting point for so many breaches, so credential protection needs to be the most important of security table stakes. Protection of these powerful and pervasive assets is a responsibility and a requirement across multiple constituencies and processes. Let’s discuss the four levels of ensuring credential hygiene.\n\n\n\nThe first is focused on credentials and the users who hold them. Companies need to require and enforce strong password hygiene on all users. This should not just be limited to employees, but anyone that interacts with business systems, including customers. Since not all users understand the issues and mechanics involved, offering strong and clear guidance on the dangers of password reuse or insecure creation, and how to ensure secure conventions is a critical need.\n\n\n\nThe second level is enabling the processes and tools to ensure effective secrets management. No matter how strong, the best of passwords can be easily felled by being in discoverable places like Confluence or Sharepoint pages, Git repos or Jira boards, or Sticky Notes.   To combat this, organizations should provide access to, and require the use of password managers to ensure credentials can be both strong, and easy to use.\n\n\n\nThe third level is “secure by design.” Organizations need to help developers by providing and enforcing secure coding practices to prevent the exposure of credentials or tokens in code.\n\n\n\nFinally, and we’ll dive deeper into “safety nets” a little later, understanding that no password or process is infallible, so requiring the use of additional factors in authentication should no longer be considered a “best practice” but an absolute basic control.\n\n\n\nWhat’s in your permissions?  \nAll too often compromise comes in simple human error. For Capital One, it was a mistake and misconfiguration that allowed an attacker to steal 100 million consumer credit applications.\n\n\n\nThis breach is a poster child for the problem of privileges. They are called access “privileges” for a reason. Not everyone should have the “right” to access everything.  Many organizations are overly permissive to account for unforeseen business friction. Wider permissions allow processes to flow more freely and and account for future growth.  Unfortunately, that is literally leaving the door wide open for abuse and compromise.\n\n\n\nThink of it like a house, if you leave every door and window open, from the basement bulkhead to the skylights, all manner of pest and perpetrator will find their way in. \n\n\n\nStarting at the bottom, Active Directory is the identity foundation. Every unnecessary permission – users, devices and applications – puts a crack in that foundation. Many organizations leave access too broad at local or even domain levels, nesting groups based on locations or departments, giving all users in the associated groups permissions only a few need, or should have.\n\n\n\n On the first floor, users are your current residents or trusted neighbors. First off, the locks should be changed from the previous owners and old users should be expunged.  Also, not everyone needs access to your trophy room or your gun safe. Starting with their own systems, every user should not be an admin on their own system – yet in many companies they are. Employees also should have access to only the systems they need, and critical access should only be provisioned for a select few.\n\n\n\nWe’ll end upstairs.  The upper floor windows and skylights are your cloud instances.  Organizations need to find and lock misconfigured and wide open cloud resources. Additionally, enforceable processes should be in place for how new resources are approved, configured and deployed.\n\n\n\nNo Telltale Heart \nIf we’re building a data breach Hall of Shame, Heartland Payment Systems is a candidate in which attackers feasted for more than six, undetected months on more than 100 million credit cards. The massive payment processor was indicative of a wave of what we’ll call compliance reliance.  Industry standards like PCI laid out security requirements for the protection of customer data.  Unfortunately, many companies checked the boxes on these requirements but ignored the fact that they were simply a baseline.  An industry standard doesn’t address individual business dynamics and vulnerability.  This simplistic approach to achieving compliance bred dangerous complacence in many companies.\n\n\n\nIt’s an oft stated sentiment that discomfort is what precipitates change. So many organizations feel overly comfortable and complacent when they check some compliance boxes or deploy a shiny new security product.  This may even work for awhile, and the absence of a visible compromise begets overconfidence.  As another axiom goes, all companies have experienced compromise, some just don’t know it yet.\n\n\n\nWhat this issue comes down to is knowing what is most at risk in your own organization and understanding fully how you are positioned to prevent compromise specific to your environment.  Organizations need to understand what is different about their business apart from what the regulations and requirements cover. These are just as critical, if not more, to address.\n\n\n\nMuch like compliance regulations, security products out-of-the-box are designed and deployed to address the most common threats and risks across most customers.  Without some customization and tuning, they don’t account for your specific environment. A specific example is in signatures and detections. Attackers can determine what security products are in an environment, and already know the standard alert lists.  So, if an organization is relying on out-of-box signatures and definitions only, they are playing right into an attacker’s hands. By leveraging business logic and customization, an organization creates a major blind spot for attackers.\n\n\n\nFor an added layer of protection, consider placing “canaries” in the coalmine.  More mature companies leverage deception to ferret out intrusions.  Honeypots, Honeytokens or false accounts can entice an attacker to reveal themselves at the first whiff of activity.\n\n\n\nDealer’s poor choice\nI intentionally left this category until the end because so many people put it first – as an excuse. The “blame the stupid user” crowd can be deafening. The reality is twofold.  First, we can’t expect everyone to have the same ability to understand and identify social engineering.  Second, attackers continue to find better and better ways to fool their prey, and there are plenty of examples of even the most seasoned security pros falling victim. \n\n\n\nAnother breach this year is sure to stay top of mind for years to come. MGM proved that the house doesn’t always win, when an attacker social engineered their way to take $30 million out of Sin City.\n\n\n\nWe need to help users, not shame them. As noted earlier, employing multiple authentication factors beyond, and in addition to credentials is imperative. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) provides a key element to resisting phishing attempts – whether to backstop an inexperienced user, or to account for an errant click or a decision under duress.  In addition to familiar rotating authentication codes, this category also includes deployment of technologies such as Public Key Cryptography, Biometrics, and Zero Trust architectures. Finally, understanding and activation of these measures is only getting more urgent, as the environment for social engineering is getting increasingly dangerous, with deepfakes and AI making detection of fraudulent requests much harder to discern.\n\t\t\t\nClean up in Segment  7…\nOur first tectonic event was at Target, where attackers jumped from the company’s connected HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems all the way to store Point-of-Sale systems and ended up shoplifting more than 40M credit cards.\n\n\n\nAs Shrek said, “it’s all about layers”.

No matter how strong, the best of passwords can be easily felled by being in discoverable places like Confluence or Sharepoint pages, Git repos or Jira boards, or Sticky Notes.   To combat this, organizations should provide access to, and require the use of password managers to ensure credentials can be both strong, and easy to use.\n\n\n\nThe third level is “secure by design.” Organizations need to help developers by providing and enforcing secure coding practices to prevent the exposure of credentials or tokens in code.\n\n\n\nFinally, and we’ll dive deeper into “safety nets” a little later, understanding that no password or process is infallible, so requiring the use of additional factors in authentication should no longer be considered a “best practice” but an absolute basic control.\n\n\n\nWhat’s in your permissions?  \nAll too often compromise comes in simple human error. For Capital One, it was a mistake and misconfiguration that allowed an attacker to steal 100 million consumer credit applications.\n\n\n\nThis breach is a poster child for the problem of privileges. They are called access “privileges” for a reason. Not everyone should have the “right” to access everything.  Many organizations are overly permissive to account for unforeseen business friction. Wider permissions allow processes to flow more freely and and account for future growth.  Unfortunately, that is literally leaving the door wide open for abuse and compromise.\n\n\n\nThink of it like a house, if you leave every door and window open, from the basement bulkhead to the skylights, all manner of pest and perpetrator will find their way in. \n\n\n\nStarting at the bottom, Active Directory is the identity foundation. Every unnecessary permission – users, devices and applications – puts a crack in that foundation. Many organizations leave access too broad at local or even domain levels, nesting groups based on locations or departments, giving all users in the associated groups permissions only a few need, or should have.\n\n\n\n On the first floor, users are your current residents or trusted neighbors. First off, the locks should be changed from the previous owners and old users should be expunged.  Also, not everyone needs access to your trophy room or your gun safe. Starting with their own systems, every user should not be an admin on their own system – yet in many companies they are. Employees also should have access to only the systems they need, and critical access should only be provisioned for a select few.\n\n\n\nWe’ll end upstairs.  The upper floor windows and skylights are your cloud instances.  Organizations need to find and lock misconfigured and wide open cloud resources. Additionally, enforceable processes should be in place for how new resources are approved, configured and deployed.\n\n\n\nNo Telltale Heart \nIf we’re building a data breach Hall of Shame, Heartland Payment Systems is a candidate in which attackers feasted for more than six, undetected months on more than 100 million credit cards. The massive payment processor was indicative of a wave of what we’ll call compliance reliance.  Industry standards like PCI laid out security requirements for the protection of customer data.  Unfortunately, many companies checked the boxes on these requirements but ignored the fact that they were simply a baseline.  An industry standard doesn’t address individual business dynamics and vulnerability.  This simplistic approach to achieving compliance bred dangerous complacence in many companies.\n\n\n\nIt’s an oft stated sentiment that discomfort is what precipitates change. So many organizations feel overly comfortable and complacent when they check some compliance boxes or deploy a shiny new security product.  This may even work for awhile, and the absence of a visible compromise begets overconfidence.  As another axiom goes, all companies have experienced compromise, some just don’t know it yet.\n\n\n\nWhat this issue comes down to is knowing what is most at risk in your own organization and understanding fully how you are positioned to prevent compromise specific to your environment.  Organizations need to understand what is different about their business apart from what the regulations and requirements cover. These are just as critical, if not more, to address.\n\n\n\nMuch like compliance regulations, security products out-of-the-box are designed and deployed to address the most common threats and risks across most customers.  Without some customization and tuning, they don’t account for your specific environment. A specific example is in signatures and detections. Attackers can determine what security products are in an environment, and already know the standard alert lists.  So, if an organization is relying on out-of-box signatures and definitions only, they are playing right into an attacker’s hands. By leveraging business logic and customization, an organization creates a major blind spot for attackers.\n\n\n\nFor an added layer of protection, consider placing “canaries” in the coalmine.  More mature companies leverage deception to ferret out intrusions.  Honeypots, Honeytokens or false accounts can entice an attacker to reveal themselves at the first whiff of activity.\n\n\n\nDealer’s poor choice\nI intentionally left this category until the end because so many people put it first – as an excuse. The “blame the stupid user” crowd can be deafening. The reality is twofold.  First, we can’t expect everyone to have the same ability to understand and identify social engineering.  Second, attackers continue to find better and better ways to fool their prey, and there are plenty of examples of even the most seasoned security pros falling victim. \n\n\n\nAnother breach this year is sure to stay top of mind for years to come. MGM proved that the house doesn’t always win, when an attacker social engineered their way to take $30 million out of Sin City.\n\n\n\nWe need to help users, not shame them. As noted earlier, employing multiple authentication factors beyond, and in addition to credentials is imperative. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) provides a key element to resisting phishing attempts – whether to backstop an inexperienced user, or to account for an errant click or a decision under duress.  In addition to familiar rotating authentication codes, this category also includes deployment of technologies such as Public Key Cryptography, Biometrics, and Zero Trust architectures. Finally, understanding and activation of these measures is only getting more urgent, as the environment for social engineering is getting increasingly dangerous, with deepfakes and AI making detection of fraudulent requests much harder to discern.\n\t\t\t\nOur first tectonic event was at Target, where attackers jumped from the company’s connected HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems all the way to store Point-of-Sale systems and ended up shoplifting more than 40M credit cards.\n\n\n\nAs Shrek said, “it’s all about layers”. Too many organizations suffer from a very flat architecture, with the boundaries between external resources, users and servers largely open and providing little-to-no resistance to an attacker.  This flat structure “approach” extends to other zones, such as 3rd party networks, subsidiaries and operational technologies (such as HVAC, manufacturing or industrial control systems). There are two levels to defining and then defending your layers.\n\n\n\nPlanning is the first and most basic of architectural measures. Clearly delineating boundaries between zones, what connections and activities are allowed or denied. This is done with edge devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, but as we all know, the best laid plans…\n\n\n\nPurpose-built technology is the next step.

Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nCredential abuse is the starting point for so many breaches, so credential protection needs to be the most important of security table stakes. Protection of these powerful and pervasive assets is a responsibility and a requirement across multiple constituencies and processes. Let’s discuss the four levels of ensuring credential hygiene.\n\n\n\nThe first is focused on credentials and the users who hold them. Companies need to require and enforce strong password hygiene on all users. This should not just be limited to employees, but anyone that interacts with business systems, including customers. Since not all users understand the issues and mechanics involved, offering strong and clear guidance on the dangers of password reuse or insecure creation, and how to ensure secure conventions is a critical need.\n\n\n\nThe second level is enabling the processes and tools to ensure effective secrets management. No matter how strong, the best of passwords can be easily felled by being in discoverable places like Confluence or Sharepoint pages, Git repos or Jira boards, or Sticky Notes.   To combat this, organizations should provide access to, and require the use of password managers to ensure credentials can be both strong, and easy to use.\n\n\n\nThe third level is “secure by design.” Organizations need to help developers by providing and enforcing secure coding practices to prevent the exposure of credentials or tokens in code.\n\n\n\nFinally, and we’ll dive deeper into “safety nets” a little later, understanding that no password or process is infallible, so requiring the use of additional factors in authentication should no longer be considered a “best practice” but an absolute basic control.\n\n\n\nWhat’s in your permissions?  \nAll too often compromise comes in simple human error. For Capital One, it was a mistake and misconfiguration that allowed an attacker to steal 100 million consumer credit applications.\n\n\n\nThis breach is a poster child for the problem of privileges. They are called access “privileges” for a reason. Not everyone should have the “right” to access everything.  Many organizations are overly permissive to account for unforeseen business friction. Wider permissions allow processes to flow more freely and and account for future growth.  Unfortunately, that is literally leaving the door wide open for abuse and compromise.\n\n\n\nThink of it like a house, if you leave every door and window open, from the basement bulkhead to the skylights, all manner of pest and perpetrator will find their way in. \n\n\n\nStarting at the bottom, Active Directory is the identity foundation. Every unnecessary permission – users, devices and applications – puts a crack in that foundation. Many organizations leave access too broad at local or even domain levels, nesting groups based on locations or departments, giving all users in the associated groups permissions only a few need, or should have.\n\n\n\n On the first floor, users are your current residents or trusted neighbors.

The massive payment processor was indicative of a wave of what we’ll call compliance reliance.  Industry standards like PCI laid out security requirements for the protection of customer data.  Unfortunately, many companies checked the boxes on these requirements but ignored the fact that they were simply a baseline.  An industry standard doesn’t address individual business dynamics and vulnerability.  This simplistic approach to achieving compliance bred dangerous complacence in many companies.\n\n\n\nIt’s an oft stated sentiment that discomfort is what precipitates change. So many organizations feel overly comfortable and complacent when they check some compliance boxes or deploy a shiny new security product.  This may even work for awhile, and the absence of a visible compromise begets overconfidence.  As another axiom goes, all companies have experienced compromise, some just don’t know it yet.\n\n\n\nWhat this issue comes down to is knowing what is most at risk in your own organization and understanding fully how you are positioned to prevent compromise specific to your environment.  Organizations need to understand what is different about their business apart from what the regulations and requirements cover.

A specific example is in signatures and detections. Attackers can determine what security products are in an environment, and already know the standard alert lists.  So, if an organization is relying on out-of-box signatures and definitions only, they are playing right into an attacker’s hands.

The “blame the stupid user” crowd can be deafening. The reality is twofold.  First, we can’t expect everyone to have the same ability to understand and identify social engineering.  Second, attackers continue to find better and better ways to fool their prey, and there are plenty of examples of even the most seasoned security pros falling victim. \n\n\n\nAnother breach this year is sure to stay top of mind for years to come. MGM proved that the house doesn’t always win, when an attacker social engineered their way to take $30 million out of Sin City.\n\n\n\nWe need to help users, not shame them. As noted earlier, employing multiple authentication factors beyond, and in addition to credentials is imperative. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) provides a key element to resisting phishing attempts – whether to backstop an inexperienced user, or to account for an errant click or a decision under duress.  In addition to familiar rotating authentication codes, this category also includes deployment of technologies such as Public Key Cryptography, Biometrics, and Zero Trust architectures. Finally, understanding and activation of these measures is only getting more urgent, as the environment for social engineering is getting increasingly dangerous, with deepfakes and AI making detection of fraudulent requests much harder to discern.\n\t\t\t\nThe third level is “secure by design.” Organizations need to help developers by providing and enforcing secure coding practices to prevent the exposure of credentials or tokens in code.\n\n\n\nFinally, and we’ll dive deeper into “safety nets” a little later, understanding that no password or process is infallible, so requiring the use of additional factors in authentication should no longer be considered a “best practice” but an absolute basic control.\n\n\n\nWhat’s in your permissions?  \nAll too often compromise comes in simple human error. For Capital One, it was a mistake and misconfiguration that allowed an attacker to steal 100 million consumer credit applications.\n\n\n\nThis breach is a poster child for the problem of privileges. They are called access “privileges” for a reason. Not everyone should have the “right” to access everything.  Many organizations are overly permissive to account for unforeseen business friction. Wider permissions allow processes to flow more freely and and account for future growth.  Unfortunately, that is literally leaving the door wide open for abuse and compromise.\n\n\n\nThink of it like a house, if you leave every door and window open, from the basement bulkhead to the skylights, all manner of pest and perpetrator will find their way in. \n\n\n\nStarting at the bottom, Active Directory is the identity foundation.

The attack was quickly linked to North Korean hackers, specifically the notorious Lazarus group. \n\n\n\nIn an alert published on Wednesday, the FBI said a threat actor it tracks as TraderTraitor, which the agency has been monitoring since 2022 for its attacks on blockchain companies, was behind the Bybit hack. \n\n\n\nThe FBI indicated in the past that TraderTraitor is a different name for the Lazarus group, but some members of the cybersecurity industry described it as a Lazarus campaign focusing on cryptocurrency attacks. The Lazarus group has also been known to conduct cyberespionage and destructive operations. \n\n\n\n“TraderTraitor actors are proceeding rapidly and have converted some of the stolen assets to Bitcoin and other virtual assets dispersed across thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains. It is expected these assets will be further laundered and eventually converted to fiat currency,” the FBI said.\n\n\n\nThe FBI previously linked TraderTraitor to a $308 million cryptocurrency heist from Bitcoin.DMM.com.\n\n\n\nThe agency has published a list of cryptocurrency addresses known to have been used by the North Korean threat actor. \n\n\n\nBybit, which claims to be the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has launched a bug bounty program in an effort to recover the stolen funds, offering 5% of the recovered amount to the entity that manages to freeze the funds and 5% to those who helped trace the funds. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nHowever, only 3% ($42 million) of the stolen cryptocurrency has been frozen to date, which is the amount that was blocked soon after the hack came to light — it appears no other funds have been recovered since. Nearly $95 million are currently marked as ‘awaiting response’. \n\n\n\nBybit says it has paid out over $4 million in bounties to those who have helped track and freeze funds. The company noted that some cryptocurrency services have refused to cooperate. \n\n\n\n“We have assigned a team to maintain and update this website, we will not stop until Lazarus or bad actors in the industry is eliminated,” said Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit. “In the future we will open it up [the bug bounty platform] to other victims of Lazarus as well.”\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange has assured customers that their assets are backed and the company is solvent even if the stolen funds will not be recovered. \n\n\n\nBybit has hired Sygnia and Verichains to investigate the incident and the companies claim to have determined the root cause — the attack involved malicious code originating from Safe{Wallet} infrastructure (specifically an AWS S3 bucket) and there is no indication that Bybit’s own infrastructure was compromised.\n\n\n\nSafe{Wallet}, a decentralized custody protocol and collective asset management platform, issued a statement confirming that it was targeted by Lazarus hackers, who compromised a Safe{Wallet} developer’s machine. The company pointed out that its smart contracts are not affected, and neither is the source code of the frontend and its services.\n\n\n\nBased on the information available to date, it appears that the attacker replaced a benign Safe{Wallet} JavaScript file with malicious code on February 19. The malicious code, which targeted Bybit’s Ethereum cold wallet, was designed to activate during the next transaction, which occurred on February 21.\n\n\n\nThe malicious code manipulated the content of the transaction during the signing process, making it appear as if the funds were being transferred to the correct address when in reality they went to an address controlled by the hackers.\n\n\n\nThe attackers then quickly removed the malicious code from the Safe{Wallet} JavaScript file.\n\n\n\nThe 2025 Crypto Crime Report published by Chainalysis on Wednesday shows that cryptocurrency addresses known to have been used for illegal activities received — based on data collected to date — roughly $40 billion in 2024, but the amount is expected to increase to $51 billion once all the data is analyzed. \n\n\n\nRelated: Wallet Drainer Malware Used to Steal $500 Million in Cryptocurrency in 2024\nRelated: US Charges 3 Russians for Operating Cryptocurrency Mixers Used by Cybercriminals\nRelated: Hackers Drain Over $85 Million From Crypto Exchange Phemex\nRelated: Indiana Man Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for Hacking, $37 Million Crypto Theft\n\nThe Bybit hack, which resulted in the theft of nearly $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum cryptocurrency, was carried out on February 21.
