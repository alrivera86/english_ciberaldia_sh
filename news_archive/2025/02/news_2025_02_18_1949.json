        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers are alerting to a new campaign that leverages web injects to deliver a new Apple macOS malware known as\nFrigidStealer\n.\nThe activity has been attributed to a previously undocumented threat actor known as TA2727, with the information stealers for other platforms such as Windows (\nLumma Stealer\nor\nDeerStealer\n) and Android (\nMarcher\n).\nTA2727 is a \"threat actor that uses fake update themed lures to distribute a variety of malware payloads,\" the Proofpoint Threat Research Team\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\nIt's one of the newly identified threat activity clusters alongside TA2726, which is assessed to be a malicious traffic distribution system (TDS) operator that facilitates traffic distribution for other threat actors to deliver malware. The financially motivated threat actor is believed to be active since at least September 2022.\nTA2726, per the enterprise security firm, acts as a TDS for TA2727 and another threat actor called\nTA569\n, which is responsible for the distribution of a JavaScript-based loader malware referred to as\nSocGholish\n(aka FakeUpdates) that often masquerades as a browser update on legitimate-but-compromised sites.\n\"TA2726 is financially motivated and works with other financially motivated actors such as TA569 and TA2727,\" the company noted. \"That is, this actor is most likely responsible for the web server or website compromises that lead to injects operated by other threat actors.\"\nBoth TA569 and TA2727 share some similarities in that they are distributed via websites compromised with malicious JavaScript website injects that mimic browser updates for web browsers like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Where TA2727 differs is the use of attack chains that serve different payloads based on recipients' geography or device.\nShould a user visit an infected website in France or the U.K. on a Windows computer, they are prompted to download an MSI installer file that launches\nHijack Loader\n(aka DOILoader), which, in turn, loads Lumma Stealer.\nOn the other hand, the same fake update redirect when visited from an Android device leads to the deployment of a banking trojan dubbed\nMarcher\nthat has been\ndetected in the wild\nfor over a decade.\nThat's not all. As of January 2025, the campaign has been updated to target macOS users residing outside of North America by redirecting them to a fake update page that downloaded a new information stealer codenamed FrigidStealer.\nThe FrigidStealer installer, like other macOS malware, requires users to explicitly launch the unsigned app to bypass\nGatekeeper protections\n, following which an embedded Mach-O executable is run to install the malware.\n\"The executable was written in Go, and was ad-hoc signed,\" Proofpoint said. \"The executable was built with the WailsIO project, which renders content in the user's browser. This adds to the social engineering of the victim, implying that the Chrome or Safari installer was legitimate.\"\nFrigidStealer is no different from\nvarious stealer families\naimed at macOS systems. It leverages AppleScript to prompt the user to enter their system password, thereby giving it elevated privileges to harvest files and all kinds of sensitive information from web browsers, Apple Notes, and cryptocurrency related apps.\n\"Actors are using web compromises to deliver malware targeting both enterprise and consumer users,\" the company said. \"It is reasonable that such web injects will deliver malware customized to the recipient, including Mac users, which are still less common in enterprise environments than Windows.\"\nThe development comes as Denwp Research's Tonmoy Jitu\ndisclosed\ndetails of another fully undetectable macOS backdoor named Tiny FUD that leverages name manipulation, dynamic link daemon (DYLD) injection, and command-and-control (C2) based command execution.\nIt also follows the emergence of new information stealer malware like\nAstral Stealer\nand\nFlesh Stealer\n, both of which are designed to collect sensitive information, evade detection, and maintain persistence on compromised systems.\n\"Flesh Stealer is particularly effective in detecting virtual machine (VM) environments,\" Flashpoint\nsaid\nin a recent report. \"It will avoid executing on VMs to prevent any potential forensics analysis, showcasing an understanding of security research practices.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Is AI\nreally\nreshaping the cyber threat landscape, or is the constant drumbeat of hype drowning out actual, more tangible, real-world dangers? According to Picus Labs'\nRed Report 2025\nwhich analyzed over one million malware samples, there's been no significant surge, so far, in AI-driven attacks. Yes, adversaries are definitely continuing to innovate, and while AI will certainly start playing a larger and larger role, the latest data suggests that a set of well-known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are still dominating the field.\nThe hype around artificial intelligence has certainly been dominating media headlines; yet the real-world data paints a far more nuanced picture of which malware threats are thriving, and why. Here's a glimpse at the most critical findings and trends shaping the year's most deployed adversarial campaigns and what steps cybersecurity teams need to take to respond to them.\nWhy the AI Hype is Falling Short…at Least For Now\nWhile headlines are trumpeting AI as the one-size-fits-all new secret weapon for cybercriminals, the statistics—again, so far—are telling a very different story. In fact, after poring over the data,\nPicus Labs found no meaningful upswing in AI-based tactics in 2024\n. Yes, adversaries have started incorporating AI for efficiency gains, such as crafting more credible phishing emails or creating/ debugging malicious code, but they haven't yet tapped AI's transformational power in the vast majority of their attacks so far. In fact, the data from the\nRed Report 2025\nshows that you can still thwart the majority of attacks by focusing on tried-and-true TTPs.\n\"Security teams should prioritize identifying and addressing critical gaps in their defenses, rather than fixating on the potential influence of AI.\" — Picus Red Report 2025\nCredential Theft Spikes More Than 3X (8% → 25%)\nAttackers are increasingly targeting password stores, browser-stored credentials, and cached logins, leveraging stolen keys to escalate privileges and spread within networks. This threefold jump underscores the urgent need for ongoing and robust credential management combined with proactive threat detection.\nModern infostealer malware orchestrates multi-stage style heists blending stealth, automation, and persistence. With legitimate processes cloaking malicious operations and actual day-to-day network traffic hiding nefarious data uploads, bad actors can exfiltrate data right under your security team's proverbial nose, no Hollywood-style \"smash-and-grab\" needed. Think of it as the digital equivalent of a perfectly choreographed burglary. Only the criminals don't peel out in a getaway car; they lurk silently, awaiting your next misstep or opening.\n93% of Malware Uses at Least One Top 10 MITRE ATT&CK Technique\nDespite the expansive\nMITRE ATT&CK® framework\n, most adversaries stick to a core set of TTPs. Among the Top 10 ATT&CK techniques provided in the Red Report, the following exfiltration and stealth techniques remain the most used:\nT1055 (Process Injection)\nallows attackers to inject malicious code into trusted system processes, making detection more challenging.\nT1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter)\nlets adversaries run harmful commands or scripts from within legitimate interpreters on target machines.\nT1071 (Application Layer Protocols)\ngives attackers \"whisper channels\" for command-and-control and data exfiltration, hidden in common protocols like HTTPS or DNS-over-HTTPS.\nThe combined effect? Legitimate-seeming processes use legitimate tools to collect and transmit data over widely used network channels. Not surprisingly, these techniques can be difficult to detect through signature-based methods alone. However, using behavioral analysis, particularly when multiple techniques are used to monitor and correlate data together, makes it far easier to spot anomalies. Security teams need to focus on looking for malicious activity that appears virtually indistinguishable from normal network traffic.\nBack to Basics for a Better Defense\nToday's threats often chain together numerous attack stages to infiltrate, persist, and exfiltrate. By the time one step is identified, attackers may already have moved on to the next. So, while the threat landscape is undeniably sophisticated, the silver lining uncovered in the Red Report 2025 is rather straightforward:\nmost current malicious activity actually revolves around a small set of attack techniques.\nBy doubling down on modern cyber security fundamentals, such as rigorous credential protection, advanced threat detection, and continuous security validation, organizations can confidently ignore the tsunami of AI hype for now and focus instead on confronting the threats that are actually targeting them today.\nReady to Cut Through the AI Hype and Strengthen Your Defenses?\nWhile the headlines are fixated on AI, Picus Security, the pioneer of\nBreach and Attack Simulation (BAS)\nsince 2013, is intently focused on the methods and techniques attackers are actually using: tried-and-true TTPs. The Picus Security Validation Platform continuously assesses and fortifies organizations' defenses, emphasizing fundamentals like credential protection and rapid threat detection.\nReady to see the difference for yourself?\nDownload the Picus Red Report 2025\nor visit\npicussecurity.com\nto learn how to tune out the hype and keep real threats at bay.\nNote:\nThis article was written by\nDr. Suleyman Ozarslan\n, co-founder of Picus Security and VP of Picus Labs, where simulating cyber threats and strengthening organizations' defenses are what we do every day.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

This means they could then move laterally within an organization's environment and compromise other critical Windows servers and file systems.\"\nThe identified vulnerabilities, which affect firmware versions 57.69.91 and earlier, are listed below -\nCVE-2024-12510\n(CVSS score: 6.7) - Pass-back attack via LDAP\nCVE-2024-12511\n(CVSS score: 7.6) - Pass-back attack via user's address book\nSuccessful exploitation of CVE-2024-12510 could allow authentication information to be redirected to a rogue server, potentially exposing credentials. This, however, requires an attacker to gain access to the LDAP configuration page and that LDAP is used for authentication.\nCVE-2024-12511, likewise, allows a malicious actor to gain access to the user address book configuration to modify the SMB or FTP server's IP address and make it point to a host under their control, causing SMB or FTP authentication credentials to be captured during file scan operations.\n\"For this attack to be successful, the attacker requires an SMB or FTP scan function to be configured within the user's address book, as well as physical access to the printer console or access to remote-control console via the web interface,\" Heiland noted. \"This may require admin access unless user level access to the remote-control console has been enabled.\"\nFollowing responsible disclosure on March 26, 2024, the vulnerabilities were addressed as part of\nService Pack 57.75.53\nreleased late last month for VersaLink C7020, 7025, and 7030 series printers.\nIf immediate patching is not an option, users are recommended to set a complex password for the admin account, avoid using Windows authentication accounts that have elevated privileges, and disable the remote-control console for unauthenticated users.\nThe development comes as Specular founder and CEO Peyton Smith detailed an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability affecting a widely deployed healthcare software named\nHealthStream MSOW\n(CVE-2024-56735) that could lead to a full database compromise, allowing threat actors to access sensitive data of 23 healthcare organizations from the public internet.\nThe company said it identified 50 instances of internet-exposed MSOW instances, of which 23 are susceptible to security shortcomings.\nThe vulnerability could allow \"the entire database could be returned in-band, meaning an attacker could retrieve the plaintext database contents in a HTTP response from a crafted SQL injection HTTP payload,\" Smith\nsaid\n.\nFound this article interesting?

The attacks are known to employ a wide range of techniques – both on client- and server-side – to compromise websites and deploy credit card skimmers to facilitate theft.\nTypically, such malware is only triggered or loaded when users visit the checkout pages to enter credit card details by either serving a fake form or capturing the information entered by the victims in real time.\nThe term MageCart is a reference to the original target of these cybercrime groups, the Magento platform that offers checkout and shopping cart features for online retailers. Over the years, such campaigns\nadapted their tactics\nby concealing malicious code through encoding and obfuscation within seemingly harmless sources, such as fake images, audio files, favicons, and even 404 error pages.\n\"In this case, the malware affecting the client follows the same goal — staying hidden,\" Sucuri researcher Kayleigh Martin\nsaid\n. \"It does this by disguising malicious content inside an\n<img> tag\n, making it easy to overlook.\"\n\"It's common for <img> tags to contain long strings, especially when referencing image file paths or Base64-encoded images, along with additional attributes like height and width.\"\nThe only difference is that the <img> tag, in this case, acts as a decoy, containing Base64-encoded content that points to JavaScript code that's activated when an\nonerror event\nis detected. This makes the attack a lot more sneaky, as the browser inherently trusts the onerror function.\n\"If an image fails to load, the onerror function will trigger the browser to show a broken image icon instead,\" Martin said. \"However, in this context, the onerror event is hijacked to execute JavaScript instead of just handling the error.\"\nFurthermore, the attack offers an added advantage to threat actors in that the <img> HTML element is generally considered innocuous. The malware, for its part, checks whether the user is on the checkout page and waits for unsuspecting users to click on the submit button to siphon sensitive payment information entered by them to an external server.\nThe script is designed to dynamically insert a malicious form with three fields, Card Number, Expiration Date, and CVV, with the goal of exfiltrating it to wellfacing[.]com.\n\"The attacker accomplishes two impressive goals with this malicious script: avoiding easy detection by security scanners by encoding the malicious script within an <img> tag, and ensuring end users don't notice unusual changes when the malicious form is inserted, staying undetected as long as possible,\" Martin said.\n\"The goal of attackers who are targeting platforms like Magento, WooCommerce, PrestaShop and others is to remain undetected as long as possible, and the malware they inject into sites is often more complex than the more commonly found pieces of malware impacting other sites.\"\nThe development comes as the website security company detailed an incident involving a WordPress site that leveraged the\nmu-plugins\n(or must-use plugins) directory to implant backdoors and execute malicious PHP code in a stealthy manner.\n\"Unlike regular plugins, must-use plugins are automatically loaded on every page load, without needing activation or appearing in the standard plugin list,\" Puja Srivastava\nsaid\n.\n\"Attackers exploit this directory to maintain persistence and evade detection, as files placed here execute automatically and are not easily disabled from the WordPress admin panel.\"\nFound this article interesting?

It mostly impacted users from Germany, Russia, Brazil, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.\nThe threat actors uploaded infected game installers onto torrent sites in September 2024, months in advance, and triggered the payloads within the games during the holidays, making detection less likely.\nStaryDobry campaign timeline\nSource: Kaspersky\nStaryDobry infection chain\nThe StaryDobry campaign used a multi-stage infection chain culminating with an XMRig cryptominer infection.\nUsers downloaded the trojanized game installers from torrent sites, which appeared normal, including the actual game they were promised, plus malicious code.\nOne of the malicious torrents used in the campaign\nSource: Kaspersky\nDuring the game's installation, the malware dropper (unrar.dll) is unpacked and launched in the background, and it checks if it's running on a virtual machine, sandbox, or debugger before proceeding.\nThe malware demonstrates highly evasive behavior, terminating immediately if it detects any security tools, possibly to avoid harming the torrent's reputation.\nAnti-debug checks\nSource: Kaspersky\nNext, the malware registers itself using 'regsvr32.exe' for persistence and collects detailed system information, including OS version, country, CPU, RAM, and GPU details, and sends it to the command and control (C2) server at pinokino[.]fun.\nEventually, the dropper decrypts and installs the malware loader (MTX64.exe) in a system directory.\nThe loader poses as a Windows system file, engages in resource spoofing to appear legitimate, and creates a scheduled task to persist between reboots. If the host machine has at least eight CPU cores, it downloads and runs an XMRig miner.\nThe XMRig miner used in StaryDobry is a modified version of the Monero miner that constructs its configuration internally before execution and does not access arguments.\nThe miner maintains a separate thread at all times, monitoring for security tools running on the infected machine, and if any process monitoring tools are detected, it shuts itself down.\nThe XMRig used in these attacks connects to private mining servers instead of public pools, making the proceeds harder to trace.\nKaspersky has not been able to attribute the attacks to any known threat groups but notes that it likely originates from a Russian-speaking actor.\n\"StaryDobry tends to be a one-shot campaign. To deliver the miner implant, the actors implemented a sophisticated execution chain that exploited users seeking free games,\" concluded Kaspersky.\n\"This approach helped the threat actors make the most out of the miner implant by targeting powerful gaming machines capable of sustaining mining activity.\"\nRelated Articles:\nMalicious Rspack, Vant packages published using stolen NPM tokens\nHackers target Docker, Hadoop, Redis, Confluence with new Golang malware\nFake CrowdStrike job offer emails target devs with crypto miners\nHacker pleads guilty to SIM swap attack on US SEC X account\nPirateFi game on Steam caught installing password-stealing malware"

        "Content": "By Autumn Stambaugh, Senior Sales Engineer at Pentera\nThink you're safe because you're compliant? Think again. Recent studies continue to highlight the concerning trend that compliance with major security frameworks does not necessarily prevent data breaches. For instance, in 2024,\nthe average cost of a data breach reached\nan all-time high of $4.88 million, a 10% increase from the previous year.\nThe latest high-profile breaches at\nMGM Resorts\n,\nAT&T\n, and Ticketmaster prove that compliance alone won’t stop attackers. All of these organizations adhered to compliance frameworks, yet compliance alone didn’t stop these attacks.\nInstead, adversaries exploited vulnerabilities that hadn’t been properly patched, misconfigurations that went undetected, and weak security controls. These organizations still suffered massive cyberattacks, resulting in data exposure, financial losses, and operational disruptions.\nThe harsh reality? Attackers get through the gaps of your compliance checklist.\nThe Disconnect Between Compliance and Security\nCompliance frameworks like PCI-DSS, SEC, and\nDORA\nare designed to protect sensitive data and reduce risk, providing clear guidance on managing confidentiality, integrity, and availability. But these frameworks are just that—guidance. They don’t address the dynamic nature of today’s threats, nor do they assess the effectiveness of the controls organizations implement.\nFor many companies, compliance is treated as the finish line rather than a baseline for security. Organizations focus on passing audits, deploying firewalls, and implementing detection & response tools to satisfy regulatory mandates.\nBut compliance alone doesn’t measure whether these controls can withstand real-world threats. Without continuous validation, security teams remain blind to gaps that attackers can exploit.\nA Proactive Approach: Testing Your Defenses Like an Attacker\nInstead of relying on compliance as a security strategy, organizations must adopt a proactive approach that validates security controls against real-world attack methods. Here’s how:\nEmulate Real-World Attacks\nSimulated attacks expose security gaps that compliance frameworks can’t detect. Regular penetration testing, red teaming, and automated continuous validation allow organizations to measure how well their defenses perform against adversarial tactics. Security controls should be tested under realistic conditions—not just during compliance audits.\nTackle Credential Exposure\nCompromised credentials remain one of the top attack vectors. Organizations must actively monitor for exposed credentials across dark web forums and paste sites, ensuring they can revoke access before attackers can exploit it. Enforcing strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) further reduces this risk.\nTest and Update Continuously\nCyber threats evolve rapidly, and new vulnerabilities emerge daily. For example, the\nMOVEit Transfer zero-day vulnerability discovered in 2023\nled to widespread data breaches, affecting hundreds of organizations. This highlights how attackers constantly exploit new weaknesses before security teams have a chance to respond.\nOrganizations should prioritize ongoing security testing, including:\nRoutine penetration tests to identify weak points.\nIncident response exercises to validate detection and response capabilities.\nConfiguration reviews to prevent security drift over time.\nBridging the Gap: Compliance as a Starting Point\nWhile compliance frameworks establish a strong foundation, they should never be treated as the finish line. Organizations must go beyond regulatory requirements by incorporating proactive security measures, such as:\nValidating defenses regularly to ensure effectiveness\nIdentifying gaps in vendor security and third-party integrations\nEliminating security weaknesses caused by misconfigurations, poor access controls, and outdated policies.\nTakeaway: Compliance Without Testing is a Risk\nAttackers don’t care about compliance—they care about finding vulnerabilities. Companies that rely solely on regulatory checklists will continue to suffer breaches, even when fully certified. The key to security is not just meeting compliance requirements but actively testing, validating, and improving defenses against real-world attacks.\nTo stay ahead of attackers, organizations must treat compliance as a foundation, not a security strategy. Investing in continuous security validation, proactive testing, and adversary emulation ensures that security measures work when it matters most.\nDon’t just check the box—test your security. Invest in\nautomated security validation\n, schedule regular penetration tests, and continuously challenge your defenses to ensure they can withstand real-world attacks.\nSponsored and written by\nPentera\n."

Both flaws enable what are known as pass-back attacks, a class of attacks that essentially allow a bad actor to capture user credentials by manipulating the MFPs' configuration.\nIn certain situations, a malicious actor who successfully exploits the Xerox printer vulnerabilities would be able to capture credentials for Windows Active Directory, according to researchers at Rapid7 who discovered the flaws. \"This means they could then move laterally within an organization's environment and compromise other critical Windows servers and file systems,\" Deral Heiland, principal security researcher, IoT, for Rapid7 wrote in a recent blog post.\nXerox describes VersaLink C7025 as a multifunction printer featuring ConnectKey, a Xerox technology that allows customers to interact with the printers over the cloud and via mobile devices. Among other things, the technology includes security features that, according to Xerox, help prevent attacks, detect potentially malicious changes to the printer, and protect against unauthorized transmission of critical data. Xerox has positioned its VersaLink family of printers as ideal for small and medium-sized workgroups that print around 7,000 pages per month.\nThe two vulnerabilities that Rapid7 discovered in the printer, and which Xerox has since fixed, are CVE-2024-12510 (CVSS score: 6.7), an LDAP pass-back vulnerability; and CVE-2024-12511 (CVSS score: 7.6) an SMB/FTP pass-back vulnerability.\nThe vulnerabilities, according to Rapid7, allow an attacker to change the MFP's configuration so as to cause the printer to send a user's authentication credentials to an attacker-controlled system. The attack would work if a vulnerable Xerox VersaLink C7025 printer is configured for LDAP and/or SMB services.\nIn such a situation, CVE-2024-12510 would allow an attacker to access the MFP's LDAP configuration page and change the LDAP server IP address in the printer's settings to point to their own malicious LDAP server. When the printer next tries to authenticate users by checking the LDAP User Mappings page, it connects to the attacker's fake LDAP server instead of the legitimate corporate LDAP server. This paves the way for the attacker to capture clear text LDAP service credentials, Heiland wrote.\nCVE-2024-12511 allows similar credential capture when the SMB or FTP scan function is enabled on a vulnerable Xerox VersaLink C7025 printer. An attacker with admin-level access can modify the SMB or FTP server's IP address to their own malicious IP and capture SMM or FTP authentication credentials.\nAll it takes for an attacker to discover a vulnerable printer is to connect to an affected Xerox MFP device through a Web browser, validate that the default password is still enabled, and ensure that the device is configured for LDAP and/or SMB services, Heiland tells Dark Reading. \"Also, it is often possible to query an MFP via SNMP and identify if LDAP services are enabled and configured.\"\nThe risk for organizations is that if a malicious actor were to gain any level of access to a business network, they could use the pass-back attack to easily harvest Active Directory credentials without being detected, he says. That would then allow them to pivot to more critical Windows systems within a compromised environment. \"Sadly,\" he adds, \"it's also not uncommon to find LDAP settings on MFP devices that contain Domain Admin credentials,\" which potentially could give a bad actor complete control of an organization's Windows environment.\n\"Since LDAP and SMB settings on MFP devices typically contain Windows Active Directory credentials, a successful attack would give a malicious actor access to Windows file services, domain information, email accounts, and database systems,\" Heiland says. \"If a Domain Admin account or account with elevated privileges was used for LDAP or SMB, then an attacker would have unfettered access to potentially everything within the organization's Windows environment.\"\nJim Routh, chief trust officer at Saviynt, says an attacker would need relatively sophisticated technical skills to exploit these kinds of vulnerabilities. But for those who can, the LDAP vulnerability enables access to Windows Active Directory where all administrator profiles and credentials reside. \"It's the ideal scenario for the threat actor,\" he notes. Every device connected to the Internet has configuration options that offer … an attack surface for the cybercriminal.\"\nXerox has released a patched version of the affected Xerox VersaLink MFP firmware, allowing customer organizations to update and fix the issues. Organizations that cannot immediately patch should set a \"complex password for the admin account and also avoid using Windows authentication accounts that have elevated privileges, such as a Domain Admin account for LDAP or scan-to-file SMB services,\" according to the Rapid7 blog post. \"Also, organizations should avoid enabling the remote-control console for unauthenticated users.\"\nPrinter vulnerabilities are a growing problem for many organizations because of the rise in remote and hybrid work models. A 2024 study by Quocirca found 67% of organizations had experienced a security incident tied to a printer vulnerability, up from 61% the prior year. Despite the trend, many organizations continue to underestimate printer-related threats, making it a soft spot for attackers to target.\nJai Vijayan, Contributing Writer\n\nJai Vijayan is a seasoned technology reporter with over 20 years of experience in IT trade journalism.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nMicrosoft is warning the modular and potentially wormable Apple-focused infostealer boasts new capabilities for obfuscation, persistence, and infection, and could lead to a supply chain attack.\nFebruary 18, 2025\nAttackers are wielding a new variant of one of the biggest threats to the macOS platform, malware called XCSSET, Microsoft is warning. The fresh version has so far been seen in a handful of attacks targeting Apple developers, but its reach could grow much longer in the coming weeks.\nXCSSET can read and dump data from Safari browsers; inject JavaScript backdoors into websites; steal information from the victim's Skype, Telegram, WeChat, Notes, and other apps; take screenshots; encrypt files; and exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled systems. The new variant — which features enhanced obfuscation methods, updated persistence mechanisms, and new infection strategies — is the first known update to the malware since 2022, Microsoft Threat Intelligence revealed in a post on X this week.\n\"These enhanced features add to this malware family's previously known capabilities, like targeting digital wallets, collecting data from the Notes app, and exfiltrating system information and files,\" according to the post.\nResearchers at Trend Micro first discovered XCSSET in 2020 when investigating a security incident related to Xcode developer projects; the malware in the past has targeted software developers by exploiting vulnerabilities and then infecting their projects, using this as a means to spread. If one of the infected projects is downloaded and built by another developer, XCSSET also infects their projects, which could in turn be downloaded by others. This gives the malware wormable capability, and the potential for a broader supply chain attack.\nThe variant appears to be a significant update to the modular malware, with various new features that make it easier for attackers to spread XCSSET and also obscure their malicious activities.\nEnhanced obfuscation methods present in XCSSET use \"a significantly more randomized approach for generating payloads to infect Xcode projects,\" randomizing both its encoding technique and a number of encoding iterations, according to Microsoft.\nAnd while older XCSSET variants only used xxd (hexdump) for encoding, the latest one also incorporates Base64 and obfuscates module names. This makes it more challenging to determine the intent of the malware's modules, Microsoft said.\nIts operators also have outfitted the variant with two distinct new persistence mechanisms: the \"zshrc\" method and the \"dock\" method. In the former method, the malware creates a file named ~/.zshrc_aliases that contains the payload, according to Microsoft. \"It then appends a command in the ~/.zshrc file to ensure that the created file is launched every time a new shell session is initiated, guaranteeing the malware's persistence across shell sessions,\" according to the post.\nThe dock method involves downloading a signed dockutil tool from a command-and-control (C2) server to manage the dock items, and then creating a fake Launchpad application, replacing the legitimate Launchpad's path entry in the dock with this fake one.\n\"This ensures that every time the Launchpad is started from the dock, both the legitimate Launchpad and the malicious payload are executed,\" according to Microsoft.\nThe variant also employs new infection methods that determine where the payload is placed in Xcode projects. The method is chosen from one of the following options: TARGET, RULE, or FORCED_STRATEGY, while an additional method involves placing the payload inside the TARGET_DEVICE_FAMILY key under build settings and running it at a later phase.\nThough traditionally not a target for threat actors, the macOS platform has become increasingly more at risk to malware and other security threats in recent years, mainly due to Apple's growing market share in a shrinking PC market.\nTo avoid downloading Xcode projects infected with XCSSET, Microsoft recommends that developers and users \"always inspect and verify any Xcode projects downloaded or cloned from repositories\" that potentially will spread the malware.\n\"They should also only install apps from trusted sources, such as a software platform’s official app store,\" according to Microsoft.\nUsers of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Mac should be protected against XCSSET, including its new variant, the company added, because it can detect all currently known versions of the malware.\n\nElizabeth Montalbano, Contributing Writer\n\nElizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer, journalist, and therapeutic writing mentor with more than 25 years of professional experience.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nNews, news analysis, and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology.\n\nFebruary 18, 2025\nPRESS RELEASE\nAUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- enQase, a groundbreaking quantum-safe security solution, launches today to safeguard the most sensitive information against the threat of quantum attacks. This innovative solution addresses the urgent calls from leading business technology analyst, cybersecurity experts, and governments worldwide who are stressing the importance to fortify digital defenses against quantum computing threats.\nThe urgency to act is because the stakes are high, as malicious hackers who acquire highly sensitive encrypted data today could decrypt soon with quantum computers – thus the term \"harvest now, decrypt later\".\nWhy enQase exists \nIn August 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released its recommendations for PQC urging all sectors to urgently begin transitioning to higher levels of cryptographic protection.\nExperts, including the World Economic Forum, recommend combining PQC with Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) to provide organizations with the strongest protection against future quantum computing threats. While PQC is anticipated to offer good data security, the integration of both technologies is considered the most comprehensive approach to safeguarding sensitive information in the post-quantum era.\nCertain limitations that have prompted organizations and sectors to explore more comprehensive security solutions for their most highly sensitive information include:\nTheoretical foundations: PQC standards are grounded on theoretical analyses and projections of quantum computer capabilities. The security of these algorithms relies on mathematical assumptions that may be challenged as quantum technology advances.\nDeterministic Algorithms: PQC utilizes deterministic algorithms, which could potentially be vulnerable to unforeseen weaknesses or breakthroughs in quantum computing.\nReliance on PRNGs: PQC implementations often depend on Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) for key generation and other random values. The security of these systems could be compromised if the PRNGs are found to be predictable or vulnerable to quantum attacks.\nIn comparison, enQase takes quantum-safe security beyond conventional standards by harnessing the power of quantum mechanics to fortify and 'enQase' NIST's PQC standards. This innovative approach provides organizations with unparalleled assurance that their information will remain secure today, against \"Harvest now, Decrypt later\" attacks, and well into the future.\nHow enQase ensures future-proof security\nIn an era where traditional encryption methods are increasingly vulnerable, enQase stands as a beacon of innovation. Our quantum-enhanced security platform doesn't just meet today's standards—it defines tomorrow's.\nThe comprehensive platform leverages PQC, Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG), digital Quantum Key Distribution (dQKD), and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). At the forefront of innovation, enQase offers an industry-first hybrid key distribution system that uniquely combines both QKD and dQKD technologies.\nenQase offers unparalleled deployment flexibility, with options ranging from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), perpetual licensing and on-premises hardware solutions. The platform seamlessly integrates with existing infrastructure while ensuring full-stack interoperability and scalability to meet evolving security needs.\n\"enQase counters this threat with a robust data security solution that leverages quantum mechanics to enhance NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) protection.

        "Content": "Carding — the underground business of stealing, selling and swiping stolen payment card data — has long been the dominion of Russia-based hackers. Happily, the broad deployment of more secure chip-based payment cards in the United States has weakened the carding market. But a flurry of innovation from cybercrime groups in China is breathing new life into the carding industry, by turning phished card data into mobile wallets that can be used online and at main street stores.\nAn image from one Chinese phishing group’s Telegram channel shows various toll road phish kits available.\nIf you own a mobile phone, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years it has received at least one phishing message that spoofs the U.S. Postal Service to supposedly collect some outstanding delivery fee, or an SMS that pretends to be a local toll road operator warning of a delinquent toll fee.\nThese messages are being sent through sophisticated phishing kits sold by several cybercriminals based in mainland China. And they are not traditional SMS phishing or “smishing” messages, as they bypass the mobile networks entirely. Rather, the missives are sent through the Apple iMessage service and through RCS, the functionally equivalent technology on Google phones.\nPeople who enter their payment card data at one of these sites will be told their financial institution needs to verify the small transaction by sending a one-time passcode to the customer’s mobile device. In reality, that code will be sent by the victim’s financial institution to verify that the user indeed wishes to link their card information to a mobile wallet.\nIf the victim then provides that one-time code, the phishers will link the card data to a new mobile wallet from Apple or Google, loading the wallet onto a mobile phone that the scammers control.\nFord Merrill works in security research at SecAlliance, a CSIS Security Group company. Merrill has been studying the evolution of several China-based smishing gangs, and found that most of them feature helpful and informative video tutorials in their sales accounts on Telegram. Those videos show the thieves are loading multiple stolen digital wallets on a single mobile device, and then selling those phones in bulk for hundreds of dollars apiece.\n“Who says carding is dead?,” said Merrill, who presented about his findings at the M3AAWG security conference in Lisbon earlier today. “This is the best mag stripe cloning device ever. This threat actor is saying you need to buy at least 10 phones, and they’ll air ship them to you.”\nOne promotional video shows stacks of milk crates stuffed full of phones for sale. A closer inspection reveals that each phone is affixed with a handwritten notation that typically references the date its mobile wallets were added, the number of wallets on the device, and the initials of the seller.\nAn image from the Telegram channel for a popular Chinese smishing kit vendor shows 10 mobile phones for sale, each loaded with 4-6 digital wallets from different UK financial institutions.\nMerrill said one common way criminal groups in China are cashing out with these stolen mobile wallets involves setting up fake e-commerce businesses on Stripe or Zelle and running transactions through those entities — often for amounts totaling between $100 and $500.\nMerrill said that when these phishing groups first began operating in earnest two years ago, they would wait between 60 to 90 days before selling the phones or using them for fraud. But these days that waiting period is more like just seven to ten days, he said.\n“When they first installed this, the actors were very patient,” he said. “Nowadays, they only wait like 10 days before [the wallets] are hit hard and fast.”\nCriminals also can cash out mobile wallets by obtaining real point-of-sale terminals and using tap-to-pay on phone after phone. But they also offer a more cutting-edge mobile fraud technology: Merrill found that at least one of the Chinese phishing groups sells an Android app called “ZNFC” that can relay a valid NFC transaction to anywhere in the world. The user simply waves their phone at a local payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app relays an NFC transaction over the Internet from a phone in China.\n“The software can work from anywhere in the world,” Merrill said. “These guys provide the software for $500 a month, and it can relay both NFC enabled tap-to-pay as well as any digital wallet. The even have 24-hour support.”\nThe rise of so-called “ghost tap” mobile software was first documented in November 2024 by security experts at ThreatFabric. Andy Chandler, the company’s chief commercial officer, said their researchers have since identified a number of criminal groups from different regions of the world latching on to this scheme.\nChandler said those include organized crime gangs in Europe that are using similar mobile wallet and NFC attacks to take money out of ATMs made to work with smartphones.\n“No one is talking about it, but we’re now seeing ten different methodologies using the same modus operandi, and none of them are doing it the same,” Chandler said. “This is much bigger than the banks are prepared to say.”\nA November 2024 story in the Singapore daily The Straits Times reported authorities there arrested three foreign men who were recruited in their home countries via social messaging platforms, and given ghost tap apps with which to purchase expensive items from retailers, including mobile phones, jewelry, and gold bars.\n“Since Nov 4, at least 10 victims who had fallen for e-commerce scams have reported unauthorised transactions totaling more than $100,000 on their credit cards for purchases such as electronic products, like iPhones and chargers, and jewelry in Singapore,” The Straits Times wrote, noting that in another case with a similar modus operandi, the police arrested a Malaysian man and woman on Nov 8.\nThree individuals charged with using ghost tap software at an electronics store in Singapore. Image: The Straits Times.\nAccording to Merrill, the phishing pages that spoof the USPS and various toll road operators are powered by several innovations designed to maximize the extraction of victim data.\nFor example, a would-be smishing victim might enter their personal and financial information, but then decide the whole thing is scam before actually submitting the data. In this case, anything typed into the data fields of the phishing page will be captured in real time, regardless of whether the visitor actually clicks the “submit” button.\nMerrill said people who submit payment card data to these phishing sites often are then told their card can’t be processed, and urged to use a different card. This technique, he said, sometimes allows the phishers to steal more than one mobile wallet per victim.\nMany phishing websites expose victim data by storing the stolen information directly on the phishing domain. But Merrill said these Chinese phishing kits will forward all victim data to a back-end database operated by the phishing kit vendors. That way, even when the smishing sites get taken down for fraud, the stolen data is still safe and secure.\nAnother important innovation is the use of mass-created Apple and Google user accounts through which these phishers send their spam messages. One of the Chinese phishing groups posted images on their Telegram sales channels showing how these robot Apple and Google accounts are loaded onto Apple and Google phones, and arranged snugly next to each other in an expansive, multi-tiered rack that sits directly in front of the phishing service operator.\nThe ashtray says: You’ve been phishing all night.\nIn other words, the smishing websites are powered by real human operators as long as new messages are being sent. Merrill said the criminals appear to send only a few dozen messages at a time, likely because completing the scam takes manual work by the human operators in China. After all, most one-time codes used for mobile wallet provisioning are generally only good for a few minutes before they expire.\nNotably, none of the phishing sites spoofing the toll operators or postal services will load in a regular Web browser; they will only render if they detect that a visitor is coming from a mobile device.\n“One of the reasons they want you to be on a mobile device is they want you to be on the same device that is going to receive the one-time code,” Merrill said. “They also want to minimize the chances you will leave. And if they want to get that mobile tokenization and grab your one-time code, they need a live operator.”\nMerrill found the Chinese phishing kits feature another innovation that makes it simple for customers to turn stolen card details into a mobile wallet: They programmatically take the card data supplied by the phishing victim and convert it into a digital image of a real payment card that matches that victim’s financial institution. That way, attempting to enroll a stolen card into Apple Pay, for example, becomes as easy as scanning the fabricated card image with an iPhone.\nAn ad from a Chinese SMS phishing group’s Telegram channel showing how the service converts stolen card data into an image of the stolen card.\n“The phone isn’t smart enough to know whether it’s a real card or just an image,” Merrill said. “So it scans the card into Apple Pay, which says okay we need to verify that you’re the owner of the card by sending a one-time code.”\nHow profitable are these mobile phishing kits? The best guess so far comes from data gathered by other security researchers who’ve been tracking these advanced Chinese phishing vendors.\nIn August 2023, the security firm Resecurity discovered a vulnerability in one popular Chinese phish kit vendor’s platform that exposed the personal and financial data of phishing victims. Resecurity dubbed the group the Smishing Triad, and found the gang had harvested 108,044 payment cards across 31 phishing domains (3,485 cards per domain).\nIn August 2024, security researcher Grant Smith gave a presentation at the DEFCON security conference about tracking down the Smishing Triad after scammers spoofing the U.S. Postal Service duped his wife. By identifying a different vulnerability in the gang’s phishing kit, Smith said he was able to see that people entered 438,669 unique credit cards in 1,133 phishing domains (387 cards per domain).\nBased on his research, Merrill said it’s reasonable to expect between $100 and $500 in losses on each card that is turned into a mobile wallet. Merrill said they observed nearly 33,000 unique domains tied to these Chinese smishing groups during the year between the publication of Resecurity’s research and Smith’s DEFCON talk.\nUsing a median number of 1,935 cards per domain and a conservative loss of $250 per card, that comes out to about $15 billion in fraudulent charges over a year.\nMerrill was reluctant to say whether he’d identified additional security vulnerabilities in any of the phishing kits sold by the Chinese groups, noting that the phishers quickly fixed the vulnerabilities that were detailed publicly by Resecurity and Smith.\nAdoption of touchless payments took off in the United States after the Coronavirus pandemic emerged, and many financial institutions in the United States were eager to make it simple for customers to link payment cards to mobile wallets. Thus, the authentication requirement for doing so defaulted to sending the customer a one-time code via SMS.\nExperts say the continued reliance on one-time codes for onboarding mobile wallets has fostered this new wave of carding. KrebsOnSecurity interviewed a security executive from a large European financial institution who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\nThat expert said the lag between the phishing of victim card data and its eventual use for fraud has left many financial institutions struggling to correlate the causes of their losses.\n“That’s part of why the industry as a whole has been caught by surprise,” the expert said. “A lot of people are asking, how this is possible now that we’ve tokenized a plaintext process. We’ve never seen the volume of sending and people responding that we’re seeing with these phishers.”\nTo improve the security of digital wallet provisioning, some banks in Europe and Asia require customers to log in to the bank’s mobile app before they can link a digital wallet to their device.\nAddressing the ghost tap threat may require updates to contactless payment terminals, to better identify NFC transactions that are being relayed from another device. But experts say it’s unrealistic to expect retailers will be eager to replace existing payment terminals before their expected lifespans expire.\nAnd of course Apple and Google have an increased role to play as well, given that their accounts are being created en masse and used to blast out these smishing messages. Both companies could easily tell which of their devices suddenly have 7-10 different mobile wallets added from 7-10 different people around the world. They could also recommend that financial institutions use more secure authentication methods for mobile wallet provisioning.\nNeither Apple nor Google responded to requests for comment on this story.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Tuesday 18th of February 2025 01:37 PM \r\n         \nSounds like if person has no digital wallet = safe from this scam.\nI suspect they can make wallets as a victim with just a card by setting up a new phone account as them. :/\nI didn’t get that from the article.  The attacker is the one setting up the wallet and linking it to the card.  They are triggering 2-factor and the victim gets a message and provides the 2nd factor for the attacker to link the card to the attacker’s wallet.\nOne more reason I’m glad I only use a basic “flip phone”. Someday, I may get the rotary dial one!\nNice touch with the Wilco reference:)\nGreat article and good insights on how this is being done, and what people should look out for. However, I don’t get why the obvious smear campaign against Telegram (mentioned *5 times* in this article and captions), it’s just a great tool bad folks are abusing. But you paint it to your readers as if Telegram is somehow complicit in this fraud. Not cool.\nYour email address will not be published.

The first prevents sensitive data leakage from gen-AI applications, while the second defends against prompt engineering, preventing jailbreaks.\nAccording to the current OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 (PDF), the number one risk for gen-AI applications comes from ‘prompt injection’, while the number two risk is ‘sensitive information disclosure’ (data leakage). With large organizations each developing close to 1,000 proprietary AI apps, Pangea’s new products are designed to prevent these apps succumbing to their major risks.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt engineering is a skill. It is the art of phrasing a gen-AI query in a manner that gets the most accurate and complete response. Malicious prompt engineering is a threat. It is the skill of phrasing a prompt in a way to obtain information, or elicit responses, that either should not be disclosed or could be used in a harmful manner.\n\n\n\nPangea’s new Prompt Guard analyzes human and system prompts to detect and block jailbreak attempts or limit violations. Detection is done through heuristics, classifiers, and other techniques with, in Pangea’s announcement, ‘99% efficacy’.\n\n\n\nAI Guard is designed to prevent sensitive data leakage. It blocks malicious or undesirable content, such as profanity, hate speech, and violence. It examines prompt inputs, responses, and data ingestion from external sources to detect and block malicious content. It can prevent attempts to input false information including malware and malicious URLs, and can prevent the release of PII. \n\n\n\nIn total, AI Guard employs more than a dozen detection technologies, and can understand over 50 types of confidential and personally identifiable information. It gathers threat intelligence from partners CrowdStrike, DomainTools, and ReversingLabs.\n\n\n\n“Prompt engineering,” explains Pangea co-founder and CEO Oliver Friedrichs, “is basically social engineering on a large language model to make it do things that it has been told not to do, circumventing the controls of a typical gen-AI application.” Prompt Guard can identify all common and specialized prompt injection techniques; and if and when new techniques emerge, they will be added to the system.\n\n\n\nAI Guard goes further. “It provides prompt injection, detection and prevention,” says Friedrichs. “It also provides malicious entity detection. So, for example, if somebody is inputting a malicious URL or domain name into a prompt, or the application is generating malicious output, it can redact, block or disarm that offending content. It has a dozen different detectors for common things like profanity, sexually explicit content, self-harm, and violence, as well as code and other language. You cannot really deliver enterprise quality AI capabilities without having these security guardrails,” he adds.\n\n\n\nPangea was founded in 2021 by Friedrichs (CEO) and Sourabh Satish (CTO).

So, for example, if somebody is inputting a malicious URL or domain name into a prompt, or the application is generating malicious output, it can redact, block or disarm that offending content. It has a dozen different detectors for common things like profanity, sexually explicit content, self-harm, and violence, as well as code and other language.

The company argues this eliminates the traditional client-side attack surface — malware, malicious scripts, or compromised browser extensions — by preventing raw code or sensitive data from being exposed in the user’s environment.\n\n\n\n“Using isolation technology, MirrorTab removes the browser as an attack surface, obfuscating data, code, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to establish the most secure web sessions. This ensures that sensitive business, personal and financial information can be shared with confidence,” the company said in a statement announcing the new financing.\n\n\n\nAccording to MirrorTab advisor Allison Miller, former CISO of Reddit, the MirrorTab technology “creates a secure, bot-proof wrapper” around sensitive web sessions. The company says that even if a customer’s device is infected, the session is still isolated from malicious code,  providing an advantage that could resonate with financial services, e-commerce, and government agencies increasingly worried about client-side attacks such as Magecart or formjacking.\n\n\n\n“Browsers have become the battleground for hacking, bots, and malware,” said Brian Silverstein, CEO and founder of MirrorTab, noting that modern cyberattacks are leveraging browsers, AI and automation to evade detection, mimic human-like behavior, and execute attacks that cannot be prevented with typical web security controls.\n\n\n\nMirrorTab plans to use the seed capital to expand its platform capabilities and partnerships with existing security stacks like web application firewalls (WAFs) and bot management tools.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cybercriminals Make Millions With Ad Fraud Bot FarmAdvertisement.

The hacker claimed the theft of 400 gigabytes of data.\n\n\n\nAt the time, Finastra acknowledged the data breach, saying that the attacker compromised an internal file-transfer application used by some of its customers, but refrained from sharing information on the scope of the incident, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\n\n\nOn February 12, however, the fintech firm informed the Massachusetts Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation (OCABR) that it was sending data breach notifications to 65 Massachusetts residents, informing them that personal information was compromised in the incident.\n\n\n\nIn the notification letter, a redacted copy of which was submitted to the OCABR, Finastra reveals that, between October 31, 2024, and November 8, 2024, a threat actor accessed an internal secure file transfer platform multiple times, and that they exfiltrated certain files from the platform.\n\n\n\nThe stolen files, the company says, included personal information such as names, along with financial account information. Finastra is providing the impacted individuals with two years of free identity protection and credit monitoring services.\n\n\n\nThe company did not say how many individuals might have been affected, nor did it share other details on the cyberattack, albeit it said in November that it was not a ransomware attack and that no malware was deployed on its systems.\n\n\n\nHowever, the wording in the notification letter, and the fact that the threat actor’s post on the underground forum was deleted relatively quickly, may suggest that the company engaged in negotiations with the intruder and paid up to have the stolen information deleted.Advertisement.

It can allow a network-based attacker to take administrative control of the targeted device. \n\n\n\nThe vulnerability affects the software-based Session Smart Router, which powers Juniper’s SD-WAN solution, as well as Session Smart Conductor and WAN Assurance Managed Router. Versions 5.6.17, 6.1.12-lts, 6.2.8-lts, and 6.3.3-r2 for each of the impacted products patch the flaw. \n\n\n\nOrganizations using the affected products have been advised to update as soon as possible. The vendor noted, however, that the flaw has been automatically patched on some devices. \n\n\n\nWhile CVE-2025-21589 is a critical issue, Juniper pointed out that it was discovered during internal product security testing and the company is not aware of malicious exploitation. \n\n\n\nOn the other hand, threat actors have been known to target Session Smart Routers.

The PAN-OS authentication bypass flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to the targeted device’s management interface and execute certain PHP scripts. \n\n\n\nOn the same day, Assetnote, whose researchers discovered the issue, disclosed technical details of the vulnerability.\n\n\n\nThreat intelligence firm GreyNoise detected the first attempts to exploit CVE-2025-0108 on February 13. It’s unclear what the attackers are doing, but the company classified the activity as ‘malicious’, which indicates that threat actors are trying to exploit the vulnerability, rather than the cybersecurity community conducting tests to determine the prevalence of affected devices. \n\n\n\nAs of Tuesday, February 18, GreyNoise has seen attack attempts coming from nearly 30 unique IP addresses.\n\n\n\nPalo Alto Networks told SecurityWeek late on Monday that the security of customers is its top priority and confirmed reports of active exploitation. The company also updated its advisory early on Tuesday morning to mention in-the-wild exploitation. \n\n\n\nIn its disclosure, Assetnote pointed out that CVE-2025-0108 can be chained with a separate vulnerability — such as the actively exploited CVE-2024-9474 — for remote code execution.\n\n\n\nCVE-2024-9474 was patched in November 2024 and it has been exploited alongside CVE-2024-0012, an authentication bypass flaw that is similar to CVE-2025-0108.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nPalo Alto Networks confirmed to SecurityWeek on Monday that CVE-2025-0108 can be chained with vulnerabilities such as CVE-2024-9474, allowing unauthorized access to unpatched and unsecured firewalls. \n\n\n\nThe company noted in its updated advisory that a PoC exploit for CVE-2025-0108 is publicly available.\n\n\n\n“Palo Alto Networks has observed exploit attempts that utilize the PoC, chaining it with the exploit for CVE-2024-9474 on unpatched and unsecured PAN-OS web management interfaces,” it said.\n\n\n\nIt’s unclear if Palo Alto is referring to the exploit information released by Assetnote or a different PoC. We have seen several PoC exploits apparently designed to target CVE-2025-0108.\n\n\n\n“We are urging all customers with internet-facing PAN-OS management interfaces to immediately apply the security updates released on February 12, 2025,” Palo Alto said in an emailed statement. “Securing external-facing management interfaces is a fundamental security best practice, and we strongly encourage all organizations to review their configurations to minimize risk.”\n\n\n\nThe Shadowserver Foundation has also seen attempts to exploit CVE-2025-0108 using an unspecified, publicly available PoC. The non-profit cybersecurity organization warned that roughly 3,500 PAN-OS management interfaces had been exposed to the web as of February 14. \n\n\n\nAsked whether its disclosure of technical details may have made it easier for threat actors to exploit CVE-2025-0108, Assetnote told SecurityWeek that public disclosure was coordinated with Palo Alto Networks’ security team. The company also noted that attackers can typically reverse engineer patches fairly easily.\n\n\n\n“Our research post is in efforts to help defenders understand how the vulnerability works so they can find any intrusion attempts and, therefore, for the security community to see if there has been exploitation in the wild. Otherwise, we would all be operating in the dark,” Assetnote said.\n\n\n\nRelated: Palo Alto Networks Addresses Impact of BIOS, Bootloader Vulnerabilities on Its Firewalls\nRelated: Palo Alto Networks Patches Firewall Zero-Day Exploited for DoS Attacks\nRelated: Palo Alto Networks Patches High-Severity Vulnerability in Retired Migration Tool\n\nThe existence of CVE-2025-0108 came to light on February 12, when Palo Alto Networks announced the availability of patches and mitigations.
