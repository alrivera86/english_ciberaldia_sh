        "Content": "A subgroup within the infamous Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as\nSandworm\nhas been attributed to a multi-year initial access operation dubbed BadPilot that stretched across the globe.\n\"This subgroup has conducted globally diverse compromises of Internet-facing infrastructure to enable Seashell Blizzard to persist on high-value targets and support tailored network operations,\" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team\nsaid\nin a new report shared with The Hacker News ahead of publication.\nThe geographical spread of the initial access subgroup's targets include the whole of North America, several countries in Europe, as well as others, including Angola, Argentina, Australia, China, Egypt, India, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.\nThe development marks a significant expansion of the hacking group's victimology footprint over the past three years, which is otherwise known to be concentrated around Eastern Europe -\n2022: Energy, retail, education, consulting, and agriculture sectors in Ukraine\n2023: Sectors in the United States, Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East that provided material support to the war in Ukraine or were geopolitically significant\n2024: Entities in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom\nSandworm is tracked by Microsoft under the moniker Seashell Blizzard (formerly Iridium), and by the broader cybersecurity community under the names APT44, Blue Echidna, FROZENBARENTS, Grey Tornado, Iron Viking, Razing Ursa, Telebots, UAC-0002, and Voodoo Bear. Active since at least 2013, the group is assessed to be affiliated with Unit 74455 within the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU).\nThe adversarial collective has been\ndescribed\nby Google-owned Mandiant as an \"highly adaptive\" and \"operationally mature\" threat actor that engages in espionage, attack, and influence operations. It also has a track record of mounting\ndisruptive and destructive attacks\nagainst Ukraine over the past decade.\nCampaigns mounted by Sandworm in the wake of the Russo-Ukrainian war have leveraged data wipers (\nKillDisk\naka HermeticWiper), pseudo-ransomware (\nPrestige\naka PRESSTEA), and backdoors (\nKapeka\n), in addition to malware families that allow the threat actors to maintain\npersistent remote access\nto infected hosts via\nDarkCrystal RAT\n(aka DCRat).\nIt has also been observed relying on a variety of Russian companies and criminal marketplaces to source and sustain its offensive capabilities, highlighting a\ngrowing trend\nof cybercrime facilitating state-backed hacking.\n\"The group has used criminally sourced tools and infrastructure as a source of disposable capabilities that can be operationalized on short notice without immediate links to its past operations,\" the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\nsaid\nin an analysis.\n\"Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, APT44 has increased its use of such tooling, including malware such as DarkCrystal RAT (DCRat),\nWarzone\n, and\nRADTHIEF\n('Rhadamanthys Stealer'), and bulletproof hosting infrastructure such as that provided by the Russian-speaking actor 'yalishanda,' who advertises in cybercriminal underground communities.\"\nMicrosoft said the Sandworm subgroup has been operational since at least late 2021, exploiting various known security flaws to obtain initial access, followed by a series of post-exploitation actions aimed at collecting credentials, achieving command execution, and supporting lateral movement.\n\"Observed operations following initial access indicate that this campaign enabled Seashell Blizzard to obtain access to global targets across sensitive sectors including energy, oil and gas, telecommunications, shipping, arms manufacturing, in addition to international governments,\" the tech giant noted.\n\"This subgroup has been enabled by a horizontally scalable capability bolstered by published exploits that allowed Seashell Blizzard to discover and compromise numerous Internet-facing systems across a wide range of geographical regions and sectors.\"\nSince early last year, the sub-cluster is said to have weaponized vulnerabilities in ConnectWise ScreenConnect (\nCVE-2024-1709\n) and Fortinet FortiClient EMS (\nCVE-2023-48788\n) to infiltrate targets in the United Kingdom and the United States.\nAttacks carried out by the subgroup involve a combination of both opportunistic \"spray and pray\" attacks and targeted intrusions that are designed to maintain indiscriminate access and perform follow-on actions to either expand network access or obtain confidential information.\nIt's believed that the wide array of compromises offer Seashell Blizzard a way to meet Kremlin's ever-evolving strategic objectives, permitting the hacking outfit to horizontally scale their operations across diverse sectors as new exploits are disclosed.\nAs many as eight different known security vulnerabilities have been exploited by the subgroup to date,\nMicrosoft Exchange Server (\nCVE-2021-34473\naka ProxyShell)\nZimbra Collaboration (\nCVE-2022-41352\n)\nOpenfire (\nCVE-2023-32315\n)\nJetBrains TeamCity (\nCVE-2023-42793\n)\nMicrosoft Outlook (\nCVE-2023-23397\n)\nFortinet FortiClient EMS (\nCVE-2023-48788\n)\nConnectwise ScreenConnect (\nCVE-2024-1709\n)\nJBOSS (Unknown CVE)\nA successful foothold is succeeded by the threat actor establishing persistence through three different methods -\nFebruary 24, 2024 – present:\nDeployment of legitimate remote access software such as Atera Agent and Splashtop Remote Services, in some cases abusing the access to drop additional payloads for credential acquisition, data exfiltration, and other tools for maintaining access like OpenSSH and a bespoke utility dubbed ShadowLink that allows the compromised system to be accessible via the TOR anonymity network\nLate 2021 – present:\nDeployment of a web shell named LocalOlive that allows for command-and-control and serves as a conduit for more payloads, such as tunneling utilities (e.g., Chisel, plink, and rsockstun)\nLate 2021 – 2024:\nMalicious modifications to Outlook Web Access (OWA) sign-in pages to inject JavaScript code that can harvest and exfiltrate credentials back to the threat actor in real-time, and alter DNS A-record configurations likely in an effort to intercept credentials from critical authentication services\n\"This subgroup, which is characterized within the broader Seashell Blizzard organization by its near-global reach, represents an expansion in both the geographical targeting conducted by Seashell Blizzard and the scope of its operations,\" Microsoft said.\n\"At the same time, Seashell Blizzard's far-reaching, opportunistic access methods likely offer Russia expansive opportunities for niche operations and activities that will continue to be valuable over the medium term.\"\nThe development comes as Dutch cybersecurity company EclecticIQ linked the Sandworm group to another campaign that leverages pirated Microsoft Key Management Service (\nKMS\n) activators and fake Windows updates to deliver a new version of BACKORDER, a Go-based downloader that's responsible for fetching and executing a second-stage payload from a remote server.\nBACKORDER, per Mandiant, is usually delivered within trojanized installer files and is hard-coded to execute the original setup executable. The end goal of the campaign is to\ndeliver\nDarkCrystal RAT\n.\n\"Ukraine's heavy reliance on cracked software, including in government institutions, creates a major attack surface,\" security researcher Arda Büyükkaya\nsaid\n. \"Many users, including businesses and critical entities, have turned to\npirated software\nfrom untrusted sources, giving adversaries like Sandworm (APT44) a prime opportunity to embed malware in widely used programs.\"\nFurther infrastructure analysis has uncovered a previously undocumented RDP backdoor codenamed Kalambur that's disguised as a Windows update, and which utilizes the TOR network for command-and-control, as well as to deploy OpenSSH and enable remote access via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on port 3389.\n\"By leveraging trojanized software to infiltrate ICS environments, Sandworm (APT44) continues to demonstrate its strategic objective of destabilizing Ukraine's critical infrastructure in support of Russian geopolitical ambitions,\" Büyükkaya said.\nFound this article interesting?

Furthermore, the access can be leveraged to launch privileged containers and achieve full host compromise via the runtime Unix socket.\nWiz researchers security researchers Shir Tamari, Ronen Shustin, and Andres Riancho said their source code analysis of the container toolkit found that the file paths used during mount operations could be manipulated using a symbolic link such that it makes it possible to mount from outside the container (i.e., the root directory) into a path within \"/usr/lib64.\"\nWhile the access to the host file system afforded by the container escape is read-only, this limitation can be circumvented by interacting with the Unix sockets to spawn new privileged containers and gain unrestricted access to the file system.\n\"This elevated level of access also allowed us to monitor network traffic, debug active processes, and perform a range of other host-level operations,\" the researchers said.\nBesides updating to the latest version, users of the NVIDIA Container Toolkit are recommended to not disable the\n\"--no-cntlibs\" flag\nin production environments.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "CISOs are finding themselves more involved in AI teams, often leading the cross-functional effort and AI strategy. But there aren't many resources to guide them on what their role should look like or what they should bring to these meetings.\nWe've pulled together a framework for security leaders to help push AI teams and committees further in their AI adoption—providing them with the necessary visibility and guardrails to succeed. Meet the CLEAR framework.\nIf security teams want to play a pivotal role in their organization's AI journey, they should adopt the five steps of CLEAR to show immediate value to AI committees and leadership:\nC\n–\nCreate\nan AI asset inventory\nL\n–\nLearn\nwhat users are doing\nE\n–\nEnforce\nyour AI policy\nA\n–\nApply\nAI use cases\nR\n–\nReuse\nexisting frameworks\nIf you're looking for a solution to help take advantage of GenAI securely, check out\nHarmonic Security\n.\nAlright, let's break down the CLEAR framework.\nCreate an AI Asset Inventory\nA foundational requirement across regulatory and best-practice frameworks—including the EU AI Act, ISO 42001, and NIST AI RMF—is maintaining an AI asset inventory.\nDespite its importance, organizations struggle with manual, unsustainable methods of tracking AI tools.\nSecurity teams can take six key approaches to improve AI asset visibility:\nProcurement-Based Tracking\n– Effective for monitoring new AI acquisitions but fails to detect AI features added to existing tools.\nManual Log Gathering\n– Analyzing network traffic and logs can help identify AI-related activity, though it falls short for SaaS-based AI.\nCloud Security and DLP\n– Solutions like CASB and Netskope offer some visibility, but enforcing policies remains a challenge.\nIdentity and OAuth\n– Reviewing access logs from providers like Okta or Entra can help track AI application usage.\nExtending Existing Inventories\n– Classifying AI tools based on risk ensures alignment with enterprise governance, but adoption moves quickly.\nSpecialized Tooling\n– Continuous monitoring tools detect AI usage, including personal and free accounts, ensuring comprehensive oversight. Includes the likes of Harmonic Security.\nLearn: Shift to Proactive Identification of AI Use Cases\nSecurity teams should proactively identify AI applications that employees are using instead of blocking them outright—users will find workarounds otherwise.\nBy tracking why employees turn to AI tools, security leaders can recommend safer, compliant alternatives that align with organizational policies. This insight is invaluable in AI team discussions.\nSecond, once you know how employees are using AI, you can give better training. These training programs are going to become increasingly important amid the rollout of the EU AI Act, which mandates that organizations provide AI literacy programs:\n\"Providers and deployers of AI systems shall take measures to ensure, to their best extent, a sufficient level of AI literacy of their staff and other persons dealing with the operation and use of AI systems…\"\nEnforce an AI Policy\nMost organizations have implemented AI policies, yet enforcement remains a challenge. Many organizations opt to simply issue AI policies and hope employees follow the guidance. While this approach avoids friction, it provides little enforcement or visibility, leaving organizations exposed to potential security and compliance risks.\nTypically, security teams take one of two approaches:\nSecure Browser Controls\n– Some organizations route AI traffic through a secure browser to monitor and manage usage. This approach covers most generative AI traffic but has drawbacks—it often restricts copy-paste functionality, driving users to alternative devices or browsers to bypass controls.\nDLP or CASB Solutions\n– Others leverage existing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) investments to enforce AI policies. These solutions can help track and regulate AI tool usage, but traditional regex-based methods often generate excessive noise. Additionally, site categorization databases used for blocking are frequently outdated, leading to inconsistent enforcement.\nStriking the right balance between control and usability is key to successful AI policy enforcement.\nAnd if you need help building a GenAI policy, check out our free generator:\nGenAI Usage Policy Generator\n.\nApply AI Use Cases for Security\nMost of this discussion is about securing AI, but let's not forget that the AI team also wants to hear about cool, impactful AI use cases across the business. What better way to show you care about the AI journey than to actually implement them yourself?\nAI use cases for security are still in their infancy, but security teams are already seeing some benefits for detection and response, DLP, and email security. Documenting these and bringing these use cases to AI team meetings can be powerful – especially referencing KPIs for productivity and efficiency gains.\nReuse Existing Frameworks\nInstead of reinventing governance structures, security teams can integrate AI oversight into existing frameworks like\nNIST AI RMF\nand\nISO 42001\n.\nA practical example is\nNIST CSF 2.0\n, which now includes the \"Govern\" function, covering: Organizational AI risk management strategies Cybersecurity supply chain considerations AI-related roles, responsibilities, and policies Given this expanded scope, NIST CSF 2.0 offers a robust foundation for AI security governance.\nTake a Leading Role in AI Governance for Your Company\nSecurity teams have a unique opportunity to take a leading role in AI governance by remembering CLEAR:\nC\nreating AI asset inventories\nL\nearning user behaviors\nE\nnforcing policies through training\nA\npplying AI use cases for security\nR\neusing existing frameworks\nBy following these steps, CISOs can demonstrate value to AI teams and play a crucial role in their organization's AI strategy.\nTo learn more about overcoming GenAI adoption barriers, check out\nHarmonic Security\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "The North Korea-linked threat actor known as\nKimsuky\nhas been observed using a new tactic that involves deceiving targets into running PowerShell as an administrator and then instructing them to paste and run malicious code provided by them.\n\"To execute this tactic, the threat actor masquerades as a South Korean government official and over time builds rapport with a target before sending a spear-phishing email with an [sic] PDF attachment,\" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team\nsaid\nin a series of posts shared on X.\nTo read the purported PDF document, victims are persuaded to click a URL containing a list of steps to register their Windows system. The registration link urges them to launch PowerShell as an administrator and copy/paste the displayed code snippet into the terminal, and execute it.\nShould the victim follow through, the malicious code downloads and installs a browser-based remote desktop tool, along with a certificate file with a hardcoded PIN from a remote server.\n\"The code then sends a web request to a remote server to register the victim device using the downloaded certificate and PIN. This allows the threat actor to access the device and carry out data exfiltration,\" Microsoft said.\nThe tech giant said it observed the use of this approach in limited attacks since January 2025, describing it as a departure from the threat actor's usual tradecraft.\nIt's worth noting that the Kimsuky is not the only North Korean hacking crew to adopt the compromise strategy. In December 2024, it was\nrevealed\nthat threat actors linked to the Contagious Interview campaign are tricking users into copying and executing a malicious command on their Apple macOS systems via the Terminal app so as to address a supposed problem with accessing the camera and microphone through the web browser.\nSuch attacks, along with those that have embraced the so-called\nClickFix\nmethod, have taken off in a big way in recent months, in part driven by the fact that they rely on the targets to infect their own machines, thereby bypassing security protections.\nArizona woman pleads guilty to running laptop farm for N. Korean IT workers\nThe development comes as the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said a 48-year-old woman from the state of Arizona pleaded guilty for her role in the fraudulent\nIT worker scheme\nthat allowed North Korean threat actors to obtain remote jobs in more than 300 U.S. companies by posing as U.S. citizens and residents.\nThe activity generated over $17.1 million in illicit revenue for\nChristina Marie Chapman\nand for North Korea in violation of international sanctions between October 2020 and October 2023, the department said.\n\"Chapman, an American citizen, conspired with overseas IT workers from October 2020 to October 2023 to steal the identities of U.S. nationals and used those identities to apply for remote IT jobs and, in furtherance of the scheme, transmitted false documents to the Department of Homeland Security,\" the DoJ\nsaid\n.\n\"Chapman and her coconspirators obtained jobs at hundreds of U.S. companies, including Fortune 500 corporations, often through temporary staffing companies or other contracting organizations.\"\nThe defendant, who was arrested in May 2024, has also been accused of running a laptop farm by hosting multiple laptops at her residence to give the impression that the North Korean workers were working from within the country, when, in reality, they were based in China and Russia and remotely connected to the companies' internal systems.\n\"As a result of the conduct of Chapman and her conspirators, more than 300 U.S. companies were impacted, more than 70 identities of U.S. person were compromised, on more than 100 occasions false information was conveyed to DHS, and more than 70 U.S. individuals had false tax liabilities created in their name,\" the DoJ added.\nThe increased law enforcement scrutiny has led to an escalation of the IT worker scheme, with reports emerging of data exfiltration and extortion.\n\"After being discovered on company networks, North Korean IT workers have extorted victims by holding stolen proprietary data and code hostage until the companies meet ransom demands,\" the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nsaid\nin an advisory last month. \"In some instances, North Korean IT workers have publicly released victim companies' proprietary code.\"\nFound this article interesting?

This is aside from the\n23 flaws\nMicrosoft addressed in its Chromium-based Edge browser since the release of last month's\nPatch Tuesday update\n.\nThe update is notable for fixing two actively exploited flaws -\nCVE-2025-21391\n(CVSS score: 7.1) - Windows Storage Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\nCVE-2025-21418\n(CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\"An attacker would only be able to delete targeted files on a system,\" Microsoft said in an alert for CVE-2025-21391. \"This vulnerability does not allow disclosure of any confidential information, but could allow an attacker to delete data that could include data that results in the service being unavailable.\"\nMike Walters, president and co-founder of Action1,\nnoted\nthat the vulnerability could be chained with other flaws to escalate privileges and perform follow-on actions that can complicate recovery efforts and allow threat actors to cover up their tracks by deleting crucial forensic artifacts.\nCVE-2025-21418, on the other hand, concerns a case of privilege escalation in AFD.sys that could be exploited to achieve SYSTEM privileges.\nIt's worth noting that a similar flaw in the same component (CVE-2024-38193) was\ndisclosed\nby Gen Digital last August as being weaponized by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group. In February 2024, the tech giant also plugged a Windows kernel privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2024-21338) affecting the AppLocker driver (appid.sys) that was also exploited by the hacking crew.\nThese attack chains stand out because they go beyond a traditional Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attack by taking advantage of a security flaw in a native Windows driver, thereby obviating the need for introducing other drivers into target environments.\nIt's currently not known if the abuse of CVE-2025-21418 is linked to the Lazarus Group as well. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has\nadded\nboth the flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (\nKEV\n) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the patches by March 4, 2025.\nThe most severe of the flaws addressed by Microsoft in this month's update is\nCVE-2025-21198\n(CVSS score: 9.0), a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the High Performance Compute (HPC) Pack.\n\"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTPS request to the targeted head node or Linux compute node granting them the ability to perform RCE on other clusters or nodes connected to the targeted head node,\" Microsoft said.\nAlso worth mentioning is another RCE vulnerability (\nCVE-2025-21376\n, CVSS score: 8.1) impacting Windows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) that permits an attacker to send a specially crafted request and execute arbitrary code. However, successful exploitation of the flaw requires the threat actor to win a race condition.\n\"Given that LDAP is integral to Active Directory, which underpins authentication and access control in enterprise environments, a compromise could lead to lateral movement, privilege escalation, and widespread network breaches,\" Ben McCarthy, lead cybersecurity engineer at Immersive Labs, said.\nElsewhere, the update also resolves a NTLMv2 hash disclosure vulnerability (\nCVE-2025-21377\n, CVSS score: 6.5) that, if successfully exploited, could permit an attacker to authenticate as the targeted user.\nSoftware Patches from Other Vendors\nIn addition to Microsoft, security updates have also been released by other vendors over the past couple of weeks to rectify several vulnerabilities, including —\nAdobe\nAdvantive VeraCore\nAmazon Web Services\nAMD\nApple\nArm\nASUS\nAutomationDirect\nBosch\nCanon\nCisco\nCODESYS\nD-Link\nDell\nDevolutions Remote Desktop Manager\nDrupal\nF5\nFortinet\nGitLab\nGoogle\nAndroid\nand\nPixel\nGoogle Chrome\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Wear OS\nHMS Networks\nHP\nHP Enterprise\n(including Aruba Networking)\nIBM\nIntel\nIvanti\nJenkins\nJuniper Networks\nLenovo\nLinux distributions\nAmazon Linux\n,\nDebian\n,\nOracle Linux\n,\nRed Hat\n,\nRocky Linux\n,\nSUSE\n, and\nUbuntu\nMediaTek\nMitel\nMitsubishi Electric\nMozilla\nFirefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird\nNETGEAR\nNVIDIA\nOpenSSL\nPalo Alto Networks\nProgress Software\nQNAP\nQualcomm\nRockwell Automation\nSalesforce\nSamsung\nSAP\nSchneider Electric\nSiemens\nSolarWinds\nSonicWall\nSynology\nTrimble Cityworks\nVeeam\nVeritas\nZimbra\nZoom\n, and\nZyxel\nFound this article interesting?

However, with Ivanti appliances being\nrepeatedly weaponized\nby malicious actors, it's imperative that users take steps to apply the latest patches.\nJPCERT/CC, in a report published today, revealed that it observed\nCVE-2025-0282\n– a now-patched vulnerability affecting Ivanti Connect Secure – being exploited to deliver an updated version of the SPAWN malware framework called SPAWNCHIMERA.\n\"SPAWNCHIMERA is a malware that combines the updated functions of SPAWNANT, SPAWNMOLE, and SPAWNSNAIL into one,\" security researcher Yuma Masubuchi\nsaid\n, adding the modifications include changes to inter-process communication to use UNIX domain sockets and a function to plug the security defect in an attempt to prevent other actors from exploiting it.\nIvanti also acknowledged that its edge products have been \"targeted and exploited by sophisticated threat actor attacks\" and that it's making efforts to improve its software, implement secure-by-design principles, and raise the bar for potential abuse by adversaries.\n\"While these products are not the ultimate target, they are increasingly the route that well-resourced nation state groups are focusing their effort on to attempt espionage campaigns against extremely high-value organizations,\" Ivanti CSO Daniel Spicer\nsaid\n.\n\"We have enhanced internal scanning, manual exploitation and testing capabilities, increased collaboration and information sharing with the security ecosystem, and further enhanced our responsible disclosure process, including becoming a CVE Numbering Authority.\"\nThe development comes as Bishop Fox\nreleased\nfull technical details of a now-patched security flaw in SonicWall SonicOS (\nCVE-2024-53704\n) that could be exploited to bypass authentication in firewalls and allow attackers to hijack active SSL VPN sessions in order to gain unauthorized access.\nAs of February 7, 2025, nearly 4,500 internet-facing SonicWall SSL VPN servers remain unpatched against CVE-2024-53704.\nIn a similar move, Akamai has\npublished\nits discovery of two vulnerabilities in Fortinet FortiOS (\nCVE-2024-46666\nand\nCVE-2024-46668\n) that an unauthenticated attacker can exploit to achieve denial-of-service (DoS) and remote code execution. The flaws were resolved by Fortinet on January 14, 2025.\nFortinet has since also\nrevised\nits advisory for\nCVE-2024-55591\nto highlight another flaw tracked as\nCVE-2025-24472\n(CVSS score: 8.1) that could result in an authentication bypass in FortiOS and FortiProxy devices via a specially crafted CSF proxy request.\nThe company credited watchTowr Labs researcher Sonny Macdonald for discovering and reporting the flaw. It's worth noting that the vulnerability has already been patched alongside CVE-2024-55591, meaning no customer action is required if fixes for the latter have already been applied.\nBoth CVEs cover the same vulnerability but on a different endpoint,\" Benjamin Harris, CEO of watchTowr, told The Hacker News. \"There is one management interface, however this management interface has effectively three sub interfaces.\n\"The original CVE-2024-55591 vulnerability was scoped to an authentication bypass in only one of these sub interfaces. The 'new' CVE that was disclosed yesterday reflects the same authentication bypass in a different sub interface. The root cause is the same and the same patch resolves CVE-2025-24472\n(The story was updated after publication to include a response from watchTowr Labs.)\nFound this article interesting?

However, it it recommends that users install the security updates as soon as possible.\nThe three critical security vulnerabilities Ivanti patched are the following:\nCVE-2025-22467\n: Stack-based buffer overflow in ICS allows remote authenticated attackers with low privileges to execute code. (critical severity score of 9.9)\nCVE-2024-38657\n: External control of a filename enables remote authenticated attackers to perform arbitrary file writing in ICS and IPS. (critical severity score of 9.1)\nCVE-2024-10644\n: Code injection vulnerability enables remote authenticated attackers remote code execution in ICS and IPS. (critical severity score of 9.1)\nExploiting any of the three issues is possible from a remote location but an attacker needs to be authenticated. Furthermore, for two of them admin privileges are necessary to achieve remote code execution or to write arbitrary files.\nDespite this, the risk is still considerable as insider threats or attackers who have stolen credentials via phishing, previous breaches, or via brute forcing passwords, can still leverage the flaws for malicious operations.\nThere are also five more flaws included in the bulletin, ranging from medium to high severity. Issues include cross-site scripting (XSS) issues, hardcoded keys, cleartext storage of sensitive data, and insufficient permissions.\nThe vulnerabilities impact ICS 22.7R2.5 and older, IPS 22.7R1.2 and older, and ISAC 22.7R4 and below. Details about which products are impacted by each flaw can be seen in the table below.\nThe issues were addressed in ICS version 22.7R2.6, IPS version 22.7R1.3, and ISAC 22.8R1, which are the recommended upgrade targets for system administrators.\nIvanti has also acknowledged that the issue also impacts Pulse Connect Secure 9.x, but stated it does not plan to offer fixes for these products as their support period has ended,\n“The Pulse Connect Secure 9.x version of the product reached End of Engineering June 2024 and has reached End-of-Support as of December 31, 2024,”\nIvanti explains\n.\n“Because of this, the 9.x version of Connect Secure no longer receives backported fixes,” the company added, encouraging customers to upgrade to version 22.7 of Ivanti Connect Secure.\nIvanti has not provided any mitigations for the patched flaws and applying the latest update is the recommended solution.\nRelated Articles:\nOver 12,000 KerioControl firewalls exposed to exploited RCE flaw\nHackers exploit Cityworks RCE bug to breach Microsoft IIS servers\nNetgear warns users to patch critical WiFi router vulnerabilities\nLaravel admin package Voyager vulnerable to one-click RCE flaw\nQNAP fixes six Rsync vulnerabilities in NAS backup, recovery app"

        "Content": "While the first article outlined\nwhy VPNs are risky and cloud-based RDP is a superior alternative\n, this article will take a closer look at what makes TruGrid SecureRDP the best choice for modern businesses.\nWe'll explore how it simplifies deployment, enhances security, and ensures compliance—all while eliminating the complexity of VPNs.\nSimplified Deployment and Management: Less Complexity, More Control\nDeploying and managing a VPN is often complex and time-consuming, particularly for organizations with large, distributed workforces.\nVPNs require complicated configuration for end users, and are often difficult to use because of multiple steps required to establish connectivity, all of which can lead to lost productivity.\nCloud-Based RDP Simplicity & Flexibility\nCloud-based RDP solutions, like those offered by TruGrid, simplify the deployment process by offering centralized management through a single dashboard. This allows IT administrators to control user access, manage security policies, and monitor usage from one location.\nTruGrid Management & Security Capabilities\nManage MFA: TruGrid enables the\nmanagement of MFA\nfor Active Directory users, with options to reset or disable MFA across domains. This is done via the Security Management section of the dashboard, offering a clear, user-friendly interface for managing MFA settings, which include disabling or resetting MFA for selected users.\nNote: TruGrid does not recommend ever turning off MFA!  For those using Microsoft Entra ID, TruGrid supports the use of Microsoft Entra MFA.\nFigure 1: MFA Management\nGeo-Blocking: Despite eliminating RDP exposure, Administrators can\nrestrict countries where end users can SIGN IN from\nby enabling the Geo-Blocking feature of TruGrid and adding trusted countries.\nFigure 2: Managing Geo-Blocking\nTruGrid RemoteApp (Role-based App Access): TruGrid allows admins to\nenable RemoteApp and allow access to just required apps\n.\nThis prevents the need to allow end users to access entire remote desktop, thereby further reducing the attack surface even for authorized users. This is achieved via the Resource Assignment – App section.\nFigure 3: Allowing Access to Specific Applications via TruGrid RemoteApp Feature\nTruGrid Supports BYOD\nWhile security-conscious organizations will never allow BYOD devices to use VPN to connect to the corporate network (for fear of malware-traversal over unmanaged (BYOD) devices), cloud-based RDP solutions such as TruGrid are device-agnostic, allowing users to connect from any device without any possibility of malware traversal between any device and the corporate network.\n\"The State of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policies and Trends\" report from Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) indicates that 70% of organizations allow certain personas, like IT and executives, to choose their devices, highlighting the growing reliance on BYOD.\nThe 73% of organizations that give IT personnel device choice and 54% for executives, reflect the need for flexible, yet secure access solutions. Cloud-based RDP provides a secure and simple solution for organizations with BYOD policies, ensuring secure remote access regardless of device type.\nOrganizations relying on VPN are prone to cyberattacks over BYOD devices since BYOD devices (not owned by the organization) can contain malware or other cyber threats that can spread from the BYOD devices to the corporate network.\nFigure 4: Most Organizations Allow for Some Sort of BYOD for Certain Users\nSecure and Simplify Remote Access with TruGrid SecureRDP\nTraditional VPNs expose networks to security risks, require complex configurations, and make compliance difficult. TruGrid SecureRDP eliminates these challenges with a fully managed, cloud-based RDP solution that requires no open firewall ports.\nWith built-in MFA, Geo-Blocking, and a Zero Trust framework, TruGrid simplifies remote access while ensuring enterprise-grade security.\nTry a Business Plan for Free\nCompliance and Governance: Stay Secure and Compliant\nWith increasing regulatory pressure, businesses must ensure compliance with standards such as HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI-DSS. VPNs, with their complex infrastructure, make auditing and monitoring difficult, leading to potential compliance issues. Cloud-based RDP offers\nenhanced compliance features\ncompared to VPNs.\nCloud-Based RDP Compliance Features\nCloud-based RDP solutions simplify compliance by providing granular logging and built-in auditing tools. They also support cyber insurance requirements, which increasingly demand secure, no-firewall exposure solutions for remote access. This makes it easier for businesses to demonstrate compliance with standards like SOC 2, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.\nThe \"Managing the Endpoint Vulnerability Gap\" report by Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) further reinforces the compliance benefits of cloud-based RDP. The report finds that 44% of organizations uncovered systems with open access and 37% identified compliance issues during endpoint monitoring.\nCloud-based RDP eliminates risks posed by vulnerable endpoints (BYOD and corporate) because it connects endpoints to corporate networks in a zero-trust fashion, whereby threats from remote endpoints cannot traverse into the corporate network.\nFigure 5: Majority Have Experienced Attacks Relating to Device Management\n????\nDirect Comparison: VPN vs. Cloud-Based RDP\nFor many industries, especially healthcare, finance, and technology, where security and compliance are paramount, cloud-based RDP offers a superior solution when compared with RDP over VPN.\nCloud-based RDP ensures secure, scalable, and high-performance access to critical applications without exposing the entire network.\nFeature\nVPN\nCloud-Based RDP\nSecurity\nRequires open inbound firewall ports\nNo open inbound firewall ports, Zero Trust\nPerformance\nHigher latency, network congestion\nLow-latency, load distribution\nCost\nHigh upfront and ongoing costs\nPay-as-you-go, scalable\nManagement\nComplex setup and management\nSimplified and centralized\nCompliance\nExposed inbound ports create compliance headache\nZero exposure, integrated MFA, support for Geo Blocking and Conditional Access, help meet compliance\nTable 1: VPN vs. Cloud-Based RDP Feature Comparison\nConclusion\nAs businesses continue to adapt to a distributed workforce, the security, performance, and cost limitations of VPNs are becoming more evident.\nCloud-based RDP solutions like\nTruGrid SecureRDP\nprovide a secure, scalable, and cost-efficient alternative, making them the superior choice for modern remote access needs.\nGrowing cyber threats underscore the urgency for businesses to adopt zero-trust solutions like cloud-based RDP.\nDon't wait until your next cybersecurity audit or breach—\nschedule personalized demo with TruGrid\nand take the first step towards a secure remote access future.\nSponsored and written by\nTruGrid\n."

        "Content": "Google has fixed two vulnerabilities that, when chained together, could expose the email addresses of YouTube accounts, causing a massive privacy breach for those using the site anonymously.\nThe flaws\nwere discovered\nby security researchers Brutecat (\nbrutecat.com\n) and Nathan (\nschizo.org\n), who found that YouTube and Pixel Recorder APIs could be used to obtain user's Google Gaia IDs and convert them into their email addresses.\nThe ability to convert a YouTube channel into an owner's email address is a significant privacy risk to content creators, whistleblowers, and activists relying on being anonymous online.\nLeaky APIs\nThe first part of the attack chain, which was exploitable for months, was discovered after BruteCat looked through Google's\nInternal People API\nand found that Google's network-wide \"blocking\" feature required an obfuscated Gaia ID and a display name.\nA Gaia ID is a unique internal identifier Google uses to manage accounts across its network of sites. As users register for a single \"Google Account\" that is used across all of Google's sites, this ID is the same throughout Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, and other Google services.\nHowever, this ID is not meant to be public and is for internal use to share data between Google's systems.\nPlaying around with the blocking feature on YouTube, BruteCat discovered that when attempting to block someone in a live chat, YouTube exposes the targeted person's obfuscated Gaia ID in a response from the\n/youtube/v1/live_chat/get_item_context_menu\nAPI request.\nThe response included base64 encoded data that, when decoded, contained the Gaia ID of that user.\nResponse from the YouTube API\nThe researchers found that simply clicking on the three-dot menu in a chat triggered a background request to YouTube's API, allowing them to access the ID without having to block them. By modifying the API call, the researchers retrieved the Gaia ID of any YouTube channel, including those attempting to remain anonymous.\nArmed with the Gaia ID, they now wanted to figure out a way to convert it into an email address, which would increase the flaw's severity.\nHowever, older APIs that\ncould do this\nhave been deprecated or no longer work, so BruteCat and Nathan began looking for old, outdated Google services that could potentially still be exploited.\nAfter experimenting, Nathan discovered that\nPixel Recorder\nhas a web-based API that could be used to convert the ID into an email when sharing a recording.\nUsing Pixel Recorder API to convert Gaia ID to an email address\nThis meant that once a YouTube user's Gaia ID was obtained, it could be submitted to the Pixel Recorder sharing feature, which then returned the associated email address, potentially compromising the identity of millions of YouTube users.\n\"Gaia IDs are leaked across several Google products apart from just YouTube (Maps, Play, Pay), causing a significant privacy risk for all Google users, as they can be used to reveal the email address tied to the Google account,\" the researchers told BleepingComputer.\nWhile the researchers now had a way of getting an email address from Gaia ID, the service also notified the users of the shared file, potentially alerting them of the malicious activity.\nAs the notification email included a video's title in the email notification, the researchers modified their request to include millions of characters in the title data, which caused the email notification service to fail and not send the email.\nThe researchers disclosed the flaw to Google on September 24th, 2024, and it was ultimately fixed last week on February 9th, 2025.\nGoogle initially responded that the vulnerability was a duplicate of a previously tracked bug, only awarding a $3,133 bounty. However, after demonstrating the additional Pixel Recorder component, they increased the bounty to $10,633, citing a high likelihood that it would be exploited.\nBruteCat and Nathan told BleepingComputer that Google mitigated the bugs by fixing the Gaia ID leak and the Gaia ID to Email flaw via Pixel Recorder. Google also made it so blocking a user on YouTube only impacted that site and would not affect other services.\nGoogle has confirmed to BleepingComputer that mitigations for the bugs are now completed and that there are no signs that any attacker actively exploited the flaws.\nRelated Articles:\nGoogle says hackers abuse Gemini AI to empower their attacks\nGoogle blocked 2.36 million risky Android apps from Play Store in 2024\nGoogle to kill Chrome Sync on older Chrome browser versions\nGoogle launches customizable Web Store for Enterprise extensions\nNew Android Identity Check locks settings outside trusted locations"

The move is a continuation of a barrage of law-enforcement actions against the Russia-based cybercriminal organization.\nThe Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the United Kingdom's Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office jointly sanctioned Zservers, based in Barnaul, Russia, for enabling \"ransomware attacks and other criminal activity,\" the Treasury Department revealed in a press release Feb. 11. That illicit activity specifically centers on providing the infrastructure to facilitate attacks by LockBit, a prolific Russian-based ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group, according to the release.\nThe latest sanctions against Zservers are a continuation of multinational law-enforcement actions aimed at putting LockBit — which has committed severely disruptive ransomware attacks against numerous global organizations — permanently out of commission.\nSpecifically, they follow four LockBit-related arrests and device seizures made in October by Europol and Eurojust, which at the time also sanctioned and named as a LockBit affiliate Aleksandr Ryzhenkov (aka Beverley). Ryzhenkov was once second-in-command for the infamous Evil Corp cybercrime organization. Officials also arrested one of LockBit's lead developers in Israel last August, while a separate action by Australia sanctioned LockBit's head honcho, LockBitSupp (aka Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev), in May 2024.\nRelated:India's Cybercrime Problems Grow as Nation Digitizes\n\"Ransomware actors and other cybercriminals rely on third-party network service providers like Zservers to enable their attacks on Us and international critical infrastructure,\" Bradley T. Smith, the Treasury Department's acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a press statement. The sanctions demonstrate the US government's \"collective resolve to disrupt all aspects of this criminal ecosystem, wherever located, to protect our national security,\" he added.\nLaw enforcement investigating LockBit discovered the criminal activity of Zservers after the company advertised its BPH services on known cybercriminal forums, according to the Treasury Department. BPH service providers sell access to specialized servers and other computer infrastructure designed to evade detection and thus defy law enforcement attempts to disrupt malicious activities.\nRelated:Drata Acquires SafeBase to Strengthen GRC Portfolio\nAllegedly, Zservers has provided BPH services, including leasing numerous IP addresses, to LockBit affiliates, who have used the hosting services to coordinate and launch ransomware attacks, according to international law enforcement, which collected evidence over several years to come to this conclusion.\nDuring a 2022 search of a known LockBit affiliate, Canadian law enforcement uncovered a laptop operating a virtual machine connected to a Zservers' subleased IP address and running a programming interface used to operate LockBit malware. Also that year, a Russian cybercriminal purchased IP addresses from Zservers, which the department said was likely for use to power LockBit chat servers to discuss ransomware operations. In 2023, Zservers also leased infrastructure, including a Russian IP address, to a LockBit affiliate, the department said.\nThe idea behind government sanctions is to prohibit companies in certain countries from doing business with people involved in cybercriminal activity with the aim of deterring that activity. However, given the resilience of professional ransomware and other cybercriminal groups, experts have mixed opinions on whether this strategy actually works in the long run.\nRelated:CISA Places Election Security Staffers on Leave\n\"It is important to acknowledge that although sanctions might impede ransomware operations by targeting their infrastructure, ransomware groups such as LockBit are highly adaptive and well-connected, and will likely have other providers they're able to call on,\" says Andrew Costis, engineering manager of the Adversary Research Team at security firm AttackIQ.\nHowever, sanctions should make it more difficult for cybercriminals to operate by increasing their costs and forcing attackers to find less effective methods to commit ransomware attacks, another security expert says. This can serve to at least slow them down if not totally put them out of service, notes Randolph Barr, CISO at security firm Cequence.\n\"The recently announced sanctions and law enforcement actions against Zservers will aid in disrupting ransomware groups by targeting their infrastructure, seizing servers, and blocking financial transactions,\" he says.\nStill, sanctions alone may not necessarily disrupt LockBit and other ransomware groups entirely, meaning that organizations must remain vigilant, Barr says. \"As threat actors adapt, companies must continue improving incident management and include ransomware scenarios in their preparedness exercises,\" he notes.\nIndeed, Costis says, given the adaptability of RaaS and its network of affiliates in particular, \"organizations must stay vigilant and focus on the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attackers deploy, to stay ahead of ever-changing threats.\"\nElizabeth Montalbano, Contributing Writer\n\nElizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer, journalist, and therapeutic writing mentor with more than 25 years of professional experience.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nSandworm (aka Seashell Blizzard) has an initial access wing called \"BadPilot\" that uses standard intrusion tactics to spread Russia's tendrils around the world.\nFebruary 12, 2025\nArguably, no advanced persistent threat (APT) enjoys as much notoriety as Sandworm, otherwise known as Military Unit 74455 within Russia's military intelligence (GRU). Its highlight reel includes NotPetya, an attack against the 2018 Winter Olympics, and two effective assaults on Ukraine's power grid. More recent activities include a campaign against Denmark's energy sector and an unsuccessful attempt to down Ukraine's grid for a third time, followed by a successful attempt.\nIn a sign of the times, Sandworm has subtly been shifting toward quieter, more widespread intrusions. Microsoft, which tracks the group as \"Seashell Blizzard,\" has identified a subgroup within 74455 focused solely on gaining initial access to high-value organizations across major industries and geographic regions. It calls this subgroup \"BadPilot.\"\nSince at least late 2021, BadPilot has been performing opportunistic attacks against Internet-facing infrastructure, taking advantage of known vulnerabilities in popular email and collaboration platforms. Notable examples include Zimbra's CVE-2022-41352, the Microsoft Exchange bug CVE-2021-34473, and CVE-2023-23397 in Microsoft Outlook. All three of these vulnerabilities received \"critical\" 9.8 out of 10 scores in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).\nBadPilot uses these critical vulnerabilities to gain useful initial access to traditionally high-value organizations: telecommunications companies, oil and gas companies, shipping companies, arms manufacturers, and entities of foreign governments. Targets have ranged from Ukraine and broader Europe to Central and South Asia and the Middle East.\nSince early 2024, BadPilot has expanded to access targets in the US and UK as well. For this, it has made particular use of bugs in remote monitoring and management software: CVE-2023-48788, for example, a remote injection opportunity in the Fortinet Forticlient Enterprise Management Server (EMS), and the rare 10 out of 10 CVSS-rated CVE-2024-1709, allowing for authentication bypass in ScreenConnect by ConnectWise.\nAfter gaining its foothold on a targeted system, BadPilot follows all the usual steps of any average hacking operation. It promptly establishes persistence using its custom \"LocalOlive\" Web shell, as well as copies of legitimate remote management and monitoring (RMM) tools, or \"ShadowLink,\" which configures compromised systems as Tor hidden services. It collects credentials, performs lateral movement, exfiltrates data as necessary, and sometimes performs further post-compromise activities.\n\"There is not a lack of sophistication here, but a focus on agility and obtaining goals,\" says Sherrod DeGrippo, director of threat intelligence strategy at Microsoft. \"These TTPs work because this threat actor is persistent and continues pursuing its objectives.\"\nUltimately, BadPilot's job is to lubricate more significant attacks by its parent group, and, by extension, empower its controlling government. While a lot of its activity seems opportunistic, Microsoft wrote, \"its compromises cumulatively offer Seashell Blizzard options when responding to Russia's evolving strategic objectives.\"\nIt may or may not be a coincidence, for example, that the group came into being just months before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As that war began, and Russia peppered its neighbor with more cyberattacks than ever before, BadPilot was right in the mix, helping gain access to organizations perceived to be providing political or military support to its adversary. Additionally, Microsoft says, the group has enabled at least three destructive attacks in Ukraine since 2023.\nSandworm has targeted critical infrastructure across Ukraine since the war started, including telecommunications infrastructure, manufacturing plants, transportation and logistics, energy, water, military and government organizations, and other infrastructure meant to support the civilian population. It has also targeted military communities for the purpose of intelligence gathering.\n\"These threat actors are persistent, creative, organized, and well-resourced,\" DeGrippo emphasizes. For this reason, \"Critical sectors need to ensure that they sustain above-average security practices, patch their software, monitor Internet-facing assets, and enhance their overall security posture.\"\nNate Nelson, Contributing Writer\n\nNate Nelson is a writer based in New York City.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nWhen it comes to keeping patient information safe, people empowerment is just as necessary as deploying new technologies.\nFebruary 12, 2025\nCOMMENTARY\nSome say artificial intelligence (AI) has changed healthcare in ways we couldn't have imagined just a few years ago. It's now used for everything from paperwork to helping doctors make better diagnoses. But like any new tech, there are risks involved.\nCurrently, AI is both a potent defense mechanism and an attacker enabler. Therefore, the question that must be asked is clear: Is AI an enemy or a friend of cybersecurity in healthcare? Honestly, the answer is both.\nHealthcare systems are rich targets for malicious actors, with considerable protected health information (PHI) spread across interconnected assets such as electronic health records, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled medical devices, and telehealth platforms. It has been proven that traditional cybersecurity tools often lack the resources and features required to protect such complex ecosystems and, as in different industries, struggle to keep pace with both the volume of data being generated and evolving attack methodologies.\nThe advantage of machine learning algorithms is that they can find a potential threat before it is serious. AI-powered security tools can detect anomalies in system behaviors, such as unauthorized data transfer or suspicious login activities, and thus proactively prevent a breach. Indeed, several hospitals using AI-powered systems have been able to avert ransomware attacks and maintain operational integrity and patient safety.\nArtificial Intelligence is also incomparable in terms of its critical role in reducing administrative burdens and further complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other regulations. AI-powered tools, such as virtual assistants and data processing systems, take over administrative work while safeguarding sensitive data. These tools protect PHI and free human resources to focus on patient care.\nWhile AI hardens the defense, it turbocharges the attacker side, too. In such a way, cyber threats in healthcare have become increasingly sophisticated. The game changed with generative AI tools that let attackers create unbelievably realistic tailor-made emails with perfect grammar and formatting that quickly slipped through traditional security filters.\nDeepfakes add another layer to these deceptions: generating hyperreal audio and video that makes an attacker sound like senior health leaders or other trusted voices. These fabrications have been used to deceive staff into granting unauthorized access, sharing PHI, and even making fraudulent financial transactions. In some cases, attackers have used deepfakes to spread false medical information or to undermine public confidence, further destabilizing an already complex threat landscape.\nAI-powered malware leverages machine learning to make live changes, evade traditional detection, and zero in on critical systems, such as IoT-enabled devices and electronic health records. Attackers manipulate diagnostic data, alter medical imaging, and gain entry through vulnerabilities in lightly secured IoT devices, enabling them to create avenues to coordinate attacks. Combining AI with IoT could pose a greater threat to patient safety and trust in healthcare systems than just financial losses. \nAI-powered threats sound an alarm for information security, IT, and healthcare leaders. These risks are reshaping the cybersecurity landscape. Preemptive defenses require advanced AI tools, employee training, and collaboration across cross-functional teams. This would, in turn, involve policy and detection system reviews to grant top priority for countering AI-impelled social engineering and malware. Constantly being one step ahead of the bad actors requires constant vigilance, innovative thinking, and a core commitment to data safety and patient care.\nAs an expert or executive, you face the critical decision of managing the promise of AI and the risk it further introduces into an already overcomplicated cybersecurity landscape. AI is not the Holy Grail; it's a tool that can be used for and against us. AI’s transformative potential in healthcare and security comes from how it is implemented, so leaders must approach its adoption with a balanced perspective. They should be excited yet cautious, knowing full well that attackers are leveraging the very same technology to undermine our systems, data, and trust.\nIn my experience, the excitement around adopting AI tools like transcript generators, grammar checkers, or automated note-taking systems often takes precedence over critical security assessments. I have seen teams advocate for rapid implementation to save time and resources without assessing the risks; common questions such as where the data is stored, how it is processed, or if the vendor is compliant often are not asked. This rush to embrace convenience creates gaps that attackers can exploit, especially in healthcare, where even minor oversights can lead to significant breaches of PHI or personally identifiable information (PII).\nDeepfakes, adaptive malware, and the exploitation of IoT devices, all powered by AI, require a new type of thinking to address these threats — one that changes from legacy defenses or even leading-edge AI-powered tools to placing those tools within an extended proactive security framework encompassing audits, employee training, and reliable governance. For that to happen, health workers and administrators must be empowered to recognize sophisticated attacks, faked video calls, or some other unexpected data transfer AI flagged up. People empowerment is just as necessary in deploying new technologies.\nDrive collaboration between IT, security, and clinical teams in developing customized strategies for technical vulnerabilities and operational realities. This means vigilance, from systems monitoring to continuing review of AI's evolving role in your institution.\nSafeguarding healthcare systems includes protecting the trust and well-being of the patients it cares for and its entire community. This depends entirely on the type of leadership that doesn't just react to threats but proactively takes bold measures to mitigate risks before they spread. Security embedded in all facets of the organization should ensure continuity of critical operations and uncompromised care of the patients by leaders in healthcare.\nClaudio Gallo\nLead Security Engineer, C4HCO\nClaudio Gallo is a lead security engineer of the Colorado Marketplace Exchange, dedicated to protecting critical information in the healthcare and insurance industries.

We help you gain critical insights and make more informed decisions across your business priorities.\nBreaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa and the Asia Pacific\nMore than half of attacks on Indian businesses come from outside the country, while 45% of those targeting consumers come from Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos.\nFebruary 12, 2025\nIndia continues to see a surge in cybercrime affecting both citizens and businesses, with cyber fraud against citizens jumping 51% over the past year and cyberattackers targeting businesses in volumes significantly higher than global averages.\nOverall, Indian citizens filed more than 1.7 million cybercrime complaints in 2024, up from 1.1 million complaints in 2023, according to the latest data from India's National Cyber Reporting Platform (NCRP) released in early February. While many of those cyber scams came from domestic sources, about 45% of the cyberattacks came from cybercriminal havens in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos, according to the report.\nThe problem underscores the dark side of increasing access to online services. While the country is digitizing many of its government services — giving citizens easier access — crime has followed online, President Droupadi Murmu said during a speech to Parliament on Jan. 31.\n\"[I]n an increasingly digital society, cybersecurity has become a crucial issue of national importance,\" Murmu said. \"Digital fraud, cybercrime, and emerging technologies like deepfakes pose challenges to our social, economic, and national security.\"\nIndia's citizens are not the only targets of cybercriminals — business sites increasingly face online attacks. Cyber-risks and digital/technology risks are the most pressing concerns for companies in India, with businesses in the region prioritizing those issues more than their global counterparts, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers' \"2025 Global Digital Trust Insights — India Edition.\"\n\nSource: PricewaterhouseCoopers, \"2025 Global Digital Trust Insights — India Edition\"\n\"Over the next 12 months, Indian organizations are prioritizing the mitigation of three key risks: cyberthreats, digital vulnerabilities and inflation,\" PwC India stated in the report. \"This focus highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity, reliable technological infrastructure, and strategies to counter rising costs and ensure resilience and sustained growth.\"\nCompared with other regions of the world, India is seeing a greater volume of attacks. The average website in India sees about 6.9 million unwanted requests — often referred to as \"attacks\" by vendors — every year, with 26% more attacks per site compared with the global average, according to Indusface. Denial-of-service attacks are also more common against Indian targets, compared with the global average, says Venky Sundar, founder and president for the Americas at Indusface.\nThe threat actors have gone mobile-first, with API servers for mobile applications targeted with 43% more requests per host compared with websites, he says.\nThere is \"a shift in attack strategies towards disrupting mobile and connected services,\" Sundar says. \"Cybercrime is increasingly targeting external-facing APIs associated with mobile apps rather than just traditional web platforms.\"\nThe attacks are split fairly evenly between domestic sources and global ones, he adds. Overall, about half of the malicious traffic targeting company sites and API servers are domestic, with much of the rest coming from four countries: US, France, UK, and Singapore.\nThe government is currently taking steps to make life harder for attackers. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), for example, has created exclusive Internet domains for banks (bank.in) and for non-bank financial institutions (fin.in), which will be run by the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT). India also passed its first privacy and data-protection law in 2023, and drafted implementation rules last month, which together define the rights of Indian citizens and requirements for companies handling data.\nIndia and the US also recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that allows the two countries to cooperate on intelligence gathering, the exchange of information on cybercrime cases, and collaborative training. India has also fought to rescue and repatriate its citizens from forced labor camps for criminal syndicates in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos, where they are forced to conduct a variety of online scams.\nYet the country still faces a shortage of cybersecurity professionals. In September, the government announced an effort to train 5,000 \"cyber commandos\" over the next five years, to help national and state governments with cyber investigations.\nTraining citizens in cybersecurity can have additional benefits, President Murmu said in her remarks to Parliament.\n\"My government has taken numerous measures to control these cyber threats, creating opportunities for employment in the field of cybersecurity for the youth [and] is continuously working to ensure competence in cybersecurity,\" she said, noting that the country has reached Tier 1 status in the International Telecommunication Union's Global Cybersecurity Index.\nRead more about:\nRobert Lemos, Contributing Writer\n\nVeteran technology journalist of more than 20 years.

        "Content": "Microsoft today issued security updates to fix at least 56 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and supported software, including two zero-day flaws that are being actively exploited.\n\nAll supported Windows operating systems will receive an update this month for a buffer overflow vulnerability that carries the catchy name CVE-2025-21418. This patch should be a priority for enterprises, as Microsoft says it is being exploited, has low attack complexity, and no requirements for user interaction.\nTenable senior staff research engineer Satnam Narang noted that since 2022, there have been nine elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in this same Windows component — three each year — including one in 2024 that was exploited in the wild as a zero day (CVE-2024-38193).\n“CVE-2024-38193 was exploited by the North Korean APT group known as Lazarus Group to implant a new version of the FudModule rootkit in order to maintain persistence and stealth on compromised systems,” Narang said. “At this time, it is unclear if CVE-2025-21418 was also exploited by Lazarus Group.”\nThe other zero-day, CVE-2025-21391, is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Storage that could be used to delete files on a targeted system. Microsoft’s advisory on this bug references something called “CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access,” says no user interaction is required, and that the attack complexity is low.\nAdam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7, said although the advisory provides scant detail, and even offers some vague reassurance that ‘an attacker would only be able to delete targeted files on a system,’ it would be a mistake to assume that the impact of deleting arbitrary files would be limited to data loss or denial of service.\n“As long ago as 2022, ZDI researchers set out how a motivated attacker could parlay arbitrary file deletion into full SYSTEM access using techniques which also involve creative misuse of symbolic links,”Barnett wrote.\nOne vulnerability patched today that was publicly disclosed earlier is CVE-2025-21377, another weakness that could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges on a vulnerable Windows system. Specifically, this is yet another Windows flaw that can be used to steal NTLMv2 hashes — essentially allowing an attacker to authenticate as the targeted user without having to log in.\nAccording to Microsoft, minimal user interaction with a malicious file is needed to exploit CVE-2025-21377, including selecting, inspecting or “performing an action other than opening or executing the file.”\n“This trademark linguistic ducking and weaving may be Microsoft’s way of saying ‘if we told you any more, we’d give the game away,'” Barnett said. “Accordingly, Microsoft assesses exploitation as more likely.”\nThe SANS Internet Storm Center has a handy list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity. Windows enterprise administrators would do well to keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the scoop on any patches causing problems.\nIt’s getting harder to buy Windows software that isn’t also bundled with Microsoft’s flagship Copilot artificial intelligence (AI) feature. Last month Microsoft started bundling Copilot with Microsoft Office 365, which Redmond has since rebranded as “Microsoft 365 Copilot.” Ostensibly to offset the costs of its substantial AI investments, Microsoft also jacked up prices from 22 percent to 30 percent for upcoming license renewals and new subscribers.\nOffice-watch.com writes that existing Office 365 users who are paying an annual cloud license do have the option of “Microsoft 365 Classic,” an AI-free subscription at a lower price, but that many customers are not offered the option until they attempt to cancel their existing Office subscription.\nIn other security patch news, Apple has shipped iOS 18.3.1, which fixes a zero day vulnerability (CVE-2025-24200) that is showing up in attacks.\nAdobe has issued security updates that fix a total of 45 vulnerabilities across InDesign, Commerce, Substance 3D Stager, InCopy, Illustrator, Substance 3D Designer and Photoshop Elements.\nChris Goettl at Ivanti notes that Google Chrome is shipping an update today which will trigger updates for Chromium based browsers including Microsoft Edge, so be on the lookout for Chrome and Edge updates as we proceed through the week.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Tuesday 11th of February 2025 11:58 PM \r\n         \nyou forgot about DC strong cert enforcement:\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16#bkmk_certmap\nif organizations have not taken action, authentication could be broken. even though the KB is old, February 2025 is when MS flips the switch: “domain controllers will move to Full Enforcement mode when the February 2025 Windows security update is installed. Authentication will be denied if a certificate cannot be strongly mapped”\nYou forgot a bug CVE-2025-TRUMP.  That bug affects the entire country,\nMicrosoft makes it hard to cancel and get the Office 365 Personal Classic version, without Copilot. Some users were able to see it, but others were not. I was able to get a free two-month extension online. I asked for a callback. After about a 10 minute wait, someone called back from MS. She said I could cancel my subscription and switch to the Classic version, but I would lose my two month extension. OK, so if I want to keep the extra two months, I need to call back in May, when it is about to renew. Then I can cancel my Family subscription ($99 per month) and get the original $69 plan. This would be “the easiest way”, to which I disagreed.\nI accidentally deleted Microsoft Office (2019) from my computer and it will not reinstall with the product key.  I tried but do not like the Microsoft 365 Co-pilot version.  Any suggestions on how to work around this to get a ‘classic’ version of Office or an alternative that includes Excel?\nYour email address will not be published.

He threatened legal action against any claims to the contrary.\n\n\n\n“Regardless, it’s up to judicial authorities to ascertain the source of the vulnerabilities that have been claimed,” he said, adding that Italian intelligence services “are ready to provide full support.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThe Guardian has reported that Paragon halted its contract with Italy after the spyware attack became public, but Ciriani said the contract with the intelligence services continues. That suggests that a second contract, perhaps with another law enforcement agency or police department, was canceled.

The message they received from WhatsApp suggested they contact Citizen Lab, based out of the Munk School at the University of Toronto, which has for years played a leading role in exposing state-backed hackers.\n\n\n\nCancellato said he believed he had been targeted as the “backdoor” through which hackers could see what investigative stories Fanpage was developing. He surmised Fanpage’s undercover reports, in which journalists infiltrated the youth branch of Premier Giorgia Meloni’s party and exposed neofascist behavior, might have been of interest.\n\n\n\nCasarini, for his part, heads an aid group that rescues migrants in the Mediterranean and has criticized the Italian government’s support of Libya’s patrols of its coasts to prevent smugglers’ boats from leaving.\n\n\n\nHe said he was cooperating with prosecutors.\n\t\t\t\nMeta’s WhatsApp messaging service informed dozens of people across the European Union on Jan. 31 that they had been targeted in a spyware attack using technology from Israeli cyber firm Paragon Solutions.\n\n\n\nIn a statement provided by Meta’s Italy press office, WhatsApp said it had disrupted what it called “a spyware campaign by Paragon that targeted several users, including journalists and members of civil society.”\n\n\n\nAfter The Guardian newspaper broke the story, the Italian government confirmed on Feb. 5 that at least seven Italian cellphones were involved and that it had activated the National Cybersecurity Agency, which reports to the premier’s office, to investigate.\n\n\n\nIt said other targeted phones had numbers from Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to parliament’s lower chamber Wednesday, Cabinet Minister Luca Ciriani confirmed that the Italian government for many years has had a contract with Paragon Solutions to provide intelligence-gathering capabilities to fight terrorism and other threats to national security.\n\n\n\nBut he insisted that the law was “rigorously respected” and denied the government had used the technology to spy on journalists illegally.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nA subgroup of the Russia-linked Seashell Blizzard is tasked with broad initial access operations to sustain long-term persistence.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThe Russia-linked threat actor known as Seashell Blizzard has tasked one of its subgroups with obtaining initial access to internet-facing infrastructure and establishing long-term persistence in targeted organizations, Microsoft reports.\nAlso referred to as APT44, BlackEnergy Lite, Sandworm, Telebots, and Voodoo Bear, Seashell Blizzard has been active since at least 2009, and is believed to be associated with Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) military unit 74455.\n\n\n\nThe threat actor is known for engaging in espionage, information operations, and cyber disruptions, such as the destructive KillDisk (2015) MeDoc (2017), NotPetya (2017), FoxBlade (2022), and Prestige (2022) attacks.\n\n\n\nSeashell Blizzard targeting of critical infrastructure – including ICS and SCADA systems in the energy, water, government, manufacturing, military, telecommunications, and transportation sectors – has been leveraged in military operations, especially in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n“Since at least April 2023, Seashell Blizzard has increased targeting of military communities in the region, likely for tactical intelligence gain. Their persistent targeting of Ukraine suggests Seashell Blizzard is tasked to obtain and retain access to high-priority targets to provide the Russian military and Russian government a range of options for future actions,” Microsoft notes in a Wednesday report.\n\n\n\nFor the past four years, a subgroup within Seashell Blizzard has been engaged in a broad initial access operation referred to as the ‘BadPilot campaign’, with the purpose of establishing persistence within high-value targets, in support of tailored network operations.\n\n\n\n“Active since at least 2021, this subgroup within Seashell Blizzard has leveraged opportunistic access techniques and stealthy forms of persistence to collect credentials, achieve command execution, and support lateral movement that has at times led to substantial regional network compromises,” Microsoft explains.\n\n\n\nThe subgroup’s activities, the tech giant says, allowed Seashell Blizzard to scale operations horizontally by gaining access to global targets across multiple sectors, including international governments.Advertisement.

This persistent access is noted in at least three cases to have preceded select destructive attacks attributed to Seashell Blizzard, highlighting that the subgroup may periodically enable destructive or disruptive attacks,” Microsoft says.\n\n\n\nThe initial access subgroup has been observed using web shells to maintain persistence, but in early 2024 it started deploying remote management and monitoring (RMM) solutions for persistence and for deploying secondary tools that enabled further compromise.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft also observed the subgroup making malicious modifications to network resources such as OWA sign-in pages and DNS configurations, to passively gather network credentials, and injecting malicious JavaScript code into legitimate sign-in portals to collect usernames and passwords.\n\n\n\n“Given that Seashell Blizzard is Russia’s cyber tip of the spear in Ukraine, Microsoft Threat Intelligence assesses that this access subgroup will continue to innovate new horizontally scalable techniques to compromise networks both in Ukraine and globally in support of Russia’s war objectives and evolving national priorities,” the tech giant notes.\n\n\n\nRelated: Russian Hackers Exploited 7-Zip Zero-Day Against Ukraine\nRelated: European Union Sanctions Russian Nationals for Hacking Estonia\nRelated: Russian Cybercrime Network Targeted for Sanctions Across US, UK and Australia\nRelated: Russian APT Chained Firefox and Windows Zero-Days Against US and European Targets\n\nAlso referred to as APT44, BlackEnergy Lite, Sandworm, Telebots, and Voodoo Bear, Seashell Blizzard has been active since at least 2009, and is believed to be associated with Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) military unit 74455.\n\n\n\nThe threat actor is known for engaging in espionage, information operations, and cyber disruptions, such as the destructive KillDisk (2015) MeDoc (2017), NotPetya (2017), FoxBlade (2022), and Prestige (2022) attacks.\n\n\n\nSeashell Blizzard targeting of critical infrastructure – including ICS and SCADA systems in the energy, water, government, manufacturing, military, telecommunications, and transportation sectors – has been leveraged in military operations, especially in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n“Since at least April 2023, Seashell Blizzard has increased targeting of military communities in the region, likely for tactical intelligence gain.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nSecurity and compliance automation firm Drata has acquired trust center platform SafeBase in a quarter billion dollar deal.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nSecurity and compliance automation solutions provider Drata announced on Tuesday that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SafeBase, a company known for its trust center platform. \nSecurityWeek has been told that Drata is acquiring SafeBase in a $250 million deal.\n\n\n\nDrata, which was valued at $2 billion after raising $200 million in Series C funding in 2022, has developed a cloud-based platform designed to help organizations find and fix compliance issues.

The updates also address one high- and four medium-severity bugs.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Ivanti released N-MDM R110 to resolve a medium-severity flaw, and announced that CSA version 5.0.5 patches a critical-risk OS injection and a medium-risk path traversal, tracked as CVE-2024-47908 (CVSS score of 9.1) and CVE-2024-11771 (CVSS score of 5.3).\n\n\n\n“Successful exploitation of CVE-2024-47908 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution and CVE-2024-11771 could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to access restricted functionality,” the company said.\n\n\n\nIvanti says it is not aware of any of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild, but customers are advised to update their appliances as soon as possible.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Fortinet published 14 security advisories describing flaws in FortiOS, FortiPortal, FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, and several other products.\n\n\n\nThe most severe of these issues include CVE-2025-24470 (CVSS score of 8.1), a FortiPortal bug that enables a remote unauthenticated attacker to retrieve source code, and CVE-2024-40591 (CVSS score of 8.0), an incorrect privilege assignment flaw in the FortiOS security fabric that could allow an attacker logged in as admin to escalate their privileges to super-admin.\n\n\n\nFortinet also resolved a high-severity stack-based buffer overflow defect in FortiOS CAPWAP control that could lead to arbitrary code execution, and which is tracked as CVE-2024-35279.\n\n\n\nThe company also updated the January advisory for an exploited zero-day in FortiOS and FortiProxy to add a second CVE to the list, namely CVE-2025-24472 (CVSS score of 8.1).\n\n\n\nThe initial vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-55591, allowed an attacker to elevate their privileges to super-admin by sending crafted requests to the Node.js websocket module. The new CVE covers an additional attack vector that relies on crafted CSF proxy requests.\n\n\n\nFortinet’s remaining advisories detail medium- and low-severity vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution, information leaks, authentication bypass, privilege escalation, retrieval of private keys and encrypted passwords, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, file deletion, and secret decryption.\n\n\n\nThe company makes no mention of any of these issues being exploited in the wild.

Cyberattacks have affected port operations and future incidents could have severe impact, the office says.\n\n\n\n“To help address these risks, the Coast Guard assists MTS owners and operators through offering direct technical assistance, providing voluntary guidelines for implementing cybersecurity practices, and sharing cyber threat information. The service also provides oversight through facility and vessel inspections, including the identification and documentation of cybersecurity-related deficiencies,” GAO notes.\n\n\n\nThe office’s review, however, determined that the Coast Guard’s system of record does not provide ready access to complete information on cybersecurity issues discovered during inspections at facilities and vessels, and that updating it would resolve the gap and help prevent cyberattacks impacting the MTS.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, GAO discovered that the Coast Guard’s cyber strategy does not cover all key characteristics for an efficient national strategy, including problem definition and risk assessment; goals, subordinate objectives, activities, and performance measures; resources and investments; and roles, responsibilities, and coordination.\n\n\n\nAccording to GAO, the Coast Guard has not ensured that its cybersecurity personnel has the competencies required to address risks to MTS, has not fully developed competency requirements, and has not fully assessed and addressed competency gaps.Advertisement.

It describes Server Board BMC vulnerabilities that can lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure and denial of service (DoS).\n\n\n\nIntel Server Board products are affected by a critical unauthenticated privilege escalation issue introduced by the use of AMI BMC firmware. In addition, Server Board products are impacted by two high-severity privilege escalation issues, and two medium-severity bugs that can allow DoS attacks and information disclosure.\n\n\n\nTen of Intel’s new advisories describe high-severity vulnerabilities, including ones affecting Driver Support Assistant (privilege escalation), processor UEFI firmware (privilege escalation and information disclosure), QuickAssist (privilege escalation), chipset firmware (DoS), System Security Report and System Resource Defense (privilege escalation), Battery Life Diagnostic Tool (privilege escalation), PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer WiFi (DoS), Graphics software (privilege escalation), and Memory Latency Checker (DoS).\n\n\n\nIntel patched medium- and low-severity issues in processors, as well as in 800 series Ethernet driver, Graphics Performance Analyzer, Thread Director Visualizer, Quartus Prime, RealSense, Ethernet Port Configuration Tool, FPGA Support Package, Extreme Tuning Utility, High Level Synthesis Compiler, SGX, Advisor, MPI Library for Windows, Data Streaming Accelerator, Chipset Software Installation Utility, Driver & Support Assistant, Ethernet Adapter Complete Driver Pack, Server Platform Services, Video Processing Library, Wireless Bluetooth and Killer Bluetooth, and Ethernet Connection I219 series products.\n\n\n\nThese medium- and low-severity flaws can allow privilege escalation, information disclosure, and DoS attacks. Advertisement.

Some of them describe server, client and embedded processor vulnerabilities, including several high-severity flaws that attackers may be able to exploit for arbitrary code execution. \n\n\n\nThese vulnerabilities are caused by improper input validation in the SMM (System Management Mode) handler, and AMD has also published two separate advisories addressing other high-severity issues related to SMM.\n\n\n\nThe company has also published separate advisories for graphics driver and GPU issues, a majority potentially leading to DoS or data corruption. \n\n\n\nAMD customers were also informed on Tuesday about DLL hijacking vulnerabilities in AMD Integrated Management Technology (AIM-T) and Ryzen Master Utility, which could allow privilege escalation and code execution.\n\n\n\nAnother high-severity flaw that could allow arbitrary code execution was identified in the AMD Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware (DASH) command line interface.\n\n\n\nAMD has also addressed a recent side-channel attack method named ZenLeak, discovered by researchers at Wuhan University. The company noted that existing mitigations for prime and probe attacks are applicable to ZenLeak as well. \n\n\n\nNvidia\nNvidia on Tuesday published four new security advisories. One of them describes a high-severity vulnerability in Container Toolkit and GPU Operator, which could allow arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, DoS attacks, information disclosure, and data tampering. \n\n\n\nAnother high-severity vulnerability with similar potential impact was patched by Nvidia in the Jetson AGX Orin and IGX Orin series products. \n\n\n\nOne medium-severity security hole that can lead to a DoS condition has been fixed in Nvidia’s Triton Inference Server, and four medium-severity bugs that could lead to data tampering and code execution have been patched in the nvJPEG2000 library.\n\n\n\nRelated: Intel Warns of 20+ Vulnerabilities, Advises Firmware Updates\nRelated: Chipmaker Patch Tuesday: Intel, AMD Address Over 110 Vulnerabilities\nRelated: Chipmaker Patch Tuesday: Intel, AMD Address New Microarchitectural Vulnerabilities\n\nIntel\nIntel, which in 2024 patched a total of 374 vulnerabilities, published 34 new advisories on Tuesday. \n\n\n\nOnly one advisory has an overall severity rating of ‘critical’.

        "Date": "2025-02-12",
        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nOn the eve of the Munich Security Conference, Google argues that the cybercriminal threat should be treated as a national security threat like state-backed hacking groups.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nIt is no longer realistic to treat cybercriminals and state-backed cyber adversaries as separate threats – the personnel, tools, and effects are often indistinguishable.\nOn the eve of the 61st international Munich Security Conference, the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) argues that financially motivated cybercriminal activity should be treated as a threat to national security requiring coordinated international cooperation.\n\n\n\nCybercrime is traditionally classified as either financially motivated cyber criminality or state-backed politically biased intrusions. While state-backed cyberattacks often receive more media attention, and perhaps more intelligence scrutiny, financially motivated crime is more common (in 2024, Mandiant responded to almost four times more financial than state-backed attacks).\n\n\n\nBoth sets of attackers are criminals, but there is no clearcut distinction since adversarial nations can and do co-opt criminals for state activity and can and do purchase criminal capabilities to further their political aims. Similarly, Iran and North Korea have used state-backed operatives to conduct financially motivated crimes to finance their regimes.\n\n\n\nSandworm (APT44) is a good example of the intermingling of state actors and criminal tools. While linked to the GRU (a Russian military intelligence unit), APT44 has employed malware available from cybercrime communities to conduct espionage and disruptive operations in Ukraine\n\n\n\nWhile the average victim organization needs make little distinction between attacker motivation within its own defensive posture, GTIG now argues that at a national level the general cybercriminal threat should be treated as a national security threat like state-backed hacking groups. But since cybercrime is international in its make-up, tackling this threat will require international cooperation.\n\n\n\nThe conflation of personnel and tools\nAdversarial states take advantage of the large pool of cybercriminals and their tools. Doing so increases their manpower, lowers their costs, and – crucially – provides plausible deniability of state involvement. This plausible deniability is essential to avoid triggering an all-out cyberwar. \n\n\n\nRussian state leverages malware, tools and manpower from crime marketplaces\nWhen Russia was accused of hacking the DNC in 2016, Putin said it wasn’t the Russian state. Pointing a finger at cybercriminals, he said, “We definitely don’t do such things at a state level.” Twelve Russian intelligence officers were later indicted by a US grand jury.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nAdversarial nations have historically avoided triggering full-scale cyberwar for fear that it might in turn trigger a kinetic conflict. But where a kinetic conflict already exists, the importance of deniability decreases. GTIG believes APT44 was responsible for delivering the Prestige ransomware against logistics entities in Poland and Ukraine in October 2022 in “a rare instance in which APT44 deployed disruptive capabilities against a NATO country.”\n\n\n\nAs global geopolitical tensions increase, so does the importance and validity of distinguishing between state-backed and ‘simple’ criminality decrease.\n\n\n\nThis intermingling of cybercriminal people and tools with state-backed operations is not limited to Russia: both Iran and China have done similar. Nor is it new. As long ago as 1986, the KGB employed an East German hacker named Markus Hess to compromise and steal data from military and industrial computers in the US, Europe, and East Asia – most notably the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\n\n\nThe difference now is the scale of the practice and the damage that can be caused. Criminal ransomware without decryption is little different to a state-backed wiper.\n\n\n\nCybercriminal effects are now like hybrid warfare\nPart of hybrid warfare is to damage the morale and well-being of the people of the target nation. This is obviously part of the remit of state-backed groups – GTIG argues that criminal groups can have a similar effect through ransomware. Attacks against healthcare and utilities can cause widespread problems affecting ordinary people. \n\n\n\nCriminals are aware of this, as confirmed in the Conti Leaks. The actors involved in the planned 2020 attacks against US healthcare knew they would cause public alarm, with one actor writing ‘there will be panic’. The more critical the service, the more attractive the target. Potential public ‘panic’, as demanded by state-backed hybrid warfare, is now inseparable from financially motivated criminal ransomware.\n\n\n\nIn the UK, it was reported that a June 2024 ransomware attack on an NHS contractor led to multiple cases of “long-term or permanent impact on physical, mental or social function or shortening of life-expectancy.”\n\n\n\nIn 2022, again involving Conti, ransomware attacks against Costa Rican government agencies caused sufficient disruption to the nation for the president to declare a national emergency.\n\n\n\nThe distinction between state-backed operators and simple criminals cannot be measured by the effect of the attack. Nor indeed can it be measured by the motivation for the attack – and North Korea is a prime example. NK’s cyberattacks perform the usual state purpose of cyber espionage and technology IP theft, but also engage in widespread financially motivated cryptocurrency theft to support the national government.\n\n\n\nPut simply, cybercrime (a criminal threat) should not be treated in isolation from state-backed cyber activity (a national security political threat) because the manpower, tooling, motivations, and effects are impossible to separate. Cybercrime is now a national security issue.\n\n\n\nGTIG recommendations to the international community\n“We believe tackling this challenge will require a new and stronger approach that recognizes the cybercriminal threat as a national security priority requiring international cooperation,” says GTIG. “More must – and can – be done.”\n\n\n\nGovernment takedowns of ransomware groups are useful but provide only temporary relief for the attacked and a temporary inconvenience for the attacker. The cybercrime ecosystem is resilient, international and quickly recovers from individual takedowns. While these should continue, GTIG recommends that policymakers take additional steps.\n\n\n\nThese steps should include elevating cybercrime as a national security priority; that is, prioritizing intelligence collection and analysis on cybercriminal organizations, and enhancing law enforcement capacity to investigate and prosecute cybercrime.\n\n\n\nStrengthening cybersecurity defenses by incentivizing best practices and investing in research and development of new security technologies that can improve resilience.\n\n\n\nDisrupting the cybercrime ecosystem by targeting the key enablers such as malware developers, bulletproof hosting providers, and financial intermediaries (including cryptocurrency exchanges). In short, “to dismantle the infrastructure that supports cybercriminal operations.”\n\n\n\nEnhancing international cooperation by prioritizing “the development of international frameworks for information sharing, joint investigations, and coordinated takedowns of cybercriminal networks.”\n\n\n\nEmpowering individuals and businesses through cybersecurity awareness and education, and enabling service providers to act against cybercriminals through legislation. This should also include resources for reporting and recovering from cyberattacks.\n\n\n\nElevating strong private sector security practices by encouraging the adoption of proven technologies and discouraging overreliance on a single technology.\n\n\n\nThe one explicit recommendation GTIG does not suggest is government backdoors into end-to-end encrypted messaging. This would undoubtedly help governments in fighting cybercrime through increased access to intelligence; but it is a political and social hot potato. It may be implied in GTIG’s existing recommendations – or it may simply be that CTIG believes that weakening encrypted messaging will help the criminals as much as it will help the authorities.\n\n\n\nRelated: White House Issues National Security Memorandum for Critical Infrastructure\nRelated: Beyond the Hype: Questioning FUD in Cybersecurity Marketing\nRelated: Kapeka: A New Backdoor in Sandworm’s Arsenal of Aggression\nRelated: US, Japan, South Korea Blame North Korean Hackers for $660M Crypto Heists\nRelated: Economic Warfare: Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Part of Geopolitical Conflict\n\nOn the eve of the 61st international Munich Security Conference, the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) argues that financially motivated cybercriminal activity should be treated as a threat to national security requiring coordinated international cooperation.\n\n\n\nCybercrime is traditionally classified as either financially motivated cyber criminality or state-backed politically biased intrusions.

Cybercrime is now a national security issue.\n\n\n\nGTIG recommendations to the international community\n“We believe tackling this challenge will require a new and stronger approach that recognizes the cybercriminal threat as a national security priority requiring international cooperation,” says GTIG. “More must – and can – be done.”\n\n\n\nGovernment takedowns of ransomware groups are useful but provide only temporary relief for the attacked and a temporary inconvenience for the attacker. The cybercrime ecosystem is resilient, international and quickly recovers from individual takedowns.

This is obviously part of the remit of state-backed groups – GTIG argues that criminal groups can have a similar effect through ransomware. Attacks against healthcare and utilities can cause widespread problems affecting ordinary people. \n\n\n\nCriminals are aware of this, as confirmed in the Conti Leaks. The actors involved in the planned 2020 attacks against US healthcare knew they would cause public alarm, with one actor writing ‘there will be panic’. The more critical the service, the more attractive the target. Potential public ‘panic’, as demanded by state-backed hybrid warfare, is now inseparable from financially motivated criminal ransomware.\n\n\n\nIn the UK, it was reported that a June 2024 ransomware attack on an NHS contractor led to multiple cases of “long-term or permanent impact on physical, mental or social function or shortening of life-expectancy.”\n\n\n\nIn 2022, again involving Conti, ransomware attacks against Costa Rican government agencies caused sufficient disruption to the nation for the president to declare a national emergency.\n\n\n\nThe distinction between state-backed operators and simple criminals cannot be measured by the effect of the attack. Nor indeed can it be measured by the motivation for the attack – and North Korea is a prime example. NK’s cyberattacks perform the usual state purpose of cyber espionage and technology IP theft, but also engage in widespread financially motivated cryptocurrency theft to support the national government.\n\n\n\nPut simply, cybercrime (a criminal threat) should not be treated in isolation from state-backed cyber activity (a national security political threat) because the manpower, tooling, motivations, and effects are impossible to separate. Cybercrime is now a national security issue.\n\n\n\nGTIG recommendations to the international community\n“We believe tackling this challenge will require a new and stronger approach that recognizes the cybercriminal threat as a national security priority requiring international cooperation,” says GTIG. “More must – and can – be done.”\n\n\n\nGovernment takedowns of ransomware groups are useful but provide only temporary relief for the attacked and a temporary inconvenience for the attacker.
