        "Content": "Lovable\n, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered platform that allows for creating full-stack web applications using text-based prompts, has been found to be the most susceptible to jailbreak attacks, allowing novice and aspiring cybercrooks to set up lookalike credential harvesting pages.\n\"As a purpose-built tool for creating and deploying web apps, its capabilities line up perfectly with every scammer's wishlist,\" Guardio Labs' Nati Tal\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News. \"From pixel-perfect scam pages to live hosting, evasion techniques, and even admin dashboards to track stolen data -- Lovable didn't just participate, it performed. No guardrails, no hesitation.\"\nThe technique has been codenamed\nVibeScamming\n– a play on the term vibe coding, which refers to an AI-dependent programming technique to produce software by describing the problem statement in a few sentences as a prompt to a large language model (LLM) tuned for coding.\nThe abuse of LLMs and AI chatbots for malicious purposes is not a new phenomenon. In recent weeks, research has shown how threat actors are abusing popular tools like\nOpenAI ChatGPT\nand\nGoogle Gemini\nto assist with malware development, research, and content creation.\nWhat's more, LLMs like DeepSeek have also been found susceptible to\nprompt attacks\nand\njailbreaking techniques\nlike\nBad Likert Judge\n,\nCrescendo\n, and\nDeceptive Delight\nthat allow the models to bypass safety and ethical guardrails and generate other prohibited content. This includes\ncreating\nphishing emails, keylogger and ransomware samples, albeit with additional prompting and debugging.\nIn a report published last month, Broadcom-owned Symantec\nrevealed\nhow OpenAI's\nOperator\n, an AI agent that can carry out web-based actions on behalf of the user, could be weaponized to automate the whole process of finding email addresses of specific people, creating PowerShell scripts that can gather system information, stashing them in Google Drive, and drafting and sending phishing emails to those individuals and trick them into executing the script.\nThe rising popularity of AI tools also means that they could significantly reduce the barriers to entry for attackers, enabling them to harness their coding capabilities to craft functional malware with little-to-no technical expertise of their own\nA case in example is a new jailbreaking approach dubbed\nImmersive World\nthat makes it possible to create an information stealer capable of harvesting credentials and other sensitive data stored in a Google Chrome browser. The technique \"uses\nnarrative engineering\nto bypass LLM security controls\" by creating a detailed fictional world and assigning roles with specific rules so as to get around the restricted operations.\nGuardio Labs' latest analysis takes a step further, uncovering that platforms like Lovable and Anthropic Claude, to a lesser extent, could be weaponized to generate complete scam campaigns, complete with SMS text message templates, Twilio-based SMS delivery of the fake links, content obfuscation, defense evasion, and\nTelegram integration\n.\nVibeScamming begins with a direct prompt asking the AI tool to automate each step of the attack cycle, assessing its initial response, and then adopting a multi-prompt approach to gently steer the LLM model to generate the intended malicious response. Called \"level up,\" this phase involves enhancing the phishing page, refining delivery methods, and increasing the legitimacy of the scam.\nLovable, per Guardio, has been found to not only produce a convincing looking login page mimicking the real Microsoft sign-in page, but also auto-deploys the page on a URL hosted on its own subdomain (\"i.e., *.lovable.app\") and redirects to office[.]com after credential theft.\nOn top of that, both Claude and Lovable appear to comply with prompts seeking help to avoid the scam pages from being flagged by security solutions, as well as exfiltrate the stolen credentials to external services like Firebase, RequestBin, and JSONBin, or private Telegram channel.\n\"What's more alarming is not just the graphical similarity but also the user experience,\" Tal said. \"It mimics the real thing so well that it's arguably smoother than the actual Microsoft login flow. This demonstrates the raw power of task-focused AI agents and how, without strict hardening, they can unknowingly become tools for abuse.\"\n\"Not only did it generate the scampage with full credential storage, but it also gifted us a fully functional admin dashboard to review all captured data – credentials, IP addresses, timestamps, and full plaintext passwords.\"\nIn conjunction with the findings, Guardio has also released the first version of what's called the VibeScamming Benchmark to put the generative AI models through the wringer and test their resilience against potential abuse in phishing workflows. While ChaGPT scored an 8 out of 10, Claude scored 4.3, and Lovable scored 1.8, indicating high exploitability.\n\"ChatGPT, while arguably the most advanced general-purpose model, also turned out to be the most cautious one,\" Tal said. \"Claude, by contrast, started with solid pushback but proved easily persuadable. Once prompted with 'ethical' or 'security research' framing, it offered surprisingly robust guidance.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A Chinese-affiliated threat actor known for its cyber-attacks in Asia has been observed exploiting a security flaw in security software from ESET to deliver a previously undocumented malware codenamed\nTCESB\n.\n\"Previously unseen in ToddyCat attacks, [TCESB] is designed to stealthily execute payloads in circumvention of protection and monitoring tools installed on the device,\" Kaspersky\nsaid\nin an analysis published this week.\nToddyCat\nis the name given to a threat activity cluster that has targeted several entities in Asia, with attacks dating all the way back to at least December 2020.\nLast year, the Russian cybersecurity vendor\ndetailed\nthe hacking group's use of various tools to maintain persistent access to compromised environments and harvest data on an \"industrial scale\" from organizations located in the Asia-Pacific region.\nKaspersky said its investigation into ToddyCat-related incidents in early 2024 unearthed a suspicious DLL file (\"version.dll\") in the temp directory on multiple devices. The 64-bit DLL, TCESB, has been found to be launched via a technique called\nDLL Search Order Hijacking\nto seize control of the execution flow.\nThis, in turn, is said to have been accomplished by taking advantage of a flaw in the\nESET Command Line Scanner\n, which insecurely loads a DLL named \"version.dll\" by first checking for the file in the current directory and then checking for it in the system directories.\nIt's worth pointing out at this stage that \"\nversion.dll\n\" is a legitimate\nversion-checking and file installation library\nfrom Microsoft that resides in the \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\\" or \"C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\\" directories.\nA consequence of exploiting this loophole is that attackers could execute their malicious version of \"version.dll\" as opposed to its legitimate counterpart. The vulnerability, tracked as\nCVE-2024-11859\n(CVSS score: 6.8), was\nfixed\nby ESET in late January 2025 following responsible disclosure.\n\"The vulnerability potentially allowed an attacker with administrator privileges to load a malicious dynamic-link library and execute its code,\" ESET\nsaid\nin an advisory released last week. \"This technique did not elevate the privileges, though – the attacker would have already needed to have administrator privileges to perform this attack.\"\nIn a statement shared with The Hacker News, the Slovak cybersecurity company said it released fixed builds of its consumer, business, and server security products for the Windows operating system to address the vulnerability.\nTCESB, for its part, is a modified version of an open-source tool called EDRSandBlast that includes features to alter operating system kernel structures to disable notification routines (aka\ncallbacks\n), which are designed to allow drivers to be notified of specific events, such as process creation or setting a registry key.\nTo pull this off, TCESB leverages another known technique referred to as bring your own vulnerable driver (\nBYOVD\n) to install a vulnerable driver, a Dell DBUtilDrv2.sys driver, in the system through the Device Manager interface. The DBUtilDrv2.sys driver is susceptible to a known privilege escalation flaw tracked as\nCVE-2021-36276\n.\nThis is not the first time Dell drivers have been abused for malicious purposes. In 2022, a similar privilege escalation vulnerability (\nCVE-2021-21551\n) in another Dell driver, dbutil_2_3.sys, was also\nexploited\nas part of BYOVD attacks by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group to turn off security mechanisms.\n\"Once the vulnerable driver is installed in the system, TCESB runs a loop in which it checks every two seconds for the presence of a payload file with a specific name in the current directory – the payload may not be present at the time of launching the tool,\" Kaspersky researcher Andrey Gunkin said.\nWhile the payload artifacts themselves are unavailable, further analysis has determined that they are encrypted using AES-128 and that they are decoded and executed as soon as they appear in the specified path.\n\"To detect the activity of such tools, it's recommended to monitor systems for installation events involving drivers with known vulnerabilities,\" Kaspersky said. \"It's also worth monitoring events associated with loading Windows kernel debug symbols on devices where debugging of the operating system kernel is not expected.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "GitGuardian's State of Secrets Sprawl report for 2025\nreveals the alarming scale of secrets exposure in modern software environments. Driving this is the rapid growth of non-human identities (NHIs), which have been outnumbering human users for years. We need to get ahead of it and prepare security measures and governance for these machine identities as they continue to be deployed, creating an unprecedented level of security risk.\nThis report reveals an astounding 23.77 million new secrets were leaked on GitHub in 2024 alone. This is a 25% surge from the previous year. This dramatic increase highlights how the proliferation of non-human identities (NHIs), such as service accounts, microservices, and AI agents, are rapidly expanding the attack surface for threat actors.\nThe Non-Human Identity Crisis\nNHI secrets, including API keys, service accounts, and Kubernetes workers, now outnumber human identities by at least 45-to-1 in DevOps environments. These machine-based credentials are essential for modern infrastructure but create significant security challenges when mismanaged.\nMost concerning is the persistence of exposed credentials. GitGuardian's analysis found that 70% of secrets first detected in public repositories back in 2022 remain active today, indicating a systemic failure in credential rotation and management practices.\nPrivate Repositories: A False Sense of Security\nOrganizations may believe their code is secure in private repositories, but the data tells a different story. Private repositories are approximately 8 times more likely to contain secrets than public ones. This suggests that many teams rely on \"security through obscurity\" rather than implementing proper secrets management.\nThe report found significant differences in the types of secrets leaked in private versus public repositories:\nGeneric secrets represent 74.4% of all leaks in private repositories versus 58% in public ones\nGeneric passwords account for 24% of all generic secrets in private repositories compared to only 9% in public repositories\nEnterprise credentials like AWS IAM keys appear in 8% of private repositories but only 1.5% of public ones\nThis pattern suggests that developers are more cautious with public code but often cut corners in environments they believe are protected.\nAI Tools Worsening the Problem\nGitHub Copilot and other AI coding assistants might boost productivity, but\nthey're also increasing security risks\n. Repositories with Copilot enabled were found to have a 40% higher incidence rate of secret leaks compared to repositories without AI assistance.\nThis troubling statistic suggests that AI-powered development, while accelerating code production, may be encouraging developers to prioritize speed over security, embedding credentials in ways that traditional development practices might avoid.\nDocker Hub: 100,000+ Valid Secrets Exposed\nIn an unprecedented analysis of 15 million public Docker images from Docker Hub, GitGuardian discovered more than 100,000 valid secrets, including AWS keys, GCP keys, and GitHub tokens belonging to Fortune 500 companies.\nThe research found that 97% of these valid secrets were discovered exclusively in image layers, with most appearing in layers smaller than 15MB. ENV instructions alone accounted for 65% of all leaks, highlighting a significant blind spot in container security.\nBeyond Source Code: Secrets in Collaboration Tools\nSecret leaks aren't limited to code repositories. The report found that collaboration platforms like Slack, Jira, and Confluence have become significant vectors for credential exposure.\nAlarmingly, secrets found in these platforms tend to be more critical than those in source code repositories, with 38% of incidents classified as highly critical or urgent compared to 31% in source code management systems. This happens partly because these platforms lack the security controls present in modern source code management tools.\nAlarmingly, only 7% of secrets found in collaboration tools are also found in the code base, making this area of secrets sprawl a unique challenge that most secret scanning tools can not mitigate. It is also exasperated by the fact that the users of these systems cross all department boundaries, meaning everyone is potentially leaking credentials into these platforms.\nThe Permissions Problem\nFurther exacerbating the risk, GitGuardian found that leaked credentials frequently have excessive permissions:\n99% of GitLab API keys had either full access (58%) or read-only access (41%)\n96% of GitHub tokens had write access, with 95% offering full repository access\nThese broad permissions significantly amplify the potential impact of leaked credentials, enabling attackers to move laterally and escalate privileges more easily.\nBreaking the Cycle of Secrets Sprawl\nWhile organizations increasingly adopt secret management solutions, the report emphasizes these tools alone aren't enough. GitGuardian found that even repositories using secrets managers had a 5.1% incidence rate of leaked secrets in 2024.\nThe problem requires\na comprehensive approach that addresses the entire secrets lifecycle\n, combining automated detection with swift remediation processes and integrating security throughout the development workflow.\nAs our report concludes, \"\nThe 2025 State of Secrets Sprawl Report\noffers a stark warning: as non-human identities multiply, so do their associated secrets—and security risks. Reactive and fragmented approaches to secrets management simply aren't enough in a world of automated deployments, AI-generated code, and rapid application delivery.\"\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

It was\nfixed by Redmond\nas part of its Patch Tuesday update for April 2025.\nMicrosoft is tracking the activity and the post-compromise exploitation of CVE-2025-29824 under the moniker Storm-2460, with the threat actors also leveraging a malware named PipeMagic to deliver the exploit as well as ransomware payloads.\nThe exact initial access vector used in the attacks is currently not known. However, the threat actors have been observed using the certutil utility to download malware from a legitimate third-party site that was previously compromised to stage the payloads.\nThe malware is a malicious\nMSBuild file\nthat contains an encrypted payload, which is then unpacked to launch PipeMagic, a plugin-based trojan that has been detected in the wild since 2022.\nIt's worth mentioning here that CVE-2025-29824 is the second Windows zero-day flaw to be delivered via PipeMagic after\nCVE-2025-24983\n, a Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem privilege escalation bug, which was flagged by ESET and patched by Microsoft last month.\nPreviously, PipeMagic was also observed in connection with Nokoyawa ransomware attacks that exploited another CLFS zero-day flaw (\nCVE-2023-28252\n).\n\"In some of the other attacks that we attribute to the same actor, we also observed that, prior to exploiting the CLFS elevation-of-privilege vulnerability, the victim's machines were infected with a custom modular backdoor named 'PipeMagic' that gets launched via an MSBuild script,\" Kaspersky\npointed out\nin April 2023.\nIt's crucial to note that Windows 11, version 24H2, is not affected by this specific exploitation, as access to certain System Information Classes within\nNtQuerySystemInformation\nis restricted to users with\nSeDebugPrivilege\n, which typically only\nadmin-like users\ncan obtain.\n\"The exploit targets a vulnerability in the CLFS kernel driver,\" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team explained. \"The exploit then utilizes a memory corruption and the RtlSetAllBits API to overwrite the exploit process's token with the value 0xFFFFFFFF, enabling all privileges for the process, which allows for process injection into SYSTEM processes.\"\nSuccessful exploitation is followed by the threat actor extracting user credentials by dumping the memory of LSASS and encrypting files on the system with a random extension.\nMicrosoft said it was unable to obtain a ransomware sample for analysis, but said that the ransom note dropped after encryption included a TOR domain tied to the\nRansomEXX\nransomware family\n.\n\"Ransomware threat actors value post-compromise elevation of privilege exploits because these could enable them to escalate initial access, including handoffs from commodity malware distributors, into privileged access,\" Microsoft said. \"They then use privileged access for widespread deployment and detonation of ransomware within an environment.\"\nFound this article interesting?

However, elevation of privilege flaws in CLFS have become especially popular among ransomware operators over the years.\"\nMike Walters, president and co-founder of Action1,\nsaid\nthe vulnerability permits privilege escalation to the SYSTEM level, thereby giving an attacker the ability to install malicious software, modify system settings, tamper with security features, access sensitive data, and maintain persistent access.\n\"What makes this vulnerability particularly concerning is that Microsoft has confirmed active exploitation in the wild, yet at this time, no patch has been released for Windows 10 32-bit or 64-bit systems,\" Ben McCarthy, lead cyber security engineer at Immersive, said. \"The lack of a patch leaves a critical gap in defense for a wide portion of the Windows ecosystem.\"\n\"Under certain memory manipulation conditions, a use-after-free can be triggered, which an attacker can exploit to execute code at the highest privilege level in Windows. Importantly, the attacker does not need administrative privileges to exploit the vulnerability – only local access is required.\"\nThe active exploitation of the flaw, per Microsoft, has been linked to ransomware attacks against a small number of targets.

        "Content": "A targeted campaign exploited Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in websites hosted on AWS EC2 instances to extract EC2 Metadata, which could include Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials from the IMDSv1 endpoint.\nRetrieving IAM credentials allows attackers to escalate their privileges and access S3 buckets or control other AWS services, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure, manipulation, and service disruption.\nThe campaign was discovered by\nF5 Labs researchers\n, who reports that the malicious activity culminated between March 13 and 25, 2025. The traffic and behavioral patterns strongly suggest that it was carried out by a single threat actor.\nCampaign overview\nSSRF problems are web flaws that enable attackers to \"trick\" a server into making HTTP requests to internal resources on their behalf, which usually are not accessible by the attacker.\nIn the campaign observed by F5, the attackers located websites hosted\non EC2\nwith SSRF flaws, allowing them to remotely query the internal EC2 Metadata URLs and receive sensitive data.\nEC2 Metadata is a service in Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) that provides information about a virtual machine running on AWS. This information can include configuration details, network settings, and potentially, security credentials.\nThis metadata service is only accessible by the virtual machine by connecting to special URLs on internal IP addresses, like\nhttp://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/\n.\nThe first malicious SSRF probe was logged on March 13, but the campaign escalated to full scale between March 15 and 25, employing several FBW Networks SAS IPs based in France and Romania.\nDuring this time, the attackers rotated six query parameter names (dest, file, redirect, target, URI, URL) and four subpaths (e.g., /meta-data/, /user-data), showing a systematic approach in exfiltrating sensitive data from vulnerable sites.\nThe attacks worked because the vulnerable instances were running on IMDSv1, AWS's older metadata service that allows anyone with access to the instance to retrieve the metadata, including any stored IAM credentials.\nThe system has been superseded by IMDSv2, which requires session tokens (authentication) to protect websites from SSRF attacks.\nBroader exploitation activity\nThese attacks were highlighted in a March 2025 threat trends report where F5 Labs documented the most exploited vulnerabilities for the past month.\nThe top four most exploited CVEs by volume were:\nCVE-2017-9841\n– PHPUnit remote code execution via eval-stdin.php (69,433 attempts)\nCVE-2020-8958\n– Guangzhou ONU OS command injection RCE (4,773 attempts)\nCVE-2023-1389\n– TP-Link Archer AX21 command injection RCE (4,698 attempts)\nCVE-2019-9082\n– ThinkPHP PHP injection RCE (3,534 attempts)\nExploitation volumes\nSource: F5 Labs\nThe report underlines that older vulnerabilities remain highly targeted, with 40% of exploited CVEs being over four years old.\nTo mitigate the threats, it is recommended to apply the available security updates, harden router and IoT device configurations, and replace EoL networking equipment with supported models.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nNewest Ivanti SSRF zero-day now under mass exploitation\nNew SuperBlack ransomware exploits Fortinet auth bypass flaws\nCentreStack RCE exploited as zero-day to breach file sharing servers\nWho's calling?

The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data.\"\nCybersecurity firm\nCybelAngel\nfirst revealed last week that Oracle told customers that an attacker deployed a web shell and additional malware on some of Oracle's Gen 1 (also known as Oracle Cloud Classic) servers as early as January 2025. Until the breach was detected in late February, the threat actor allegedly stole data from the Oracle Identity Manager (IDM) database, including user emails, hashed passwords, and usernames.\nLast month, BleepingComputer first reported that Oracle privately notified customers of\nanother January breach at Oracle Health\n(a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company previously known as Cerner), which impacted patient data at multiple healthcare organizations and hospitals in the United States.\nSources told BleepingComputer that a threat actor named \"Andrew\"—who has yet to claim affiliation with an extortion or ransomware operation—is now extorting the breached hospitals, demanding millions of dollars in cryptocurrency not to sell or leak the stolen data.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nOracle privately confirms Cloud breach to customers\nOracle customers confirm data stolen in alleged cloud breach is valid\nOracle denies breach after hacker claims theft of 6 million data records\nTexas State Bar warns of data breach after INC ransomware claims attack\nAustralian pension funds hit by wave of credential stuffing attacks"

        "Content": "Imagine receiving a call from a high-ranking official, urgently requesting a wire transfer to resolve a national crisis. This was the case for several wealthy entrepreneurs\nin Italy recently\n, leaving them in an awkward position.\nHowever, it was in fact fraudsters impersonating the Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, trying to trick individuals into transferring large sums of money.\nThis is an example of vishing—a growing cybersecurity threat that’s at risk of going nuclear thanks to AI.\nVishing, or \"voice phishing,\" is a form of social engineering where scammers use phone calls to deceive victims into revealing sensitive information or making fraudulent payments.\nWhile traditional vishing relied on human impersonation, AI now enables attackers to generate highly convincing synthetic voices, even cloning the voices of real individuals.\nHow can your voice be cloned?\nAI can create realistic human voices using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis and deep learning techniques. Advanced models like\nGoogle DeepMind's WaveNet\nand AI-powered vocoders are able to replicate human speech patterns with remarkable accuracy.\nMicrosoft claims that a voice\ncan be cloned in just three seconds\n, meaning a scammer could phone someone for a very brief conversation and then create a realistic AI voice using only that recording.\nVishers will usually impersonate banks, government agencies, or corporate executives to exploit victims' trust. They use urgency, authority, and emotional manipulation to pressure targets into compliance.\nAI-enhanced vishing is more believable and harder to detect, due to how realistic a cloned voice can sound.\nWhen used in combination with other social engineering techniques like phishing (email) and smishing (SMS), these attacks can be hard to spot even for cyber-savvy professionals.\nSecure your Active Directory passwords with Specops Password Policy\nVerizon’s Data Breach Investigation Report found stolen credentials are involved in 44.7% of breaches.\nEffortlessly secure Active Directory with compliant password policies, blocking 4+ billion compromised passwords, boosting security, and slashing support hassles!\nTry it for free\nThe anatomy of an AI vishing attack\nA typical AI vishing attack tends to follow the below process:\nReconnaissance: The attacker gathers personal information about the target.\nSpoofed call: Using AI-generated voices and fake caller IDs, the attacker impersonates a trusted entity.\nUrgency and manipulation: The scammer creates a sense of emergency, claiming a security breach, overdue payment, or crisis.\nInformation extraction: The victim is pressured into revealing credentials, transferring money, or installing malicious software.\nFollow-up attacks: The attacker may reinforce their deception through phishing emails or smishing messages.\nSome cybercriminals also offer \"Vishing-as-a-Service\" (VaaS), where they sell their talents to less-skilled fraudsters. These services include AI voice cloning and robocall automation, making sophisticated scams accessible to a wider range of attackers.\nAs the barriers to entry get lower, it’s likely we’ll see an increasing number of vishing attacks over the coming years.\nWhat if you think you’re being targeted by vishing?\nAI vishing is a serious and evolving cyber threat. With AI making it easier to impersonate trusted voices, businesses and individuals need to stay vigilant.\nBy implementing authentication measures, educating employees, and adopting security best practices, organizations can reduce their exposure to vishing attacks.\nThe key to defense is awareness—don’t trust a voice at face value, especially when money or sensitive information is on the line.\nSigns of a vishing attack\nUnexpected robocalls followed by a personal call.\nUrgent demands for payments or sensitive data.\nPoor audio quality or unnatural voice patterns.\nCalls from unfamiliar numbers or at odd times.\nRequests to bypass standard security procedures.\nBest practices for individuals\nNever share sensitive information over the phone unless you can verify the caller.\nLet unknown numbers go to voicemail and review the message before responding.\nVerify unusual requests using a secondary communication channel, or use\nmulti-factor authentication (MFA)\nto verify callers making sensitive requests.\nRegister phone numbers with the \"Do Not Call\" registry and enable call filtering features.\nEnterprise security measures\nImplement strong authentication protocols at\nservice desks to verify callers\n.\nRequire multi-step verification for sensitive transactions.\nTrain employees to recognize vishing red flags.\nUse AI-based call monitoring to detect fraudulent activity.\nLimit publicly available employee information to reduce targeting risks.\nThe MGM Resorts hack\nThe\nMGM Resorts hack\nwas a prime example of how vishing can be used to bypass security and gain unauthorized access to critical systems. The attackers, believed to be part of the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group, started by researching MGM employees on LinkedIn.\nThey then impersonated an employee and called the MGM service desk, posing as the staff member and requesting access to their account.\nBecause the attackers were convincing and exploited gaps in MGM’s authentication process, they were able to bypass security checks and gain entry into the system.\nThis initial access led to a massive data breach, costing MGM Resorts millions in revenue and causing widespread system disruptions, including issues with reservations, electronic payments, and slot machines in casinos.\nProtect your service desk from vishing\nService desk agents are prime targets for vishing attacks since they often handle sensitive information and user authentication requests. Without proper verification protocols, attackers can impersonate employees, executives, or vendors to gain unauthorized access to systems and data.\nTo defend against vishing threats, organizations must implement strong authentication processes at the service desk.\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA)\nand caller verification techniques can help\nprevent unauthorized access\nand reduce the risk of social engineering attacks.\nEnsuring that agents are trained to recognize vishing attempts and verify caller identities before processing requests is crucial in the face of AI-powered vishing threats.\nWith\nSpecops Secure Service Desk\n, you can enforce strong user verification before allowing password resets or account unlocks. This reduces the risk of impersonation and protects your organization from costly breaches.\nWant to strengthen your security against vishing attacks?\nTry Specops Secure Service Desk today\n.\nSponsored and written by\nSpecops Software\n."

        "Content": "Microsoft today released updates to plug at least 121 security holes in its Windows operating systems and software, including one vulnerability that is already being exploited in the wild. Eleven of those flaws earned Microsoft’s most-dire “critical” rating, meaning malware or malcontents could exploit them with little to no interaction from Windows users.\n\nThe zero-day flaw already seeing exploitation is CVE-2025-29824, a local elevation of privilege bug in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver.  Microsoft rates it as “important,” but as Chris Goettl from Ivanti points out, risk-based prioritization warrants treating it as critical.\nThis CLFS component of Windows is no stranger to Patch Tuesday: According to Tenable’s Satnam Narang, since 2022 Microsoft has patched 32 CLFS vulnerabilities — averaging 10 per year — with six of them exploited in the wild. The last CLFS zero-day was patched in December 2024.\nNarang notes that while flaws allowing attackers to install arbitrary code are consistently top overall Patch Tuesday features, the data is reversed for zero-day exploitation.\n“For the past two years, elevation of privilege flaws have led the pack and, so far in 2025, account for over half of all zero-days exploited,” Narang wrote.\nRapid7’s Adam Barnett warns that any Windows defenders responsible for an LDAP server — which means almost any organization with a non-trivial Microsoft footprint — should add patching for the critical flaw CVE-2025-26663 to their to-do list.\n“With no privileges required, no need for user interaction, and code execution presumably in the context of the LDAP server itself, successful exploitation would be an attractive shortcut to any attacker,” Barnett said. “Anyone wondering if today is a re-run of December 2024 Patch Tuesday can take some small solace in the fact that the worst of the trio of LDAP critical RCEs published at the end of last year was likely easier to exploit than today’s example, since today’s CVE-2025-26663 requires that an attacker win a race condition. Despite that, Microsoft still expects that exploitation is more likely.”\nAmong the critical updates Microsoft patched this month are remote code execution flaws in Windows Remote Desktop services (RDP), including CVE-2025-26671, CVE-2025-27480 and CVE-2025-27482; only the latter two are rated “critical,” and Microsoft marked both of them as “Exploitation More Likely.”\nPerhaps the most widespread vulnerabilities fixed this month were in web browsers. Google Chrome updated to fix 13 flaws this week, and Mozilla Firefox fixed eight bugs, with possibly more updates coming later this week for Microsoft Edge.\nAs it tends to do on Patch Tuesdays, Adobe has released 12 updates resolving 54 security holes across a range of products, including ColdFusion, Adobe Commerce, Experience Manager Forms, After Effects, Media Encoder, Bridge, Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Animate, AEM Screens, and FrameMaker.\nApple users may need to patch as well. On March 31, Apple released a huge security update (more than three gigabytes in size) to fix issues in a range of their products, including at least one zero-day flaw.\nAnd in case you missed it, on March 31, 2025 Apple released a rather large batch of security updates for a wide range of their products, from macOS to the iOS operating systems on iPhones and iPads.\nEarlier today, Microsoft included a note saying Windows 10 security updates weren’t available but would be released as soon as possible. It appears from browsing askwoody.com that this snafu has since been rectified. Either way, if you run into complications applying any of these updates please leave a note about it in the comments below, because the chances are good that someone else had the same problem.\nAs ever, please consider backing up your data and or devices prior to updating, which makes it far less complicated to undo a software update gone awry. For more granular details on today’s Patch Tuesday, check out the SANS Internet Storm Center’s roundup. Microsoft’s update guide for April 2025 is here.\nFor more details on Patch Tuesday, check out the write-ups from Action1 and Automox.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Tuesday 8th of April 2025 11:09 PM \r\n         \nWatch out for these updates. They have fried access to my TPM, lost pins, etc. Uninstall is a bear. If you do decide to install them do an image backup first.\nThanks for reporting on this Brian.  Funny that some of the vulnerabilities require a ‘race condition’ because just last night I was noting how exasperatingly frozen Windows 11 becomes with file activities involving a web browser and Windows Explorer – constant race conditions.\nYour email address will not be published.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nGoogle plans to unleash automated AI agents into overtaxed SOCs to reduce the manual workload for cybersecurity investigators.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nTechnology giant Google this week announced plans to unleash automated AI agents into overtaxed SOCs to reduce the manual workload for cybersecurity investigators.\nThe AI-driven agents, which promises workload relief for Tier 1 and Tier 2 SOC analysts, are a key component of a larger Google Unified Security platform offering security tools across threat intelligence, security operations, cloud security, and secure enterprise browsing.\n\n\n\nAt Google Cloud Next conference, the company said the AI-driven security agents are aimed at easing the pressures on security operations centers that are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of alerts and incident data. By automating routine tasks, Google believes that AI agents will allow human analysts to focus on more complex investigations and speed up incident response tasks.\n\n\n\nThe company said the first tool is an alert triage agent embedded in Google Security Operations that’s slated for preview with select customers in Q2 2025.  The agent will automatically analyze incoming security alerts, gather contextual data, review historical patterns, and produce an automatic verdict on each alert.\n\n\n\nGoogle said the AI agent will provide a full history of its analysis, helping teams understand its decision-making process.\n\n\n\nThe second tool, part of the Google Threat Intelligence suite, is a malware analysis agent that is programmed to auto-evaluate suspicious code. Google said this agent is designed to execute deobfuscation scripts and summarize its findings to determine whether identified code is safe. This agent, too, is on track for a Q2 2025 preview.\n\n\n\nThe plans for agentic AI security tooling follows Google’s rollout of an experimental artificial intelligence model designed to support incident response and threat analysis workflows coming from its Mandiant threat-intel unit.\n\n\n\nThe AI model, called Sec-Gemini v1, touts a combination of Google’s Gemini large language model capabilities with near real-time security data and tooling, including integration with Google Threat Intelligence (GTI), the Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) database, and other internal resources.  Advertisement.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nThe greatest security policies in the world are useless if enterprises don’t have a reasonable, consistent, and reliable way to implement them.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nI’ve always been a fan of Groucho Marx. I find his humor, along with his quotes, witty and entertaining. One of my favorite Groucho Marx quotes is: “Those are my principles, and if you don’t like them…well, I have others.”\nAlthough the humor in this quote is obvious, the security lesson we can learn from it might not be at first glance. I think it is worth delving into, however, as we can take some wisdom from it that we can use in the security field. The lesson is one of applying consistent security policy.\nAs security professionals know, over the last 10-15 years, the complexity of the average enterprise’s infrastructure has exploded.  As multiple different cloud environments have come online, multiple different technology stacks have been implemented in each environment in many cases. Each one of these technology stacks requires knowledge, expertise, and resources to operate and maintain. Never mind the efforts required to extract value from them for the benefit of the security program. As you can imagine, this has created exponential growth in complexity.\nWhile this new reality creates many challenges, there is one challenge in particular that I see enterprises wrestling with nearly universally. Making a change across the modern enterprise is now no longer a relatively simple task. Updating a rule, deploying a new signature, modifying a control, and many other tasks that used to be fairly straightforward in the world of on-premises environments have become logistical nightmares. In many cases, entire teams are dedicated to these activities and are desperately trying to keep up, at the expense of other important security functions.\nWhen it comes to security policy, the pain is particularly acute. The greatest security policies in the world are useless if enterprises don’t have a reasonable, consistent, and reliable way to implement them. Of course, applying policies selectively merely due to complexity should not be acceptable to the security team. There has to be a better way – a way to consistently implement security policies universally, regardless of how complex the infrastructure is.\nIndeed, the new class of solutions dedicated to simplifying complexity in hybrid and multi-cloud environments gives hope that there is a better way. What are some of the benefits of going this route to facilitate consistent security policies? While there are many benefits, here are five strategic ones that I believe it is helpful to understand:\nThere is nothing wrong with having steadfast principles and consistent security policies – in fact, both are honorable.  Of course, this lesson extends far beyond the security profession. For example, if you are outraged when one group experiences discrimination but are silent or even work to justify/encourage discrimination when a different group experiences it, you are making Grouch Marx’s point.  Groucho made that point humorously, of course, and we can learn a lot from it.\nJoshua Goldfarb (Twitter: @ananalytical) is currently Field CISO at F5. Previously, Josh served as VP, CTO - Emerging Technologies at FireEye and as Chief Security Officer for nPulse Technologies until its acquisition by FireEye. Prior to joining nPulse, Josh worked as an independent consultant, applying his analytical methodology to help enterprises build and enhance their network traffic analysis, security operations, and incident response capabilities to improve their information security postures. He has consulted and advised numerous clients in both the public and private sectors at strategic and tactical levels. Earlier in his career, Josh served as the Chief of Analysis for the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) where he built from the ground up and subsequently ran the network, endpoint, and malware analysis/forensics capabilities for US-CERT.\nSubscribe to the SecurityWeek Email Briefing to stay informed on the latest threats, trends, and technology, along with insightful columns from industry experts.\nJoin this event as we dive into threat hunting tools and frameworks, and explore value of threat intelligence data in the defender’s security stack.\nLearn how integrating BAS and Automated Penetration Testing empowers security teams to quickly identify and validate threats, enabling prompt response and remediation.\nApplication security firm Checkmarx has appointed Jonathan Rende as its Chief Product Officer (CPO).\nYuval Fessler has been appointed the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of Claroty.\nAlex Ionescu has returned to CrowdStrike as Chief Technology Innovation Officer (CTIO).\n\n\nWhile often relegated to a purely functional role, DNS offers unparalleled opportunities for preemptive defense against cyberattacks.\n(Danelle Au)\n\n\n\nThe rise of zero-knowledge threat actors powered by AI marks a turning point in the business of cybercrime where sophisticated attacks are no longer confined to skilled attackers.\n(Etay Maor)\n\n\n\nA strong security program will sometimes require substantial organizational and cultural changes around security practices, and inevitably, a higher cost.\n(Trevin Edgeworth)\n\n\n\nInterview with Taylor Pyle, a Cybersecurity Engineer at Viasat on her experience with both cyber and mentorship.\n(Marc Solomon)\n\n\n\nA Joni Mitchell song from the 1960s can teach us a lot about securing hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\n(Joshua Goldfarb)\n\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nGot a confidential news tip?

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nAgentic AI has improved spear phishing effectiveness by 55% since 2023, research shows.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nWe knew it was coming and now it is here: AI-powered spear phishing now outperforms elite human-generated spear phishing, with the real inflection point occurring in early 2025. If we add AI’s ability to operate at vastly improved speed and scale, the outlook for AI-assisted social engineering is daunting. \nSince 2023, Hoxhunt has run ongoing experiments pitting AI-generated spear phishing against expert red team generated spear phishing; and has found a 55% improvement in AI performance. In 2023, when the experiment started, AI was 31% less effective than humans. By March 2025, it was 24% more effective. (Effectiveness is measured by the number of times the spear phishes succeeded in getting the target to ‘click’.)\n\n\n\nThe 2023 results were similar to those returned by a separate study conducted by IBM’s X-Force Red, also in 2023. The IBM study found a human phish achieved a 14% click rate against an 11% click rate from the AI phish, confirming that humans were, at least then, the better phishers. Both experiments were conducted with phishes generated by prompt engineering ChatGPT, because at the time, that was the only generally available way to use AI.\n\n\n\nIBM’s Chief People Hacker at X-Force Red, Snow Carruthers, suggested a primary reason for AI’s failure to move the needle in 2023 was its lack of emotional intelligence. “Humans understand emotions in ways that AI can only dream of. We can weave narratives that tug at the heartstrings and sound more realistic, making recipients more likely to click on a malicious link.”\n\n\n\nBut she added, “I think my biggest takeaway is to question what the future is going to look like. If we continue to improve gen-AI and make it sound more human, these phishing emails are going to be possibly devastating.”\n\n\n\nThat’s exactly what started in 2024 with the arrival of agentic AI and its ability to learn and adapt. Knowing that malicious actors would also switch to agentic AI, Hoxhunt developed its own spear-phishing agent to continue its comparative analysis. It developed an agent it calls JKR (short for Joker) – and the performance of AI-generated spear phishing quickly started to improve against human generated spear phishing. \n\n\n\nIn 2024, Hoxhunt’s experiments demonstrated that AI-generated spear phishing was closing the gap on human-generated spear-phishing. It had dropped from being 31% less efficient than human-generated spear phishing to just 10% less efficient. \n\n\n\nBut 2025 is the real shocker. “The acceleration in AI Spear Phishing Agents’ effectiveness in the 3 months between Nov. 2024 to Feb. 2025 has been eye-opening,” writes Pyry Avist, co-founder and CTO at Hoxhunt. Applying a timeline to this evolution, AI was 31% less effective than humans in 2023, only 10% less effective through 2024, but by March 2025, AI was 24% more effective than humans.Advertisement.

Soon, the phishing-as-a-service market will shift to mass adoption of AI Spear Phishing Agents. Once that happens, the baseline quality and effectiveness of mass phishing campaigns will rise to a level we currently equate with targeted spear phishing attacks.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Social Engineering Gets AI Wings\nRelated: Browser Security Under Siege: The Alarming Rise of AI-Powered Phishing\nRelated: Russian Cyberspies Caught Spear-Phishing with QR Codes, WhatsApp Groups\nRelated: Microsoft Warns of Russian Spear-Phishing Attacks Targeting Over 100 Organizations\n\nSince 2023, Hoxhunt has run ongoing experiments pitting AI-generated spear phishing against expert red team generated spear phishing; and has found a 55% improvement in AI performance. In 2023, when the experiment started, AI was 31% less effective than humans. By March 2025, it was 24% more effective. (Effectiveness is measured by the number of times the spear phishes succeeded in getting the target to ‘click’.)\n\n\n\nThe 2023 results were similar to those returned by a separate study conducted by IBM’s X-Force Red, also in 2023. The IBM study found a human phish achieved a 14% click rate against an 11% click rate from the AI phish, confirming that humans were, at least then, the better phishers. Both experiments were conducted with phishes generated by prompt engineering ChatGPT, because at the time, that was the only generally available way to use AI.\n\n\n\nIBM’s Chief People Hacker at X-Force Red, Snow Carruthers, suggested a primary reason for AI’s failure to move the needle in 2023 was its lack of emotional intelligence. “Humans understand emotions in ways that AI can only dream of. We can weave narratives that tug at the heartstrings and sound more realistic, making recipients more likely to click on a malicious link.”\n\n\n\nBut she added, “I think my biggest takeaway is to question what the future is going to look like. If we continue to improve gen-AI and make it sound more human, these phishing emails are going to be possibly devastating.”\n\n\n\nThat’s exactly what started in 2024 with the arrival of agentic AI and its ability to learn and adapt. Knowing that malicious actors would also switch to agentic AI, Hoxhunt developed its own spear-phishing agent to continue its comparative analysis. It developed an agent it calls JKR (short for Joker) – and the performance of AI-generated spear phishing quickly started to improve against human generated spear phishing. \n\n\n\nIn 2024, Hoxhunt’s experiments demonstrated that AI-generated spear phishing was closing the gap on human-generated spear-phishing. It had dropped from being 31% less efficient than human-generated spear phishing to just 10% less efficient. \n\n\n\nBut 2025 is the real shocker. “The acceleration in AI Spear Phishing Agents’ effectiveness in the 3 months between Nov. 2024 to Feb. 2025 has been eye-opening,” writes Pyry Avist, co-founder and CTO at Hoxhunt. Applying a timeline to this evolution, AI was 31% less effective than humans in 2023, only 10% less effective through 2024, but by March 2025, AI was 24% more effective than humans.Advertisement.

No OCI customer data has been viewed or stolen. No OCI service has been interrupted or compromised in any way,” reads a notification email obtained by security expert Max Solonski. \n\n\n\nHowever, the notification confirmed that “a hacker did access and publish user names from two obsolete servers that were never part of OCI”.Advertisement.

Solonski pointed out that it may still be possible for someone to crack the passwords, and noted that even if the hacker only obtained usernames, that could be considered customer data.\n\n\n\nSecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont, who has been monitoring the incident, has also criticized Oracle, describing its notification as “an exceptionally poor response for a company that manages extremely sensitive data”.\n\n\n\nBeaumont believes the hacker may have targeted servers associated with Oracle Classic (also referred to as Gen1 servers), which is the name used for legacy cloud services. This enables Oracle to categorically deny a breach of OCI.\n\n\n\nSeveral other questions remain unanswered, including the method used to hack Oracle systems and the age of the compromised data. \n\n\n\nAccording to some reports, Oracle systems were breached through the exploitation of an old vulnerability.

One advisory urges customers to replace the Sentron 7KT PAC1260 Data Manager with the newer PAC1261. The former is affected by critical vulnerabilities that can allow an attacker to access files and execute arbitrary code, but it will not receive any patches.\n\n\n\nA critical flaw has also been found in Industrial Edge. The product is affected by a weak authentication issue that “could facilitate an unauthenticated remote attacker to circumvent authentication and impersonate a legitimate user”.\n\n\n\nSiemens has also notified customers about the recently disclosed IngressNightmare vulnerabilities affecting its Insights Hub Private Cloud solution.\n\n\n\nThe company has also informed customers about high-severity issues patched in Sidis Prime and Solid Edge products, as well as medium-severity bugs in Siemens License Server, ICMP industrial devices, and Mendix Runtime.\n\n\n\nSchneider Electric has published two new advisories. One describes two high-severity vulnerabilities in ConneXium Network Manager, including one that can allow remote code execution and DoS attacks on engineering workstations.\n\n\n\nThe second advisory covers three medium-severity flaws in Trio Q Licensed Data Radios that could lead to unauthorized access and the exposure of sensitive information. However, exploitation requires physical access.\n\n\n\nRockwell Automation has published one advisory to inform customers about nearly a dozen local code execution vulnerabilities affecting its Arena product. Exploitation involves tricking the targeted user into opening a malicious file. Advertisement.
