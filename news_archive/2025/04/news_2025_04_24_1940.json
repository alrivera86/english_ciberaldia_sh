        "Content": "At least six organizations in South Korea have been targeted by the prolific North Korea-linked\nLazarus Group\nas part of a campaign dubbed\nOperation SyncHole\n.\nThe activity targeted South Korea's software, IT, financial, semiconductor manufacturing, and telecommunications industries, according to a report from Kaspersky published today. The earliest evidence of compromise was first detected in November 2024.\nThe campaign involved a \"sophisticated combination of a watering hole strategy and vulnerability exploitation within South Korean software,\" security researchers Sojun Ryu and Vasily Berdnikov\nsaid\n. \"A one-day vulnerability in Innorix Agent was also used for lateral movement.\"\nThe attacks have been observed paving the way for variants of known Lazarus tools such as\nThreatNeedle\n,\nAGAMEMNON\n,\nwAgent\n,\nSIGNBT\n, and\nCOPPERHEDGE\n.\nWhat makes these intrusions particularly effective is the likely exploitation of a security vulnerability in Cross EX, a legitimate software prevalent in South Korea to enable the use of security software in online banking and government websites to support anti-keylogging and certificate-based digital signatures.\n\"The Lazarus group shows a strong grasp of these specifics and is using a South Korea-targeted strategy that combines vulnerabilities in such software with watering hole attacks,\" the Russian cybersecurity vendor said.\nThe exploitation of a security flaw in Innorix Agent for lateral movement is notable for the fact that a similar approach has also been\nadopted\nby the\nAndariel sub-cluster\nof the Lazarus Group in the past to deliver malware such as Volgmer and Andardoor.\nThe starting point of the latest wave of attacks is a watering hole attack, which activated the deployment of ThreatNeedle after targets visited various South Korean online media sites. Visitors who land on the sites are filtered using a server-side script prior to redirecting them to an adversary-controlled domain to serve the malware.\n\"We assess with medium confidence that the redirected site may have executed a malicious script, targeting a potential flaw in Cross EX installed on the target PC, and launching malware,\" the researchers said. \"The script then ultimately executed the legitimate SyncHost.exe and injected a shellcode that loaded a variant of ThreatNeedle into that process.\"\nThe infection sequence has been observed adopting two phases, using ThreatNeedle and wAgent in the early stages and then SIGNBT and COPPERHEDGE for establishing persistence, conducting reconnaissance, and delivering credential dumping tools on the compromised hosts.\nAlso deployed are malware families such as LPEClient for victim profiling and payload delivery, and a downloader dubbed Agamemnon for downloading and executing additional payloads received from the command-and-control (C2) server, while simultaneously incorporating the Hell's Gate technique to bypass security solutions during execution.\nOne payload downloaded by Agamemnon is a tool designed to carry out lateral movement by exploiting a security flaw in the Innorix Agent file transfer tool. Kaspersky said its investigation unearthed an additional arbitrary file download zero-day vulnerability in Innorix Agent that has\nsince been patched\nby the developers.\n\"The Lazarus group's specialized attacks targeting supply chains in South Korea are expected to continue in the future,\" Kaspersky said.\n\"The attackers are also making efforts to minimize detection by developing new malware or enhancing existing malware. In particular, they introduce enhancements to the communication with the C2, command structure, and the way they send and receive data.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The Evolving Healthcare Cybersecurity Landscape\nHealthcare organizations face unprecedented cybersecurity challenges in 2025. With operational technology (OT) environments increasingly targeted and the convergence of IT and medical systems creating an expanded attack surface, traditional security approaches are proving inadequate. According to recent statistics, the healthcare sector experienced a record-breaking year for data breaches in 2024, with over 133 million patient records exposed. The average cost of a healthcare data breach has now reached $11 million, making it the most expensive industry for breaches.\nWhat's changed dramatically is the focus of attackers. No longer content with merely extracting patient records, cybercriminals are now targeting the actual devices that deliver patient care. The stakes have never been higher, with ransomware now representing 71% of all attacks against healthcare organizations and causing an average downtime of 11 days per incident.\nNew Regulatory Frameworks Demand Enhanced Security Controls\nHealthcare organizations now face stricter regulatory requirements that specifically mandate network segmentation. The updated\nHIPAA Security Rule\n, published in December 2024 and expected to be implemented shortly, has eliminated the distinction between \"addressable\" and \"required\" implementation specifications. All security measures, including network segmentation, will become mandatory requirements rather than optional considerations.\nUnder section 45 CFR 164.312(a)(2)(vi), healthcare organizations must now implement technical controls to segment their electronic information systems in a \"reasonable and appropriate manner.\" This means creating clear boundaries between operational and IT networks to reduce risks from threats like phishing attacks and prevent lateral movement within networks.\nSimilarly, HHS 405(d) guidelines now provide voluntary cybersecurity practices that specifically recommend network segmentation and access controls to limit exposure and protect critical systems and data. These regulations reflect the growing recognition that in today's interconnected healthcare environment, basic security measures are no longer optional but essential for protecting electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).\nBridging the Gap Between IT Security and Medical Device Teams\nOne of the most significant challenges in healthcare security is the traditional divide between IT security teams and clinical engineering/biomedical teams responsible for medical devices. Each group operates with different priorities, expertise, and operational workflows:\nIT security teams focus on vulnerability management, security policy enforcement, and compliance reporting, while clinical engineering teams prioritize device functionality, patient safety, and medical equipment uptime.\nThis divide creates blind spots in the security posture of healthcare organizations. Clinical devices often run proprietary or legacy operating systems that cannot support traditional security agents. Meanwhile, biomedical teams maintain separate inventory systems that don't communicate with IT security platforms, creating visibility gaps for unmanaged devices.\nAaron Weismann, Chief Information Security Officer at Main Line Health, describes this challenge: \"We have a very difficult time handling non-traditional compute because of not having tooling specifically designed to address and manage those devices. So Elisity really provides a layer of defense and threat mitigation that we wouldn't otherwise have in our environment.\"\nThe Integrated Elisity and Armis Solution: A Comprehensive Approach\nThe integration between Armis Centrix™ and Elisity's\nmicrosegmentation\nplatform creates a powerful security framework that addresses these challenges head-on. By combining comprehensive asset intelligence with Elisity's dynamic microsegmentation capabilities, healthcare organizations can achieve true zero-trust architecture while maintaining operational efficiency.\nComprehensive Asset Discovery and Intelligence\nThe integrated solution provides unmatched visibility across all connected devices—managed, unmanaged, medical, and IoT—without requiring agents or disruptive scanning. Leveraging an Asset Intelligence Engine containing knowledge of over 5 billion devices, the solution automatically discovers and classifies every device on the network, including those that traditional security tools miss.\nThe platform detects and profiles devices ranging from infusion pumps and MRI machines to building systems like HVAC units—anything connected to the network. For each device, the solution identifies critical information such as make, model, operating system, location, connections, FDA classification, and risk factors.\nAs Weismann notes, \"Armis and Elisity have really been able to drive more robust understanding of our security posture and how we're implementing policies across the board.\"\nIdentity-Based Microsegmentation\nElisity delivers identity-based microsegmentation through its cloud-delivered policy management platform, working with existing network infrastructure without requiring new hardware, agents, VLANs, or complex ACLs. The seamless integration enhances the Elisity IdentityGraph™, a comprehensive device, user, workload identity, and attribute database.\nLeveraging detailed asset information (including risk score, boundaries, device type, manufacturer, model, OS, firmware version, and network segment), Elisity enables precise, context-aware security policies across the network.\nWeismann explains the practical benefits: \"We now have the ability to apply policies to all users, workloads and devices when they appear on networks, and we can apply all policies with confidence that we will not disrupt systems or users.\"\nDynamic Policy Automation and Enforcement\nThe joint solution allows security teams to rapidly implement least privilege access through pre-built policy templates or highly granular, dynamic microsegmentation policies that automatically adapt based on device risk levels.\nAccording to Weismann, \"Using our existing blend of Cisco and Juniper switches as policy enforcement points is brilliant—we know our network will remain HA, high performance and we don't have to disrupt our existing network architecture or add choke points.\"\nThe Elisity Dynamic Policy Engine enables security teams to:\nCreate, simulate, and enforce policies that prevent lateral movement\nDynamically update policies based on real-time intelligence\nApply least-privilege access across users, workloads, and devices without operational disruption\nAutomatically adapt to changing risk levels\nMain Line Health: A Success Story\nMain Line Health's implementation of the integrated solution demonstrates the transformative potential of this integration. The healthcare system recently earned both the CIO 100 Award for 2025 and the CSO 50 Award in 2024 for their innovative cybersecurity implementation.\n\"The synergy between Armis and Elisity has fortified defenses against targeted cyber threats, improving overall operational efficiency with added layers of security and visibility,\" says Aaron Weismann. \"Microsegmentation is a key strategy for accelerating our Zero Trust program.\"\nMain Line Health deployed the solution across their entire enterprise—from outpatient facilities to acute care hospitals. What impressed them most was the speed of implementation: \"We were able to deploy Elisity at one of our sites within hours, and by the next day, we were creating and implementing blocking rules. The speed to execution was unbelievable.\"\nThe integration created a powerful security framework that enabled Main Line Health to:\nDiscover and visualize every user, workload, and device across their networks\nGain comprehensive visibility into over 100,000 IoT, OT, and IoMT devices\nEnable dynamic security policies that adapt to changing vulnerabilities\nDeliver frictionless implementation that accelerated their security roadmap\nMeet compliance requirements including HIPAA and HiTrust\nOne revealing insight from their implementation was that their non-traditional computing environment (biomedical devices, IoMT, IoT, OT) vastly outnumbered their traditional IT assets. This reinforced the importance of a security approach that could handle the unique challenges of these specialized devices.\nMeasurable Results and Benefits\nOrganizations implementing the integrated solution have experienced significant improvements in their security posture and operational efficiency:\nAttack Surface Coverage and Visibility\nThe solution provides 99% discovery and visibility of all users, workloads, and devices across IT, IoT, OT, and IoMT environments. This comprehensive visibility closes security gaps and eliminates blind spots, especially for unmanaged devices that traditional security tools miss.\nReduced Risk and Breach Containment\nBy implementing identity-based least privilege access, organizations can limit the blast radius of attacks, contain breaches more effectively, and prevent lateral movement—the technique used in over 70% of successful breaches. This approach is particularly effective against ransomware, which has become the dominant threat to healthcare organizations.\nSimplified Compliance and Reporting\nThe solution streamlines compliance with frameworks like HIPAA, NIST 800-207, and IEC 62443 through comprehensive asset visibility and policy documentation. Automated reporting capabilities enable faster audits with push-button reports per user, workload, and device.\nOperational Efficiency\nPerhaps most importantly, the joint solution enables healthcare organizations to implement microsegmentation in weeks instead of years, without disrupting clinical operations. As GSK's CISO Michael Elmore notes, \"Elisity's deployment at GSK is nothing short of revolutionary, making every other solution pale in comparison.\"\nLooking to the Future of Healthcare Security\nAs we move forward in 2025 and beyond, several trends will shape the evolution of healthcare cybersecurity:\nAI-Driven Security and Response\nAI-driven security solutions are becoming increasingly sophisticated, enabling more accurate threat detection and automated response. The integrated solution provides early warning capabilities and predictive analytics that help organizations stay ahead of emerging threats.\nSeamless IT-OT Integration\nThe convergence of IT and OT security will continue to accelerate, with more comprehensive security coverage across all connected systems. The integration exemplifies this trend, providing a unified view of the entire healthcare device ecosystem.\nSupply Chain Security\nWith third-party attacks accounting for 62% of data breaches in healthcare, securing the supply chain has emerged as a critical concern. Advanced microsegmentation capabilities provide stronger controls over third-party access to networks, helping to mitigate this growing risk vector.\nZero Trust Implementation\nAs Forrester Research recently stated in their Forrester Wave™: Microsegmentation Solutions report, \"We're Living In The Golden Age Of Microsegmentation.\" This approach is crucial for preventing lateral movement and minimizing the impact of east-west attacks in healthcare environments.\nThe Path Forward for Healthcare Security Leaders\nFor healthcare organizations looking to enhance their security posture in 2025, the integrated solution offers a powerful foundation for comprehensive protection. Here are key actions security leaders should consider:\nAssessment Phase\nEvaluate your current network architecture against the new regulatory standards, focusing on areas where additional segmentation controls may be needed. Consider your organization's specific risk profile and how it aligns with the updated HIPAA security rule requirements.\nPlanning Phase\nDevelop a phased implementation plan that addresses immediate compliance needs while building toward a comprehensive segmentation strategy. Consider both technical requirements and operational impacts, ensuring that security improvements don't disrupt critical healthcare services.\nImplementation Considerations\nWork with solution providers who understand healthcare's unique challenges and can demonstrate successful implementations in similar environments. The right partner should offer both technical expertise and a clear understanding of healthcare's regulatory requirements.\nAs Aaron Weismann aptly summarizes: \"We're certainly able to sleep easier at night, especially as we see larger and larger ransomware attacks hit the healthcare vertical. We definitely don't want to be a victim of that, and therefore, anything we could do to mitigate the potential impacts of a cyber attack that could lead to a ransomware attack absolutely give us peace of mind.\"\nBy implementing the integrated solution, healthcare organizations can transform their approach to security—protecting patient data, ensuring clinical operations continuity, and meeting regulatory requirements while adapting to the evolving threat landscape of 2025 and beyond.\nTo guide your journey toward effective microsegmentation, download Elisity's comprehensive\nMicrosegmentation Buyer's Guide and Checklist\n2025.

The purpose is to convince potential victims to provide Microsoft authorization codes that give access to accounts, or to click on malicious links that collect logins and one-time access codes.\nCybersecurity company Volexity observed this activity since early March, right after a similar operation, reported in February by\nVolexity\nand\nMicrosoft\n, that used Device Code Authentication phishing to steal Microsoft 365 accounts.\nVolexity tracks the threat actors responsible for the two campaigns as UTA0352 and UTA0355 and asesses with medium confidence that they are both Russian.\nAttack flow\nIn a report published today, the researchers describe the attack as starting with a message over Signal or WhatsApp. Volexity notes that in one case the communication came from a compromised Ukrainian government account.\nEmail sent to targets\nSource: Volexity\nThe attacker impersonate European political officials or Ukrainian diplomats and lure targets with invitations to private video meetings to discuss Ukraine-related affairs.\nOnce the communication channel established, the attacker sends an OAuth phishing URL under the pretext that it is required for joining the video call.\nMessages sent to targets\nSource: Volexity\nUTA0352 may share instructions to join the meeting in the form of a PDF file along with a malicious URL crafted to log the user into Microsoft and third-party apps that use Microsoft 365 OAuth workflows.\nAfter the target authenticates, they are \"redirected to an in-browser version of Visual Studio Code, hosted at insiders.vscode.dev,\" the researchers explain.\nThe landing page can receive login paramenters from Microsoft 365, which includes OAuth and the target will see the dialog below:\nLanding page providing the OAuth 2.0 authorization code\nSource: Volexity\nUsing social engineering, the attacker tries to trick the victim to send back the code above, under the pretense that it is needed to join the meeting.\nHowever, the string is an authorization code valid for 60 days that can be used to obtain an access token for \"all resources normally available to the user.\"\n\"It should be noted that this code also appeared as part of the URI in the address bar. The Visual Studio Code appears to have been set up to make it easier to extract and share this code, whereas most other instances would simply lead to blank pages,\"\nVolexity\nsays\n.\nThe researchers simplified in the following diagram the attack flow targeting users by relying on a Visual Studio Code first-party application:\nComplete attack flow\nSource: Volexity\nThe research note that there are older variations of the recent phishing attack, where the attacker used a format for the AzureAD v1.0 instead of the v2.0, the differences consisting in the URL parameters used.\nThe campaign in April attributed to UTA0355 is similar to that of UTA0352 but the initial communication came from a compromised Ukrainian government email account and the attacker used the \"stolen OAuth authorization code to register a new device to the victim’s Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).\"\nVolexity researchers say that once the device registered, they had to convince the target to approve the two-factor authentication (2FA) request to be able to access the victim's email.\nTo achieve that, the threat actor social-engineered their way by saying that the 2FA code was necessary to \"gain access to a SharePoint instance associated with the conference.\"\nThis final step gives the attacker a token to access the victim’s information and emails, but also a newly registered device to maintain unauthorized access for a longer period.\n“In logs reviewed by Volexity, initial device registration was successful shortly after interacting with the attacker. Access to email data occurring the following day, which was when UTA0355 had engineered a situation where their 2FA request would be approved,” Volexity researchers say.\nTo protect against such attacks, Volexity advises setting up alerts on logins using the Visual Studio Code\nclient_id\n, block access to ‘\ninsiders.vscode.dev\n’ and ‘\nvscode-redirect.azurewebsites.net\n’.\nThe researchers also recommend setting up conditional access policies to limit access to approved devices only.\nRelated Articles:\nMalicious Adobe, DocuSign OAuth apps target Microsoft 365 accounts\nTycoon2FA phishing kit targets Microsoft 365 with new tricks\nRussian hackers attack Western military mission using malicious drive\nMicrosoft: Exchange Online bug mistakenly quarantines user emails\nHidden Threats: How Microsoft 365 Backups Store Risks for Future Attacks"

        "Content": "In a recent espionage campaign, the infamous North Korean threat group Lazarus targeted multiple organizations in the software, IT, finance, and telecommunications sectors in South Korea.\nThe threat actor combined a watering hole attack strategy with an exploit for a vulnerability in a file transfer client that is required in South Korea to complete certain financial and administrative tasks.\nResearchers at Kasperky named the campaign 'Operation SyncHole' and say that the activity compromised at least half a dozen organizations between November 2024 and February 2025.\n“We identified at least six software, IT, financial, semiconductor manufacturing and telecommunication organizations in South Korea that fell victim to “Operation SyncHole,” Kasperky notes in a\nreport\n.\nOperation SyncHole activity timeline\nSource: Kaspersky\n“However, we are confident that there are many more affected organizations across a broader range of industries, given the popularity of the software exploited by Lazarus in this campaign,” the researchers added.\nAccording to Kaspersky, Lazarus hackers used an exploit that was known by the vendor at the time of the investigation, but it had been leveraged before in other attacks.\nTarget selection\nThe attack started with targets visiting legitimate South Korean media portals that Lazarus had compromised with server-side scripts for profiling visitors and redirecting valid targets to malicious domains.\nIn the incidents analyzed by Kaspersky, victims are redirected to sites that mimick software vendors, such as the distributor of Cross EX - a tool that enables South Koreans to use security software in various web browsers for online banking and interactions with government websites.\n“Although the exact method by which Cross EX was exploited to deliver malware remains unclear, we believe that the attackers escalated their privileges during the exploitation process as we confirmed the process was executed with high integrity level in most cases,”\nexplained\nKaspersky.\nSite that triggers the initial infection\nSource: Kaspersky\nThe researchers say that a malicious JavaScript on the fake website exploits the Cross EX software to deliver malware.\nAlthough Kaspersky did not find the exact exploitation method used, the researchers \"believe that the attackers escalated their privileges during the exploitation process.\"\nFurthermore, \"according to a recent\nsecurity advisory\nposted on the KrCERT website, there appear to be recently patched vulnerabilities in Cross EX, which were addressed during the timeframe of our research,\" Kaspersky's report notes.\nThe exploit launches the legitimate ‘SyncHost.exe’ process and injects shellcode in it to load the ‘ThreatNeedle’ backdoor, which can execute 37 commands on the infected host.\nThe attack flow\nSource: Kaspersky\nKaspersky observed multiple infection chains across the six confirmed victims, which differ in earlier and later phases of the attack, only the initial infection being the common ground.\nIn the first phase, ThreatNeedle was used to deploy ‘LPEClient’ for system profiling, the ‘wAgent’ or ‘Agamemnon’ malware downloaders, and the ‘Innorix Abuser’ tool for lateral movement.\nKaspersky notes that Innorix Abuser exploited a vulnerability in the Innorix Agent file transfer solution version 9.2.18.496 and addressed in the latest version of the software.\nIn some cases, ThreatNeedle wasn’t used at all, with Lazarus instead using the ‘SIGNBT’ implant to deploy the ‘Copperhedge’ backdoor used for internal reconnaissance.\nVarious attack chains observed\nSource: Kaspersky\nBased on the tooling used in Operation SyncHole attacks, Kaspersky was able to confidently attribute the compromises to the Lazarus hacker group backed by the North Korean government.\nAdditional clues pointing to the threat actor were the working hours/apparent timezone along with techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) specific to Lazarus.\nBased on the recent malware samples used in Operation SyncHole, Kaspersky observed that Lazarus is moving towards lightweight and modular tools that are both stealthier and more configurable.\nThe cybersecurity firm says it has communicated its findings to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KrCERT/CC) and confirmed that patches have been released for the software exploited in this campaign.\nDuring the attack analysis, Kaspersky researchers also found a non-exploited zero-day flaw (\nKVE-2024-0014\n) in Innorix Agent versions 9.2.18.001 through 9.2.18.538, which allowed arbitrary file downloads.\nThe researchers reported the security issue responsibly through the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KrCERT) and the vendor addressed it in an update last month.\nRelated Articles:\nIvanti Connect Secure zero-days exploited to deploy custom malware\nNew Windows zero-day exploited by 11 state hacking groups since 2017\nUnpatched Edimax IP camera flaw actively exploited in botnet attacks\nActive!

It was introduced in 2019 with Linux 5.1 to address performance and scalability issues with the traditional I/O system.\nInstead of relying on system calls that cause a lot of overhead and process hangs, io_uring uses ring buffers shared between programs and the system kernel to queue up I/O requests that will be processed asynchronously, allowing the program to keep running.\nio_uring task submission and completion rings\nSource: Donald Hunter\nThe problem, according to ARMO, arises from the fact that most security tools monitor for suspicious syscalls and hooking (like 'ptrace' or 'seccomp'), completely ignoring anything that involves the io_ring, creating a very dangerous blindspot.\nThe researchers explain that io_uring supports a\nwide range of operations\nthrough 61 ops types, including file read/writes, creating and accepting network connections, spawning processes, modifying file permissions, and reading directory contents, making it a powerful rootkit vector.\nSuch is the risk that Google decided to\nturn it off by default\non Android and ChromeOS, which use the Linux kernel and inherit many of its underlying vulnerabilities.\nTo put theory into testing, ARMO created Curing, a special-purpose rootkit that abuses io_uring to pull commands from a remote server and execute arbitrary operations without triggering syscall hooks.\nTesting Curing against several well-known runtime security tools demonstrated that most couldn't detect its activity.\nSpecifically, Falco was found to be entirely blind even when custom detection rules were used, while Tetragon showed an inability to flag malicious activity under the default configuration.\nTetragon, though, does not consider its platform vulnerable as monitoring can be enabled to detect this rootkit.\n\"We reported this to the Tetragon team and their response was that from their perspective Tetragon is not \"vulnerable\" as they provide the flexibility to hook basically anywhere,\" explains the researchers.\n\"They pointed out a good\nblog post\nthey wrote about the subject.\"\nTesting against commercial tools, ARMO further confirmed the inability to detect io_uring-based malware and kernel interactions that don't involve syscalls. However, ARMO did not share what commercial programs they tested again.\nFor those who want to test their environments against this threat, ARMO has made Curing\navailable for free on GitHub\n.\nARMO suggests that the problem can be solved with the adoption of Kernel Runtime Security Instrumentation (KRSI), which allows eBPF programs to be attached to security-relevant kernel events.\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft uses AI to find flaws in GRUB2, U-Boot, Barebox bootloaders\nNew Ubuntu Linux security bypasses require manual mitigations\nRansomware gang encrypted network from a webcam to bypass EDR\nNew Auto-Color Linux backdoor targets North American govts, universities\nGoogle adds Android auto-reboot to block forensic data extractions"
