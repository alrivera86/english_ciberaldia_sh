        "Content": "Microsoft is warning of several phishing campaigns that are leveraging tax-related themes to deploy malware and steal credentials.\n\"These campaigns notably use redirection methods such as URL shorteners and QR codes contained in malicious attachments and abuse legitimate services like file-hosting services and business profile pages to avoid detection,\" Microsoft\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\nA notable aspect of these campaigns is that they lead to phishing pages that are delivered via a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform codenamed\nRaccoonO365\n, an e-crime platform that first came to light in early December 2024.\nAlso delivered are remote access trojans (RATs) like Remcos RAT, as well as other malware and post-exploitation frameworks such as\nLatrodectus\n, AHKBot,\nGuLoader\n, and\nBruteRatel C4\n(BRc4).\nOne such campaign spotted by the tech giant on February 6, 2025, is estimated to have sent hundreds of emails targeting the United States ahead of the tax filing season that attempted to deliver BRc4 and Latrodectus. The activity has been attributed to\nStorm-0249\n, an initial access broker previously known for distributing BazaLoader, IcedID, Bumblebee, and Emotet.\nThe attacks involve the use of PDF attachments containing a link that redirects users to a URL shortened via Rebrandly, ultimately leading them to a fake Docusign page with an option to view or download the document.\n\"When users clicked the Download button on the landing page, the outcome depended on whether their system and IP address were allowed to access the next stage based on filtering rules set up by the threat actor,\" Microsoft said.\nIf access is allowed, the user is sent a JavaScript file that subsequently downloads a Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) for BRc4, which serves as a conduit for deploying Latrodectus. If the victim is not deemed a valuable enough target, they are sent a benign PDF document from royalegroupnyc[.]com.\nMicrosoft said it also detected a second campaign between February 12 and 28, 2025, where tax-themed phishing emails were sent to more than 2,300 organizations in the U.S., particularly aimed at engineering, IT, and consulting sectors.\nThe emails, in this case, had no content in the message body, but featured a PDF attachment containing a QR code that pointed to a link associated with the RaccoonO365 PhaaS that mimics Microsoft 365 login pages to trick users into entering their credentials.\nIn a sign that these campaigns come in various forms, tax-themed phishing emails have also been flagged as propagating other malware families like AHKBot and GuLoader.\nAHKBot infection chains have been found to direct users to sites hosting a malicious Microsoft Excel file that, upon opening and enabling macros, downloads and runs a MSI file in order to launch an AutoHotKey script, which then downloads a Screenshotter module to capture screenshots from the compromised host and exfiltrate them to a remote server.\nThe GuLoader campaign aims to deceive users into clicking on a URL present within a PDF email attachment, resulting in the download of a ZIP file.\n\"The ZIP file contained various .lnk files set up to mimic tax documents. If launched by the user, the .lnk file uses PowerShell to download a PDF and a .bat file,\" Microsoft said. \"The .bat file in turn downloaded the GuLoader executable, which then installed Remcos.\"\nThe development comes weeks after Microsoft warned of another Storm-0249 campaign that redirected users to fake websites advertising Windows 11 Pro to deliver an updated version of Latrodectus loader malware via the BruteRatel red-teaming tool.\n\"The threat actor likely used Facebook to drive traffic to the fake Windows 11 Pro download pages, as we observed Facebook referrer URLs in multiple cases,\" Microsoft\nsaid\nin a series of posts on X.\n\"Latrodectus 1.9, the malware's latest evolution first observed in February 2025, reintroduced the scheduled task for persistence and added command 23, enabling the execution of Windows commands via 'cmd.exe /c .'\"\nThe disclosure also follows a surge in campaigns that use QR codes in phishing documents to disguise malicious URLs as part of widespread attacks aimed at Europe and the U.S., resulting in credential theft.\n\"Analysis of the URLs extracted from the QR codes in these campaigns reveals that attackers typically avoid including URLs that directly point to the phishing domain,\" Palo Alto Networks Unit 42\nsaid\nin a report. \"Instead, they often use URL redirection mechanisms or exploit\nopen redirects\non legitimate websites.\"\nThese findings also come in the wake of several phishing and social engineering campaigns that have been flagged in recent weeks -\nUse of the browser-in-the-browser (\nBitB\n) technique to\nserve\nseemingly realistic browser pop-ups that trick players of Counter-Strike 2 into entering their Steam credentials with the likely goal of reselling access to these accounts for profit\nUse of information stealer malware to\nhijack MailChimp accounts\n, permitting threat actors to send email messages in bulk\nUse of\nSVG files\nto bypass spam filters and redirect users to fake Microsoft login pages\nUse of\ntrusted collaboration services\nlike Adobe, DocuSign, Dropbox, Canva, and Zoho to sidestep secure email gateways (SEGs) and steal credentials\nUse of\nemails spoofing music streaming services\nlike Spotify and Apple Music with the goal of harvesting credentials and payment information\nUse of fake security warnings related to suspicious activity on\nWindows\nand\nApple Mac\ndevices on bogus websites to deceive users into providing their system credentials\nUse of\nfake websites\ndistributing trojanized Windows installers for DeepSeek, i4Tools, and Youdao Dictionary Desktop Edition that drop\nGh0st RAT\nUse of\nbilling-themed phishing emails\ntargeting Spanish companies to distribute an information stealer named\nDarkCloud\nUse of\nphishing emails impersonating a Romanian bank\nto deploy an information stealer called Masslogger targeting organizations located in Romania\nTo mitigate the risks posed by these attacks, it's essential that organizations adopt phishing-resistant authentication methods for users, use browsers that can block malicious websites, and enable network protection to prevent applications or users from accessing malicious domains.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The North Korean threat actors behind Contagious Interview have adopted the increasingly popular\nClickFix\nsocial engineering tactic to lure job seekers in the cryptocurrency sector to deliver a previously undocumented Go-based backdoor called GolangGhost on Windows and macOS systems.\nThe new activity, assessed to be a continuation of the campaign, has been codenamed\nClickFake Interview\nby French cybersecurity company Sekoia.\nContagious Interview\n, also tracked as DeceptiveDevelopment, DEV#POPPER, and Famous Chollima, is known to be active since at least December 2022, although it was only publicly documented for the first time in late 2023.\n\"It uses legitimate job interview websites to leverage the ClickFix tactic and install Windows and macOS backdoors,\" Sekoia researchers Amaury G., Coline Chavane, and Felix Aimé\nsaid\n, attributing the effort to the infamous\nLazarus Group\n, a prolific adversary attributed to the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\nA notable aspect of the campaign is that it primarily targets centralized finance entities by impersonating companies like Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, Circle, Securitize, BlockFi, Tether, Robinhood, and Bybit, marking a departure from the hacking group's attacks against decentralized finance (DeFi) entities.\nContagious Interview, like\nOperation Dream Job\n, employs\nfake job offers\nas lures to attract prospective targets and dupe them into downloading malware that can steal cryptocurrency and other sensitive data.\nAs part of the effort, candidates are approached via LinkedIn or X to prepare for a video call interview, for which they are asked to download a malware-laced videoconferencing software or open-source project that activates the infection process.\nLazarus Group's use of the ClickFix tactic was first disclosed towards the end of 2024 by security researcher Taylor Monahan, with the attack chains leading to the deployment of a family of malware called\nFERRET\nthat then delivers the Golang backdoor.\nIn this iteration of the campaign, victims are asked to visit a purported video interviewing service named Willo and complete a video assessment of themselves.\n\"The entire setup, meticulously designed to build user trust, proceeds smoothly until the user is asked to enable their camera,\" Sekoia explained. \"At this point, an error message appears indicating that the user needs to download a driver to fix the issue. This is where the operator employs the ClickFix technique.\"\nThe instructions given to the victim to enable access to the camera or microphone vary depending on the operating system used. On Windows, the targets are prompted to open Command Prompt and execute a curl command to execute a Visual Basic Script (VBS) file, which then launches a batch script to run GolangGhost.\nIn the event the victim is visiting the site from a macOS machine, they are similarly asked to launch the Terminal app and run a curl command to run a shell script. The malicious shell script, for its part, runs a second shell script that, in turn, executes a stealer module dubbed FROSTYFERRET (aka ChromeUpdateAlert) and the backdoor.\nFROSTYFERRET displays a fake window stating the Chrome web browser needs access to the user's camera or microphone, after which it displays a prompt to enter the system password. The entered information, regardless of whether it's valid or otherwise, is exfiltrated to a Dropbox location, likely indicating an attempt to access the iCloud Keychain using the stolen password.\nGolangGhost is engineered to facilitate remote control and data theft through several commands that allow it to upload/download files, send host information, and steal web browser data.\n\"It was found that all the positions were not related to technical profiles in software development,\" Sekia noted. \"They are mainly jobs of manager focusing on business development, asset management, product development or decentralised finance specialists.\"\n\"This is a significant change from previous documented campaigns attributed to DPRK-nexus threat actors and based on fake job interviews, which mainly targeted developers and software engineers.\"\nNorth Korea IT Worker Scheme Becomes Active in Europe\nThe development comes as the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) said it has observed a surge in the\nfraudulent IT worker scheme\nin Europe, underscoring a significant expansion of their operations beyond the United States.\nThe IT worker activity entails North Korean nationals posing as legitimate remote workers to infiltrate companies and generate illicit revenue for Pyongyang in\nviolation of international sanctions\n.\nIncreased awareness\nof the activity, coupled with the\nU.S. Justice Department indictments\n, have instigated a \"global expansion of IT worker operations,\" Google said, noting it uncovered several fabricated personas seeking employment in various organizations located in Germany and Portugal.\nThe IT workers have also been observed undertaking various projects in the United Kingdom related to web development, bot development, content management system (CMS) development, and blockchain technology, often falsifying their identities and claiming to be from Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Ukraine, the United States, and Vietnam.\nThis tactic of IT workers posing as Vietnamese, Japanese, and Singaporean nationals was also\nhighlighted\nby managed intelligence firm Nisos early last month, while drawing attention to their use of GitHub to carve new personas or recycle portfolio content from older personas to reinforce their new ones.\n\"IT workers in Europe were recruited through various online platforms, including Upwork, Telegram, and Freelancer,\" Jamie Collier, Lead Threat Intelligence Advisor for Europe at GTIG,\nsaid\n. \"Payment for their services was facilitated through cryptocurrency, the TransferWise service, and Payoneer, highlighting the use of methods that obfuscate the origin and destination of funds.\"\nBesides using local facilitators to help them land jobs, the insider threat operation is witnessing what appears to be a spike in\nextortion attempts\nsince October 2024, when it became public knowledge that these IT workers are resorting to ransom payments from their employers to prevent them from releasing proprietary data or to provide it to a competitor.\nIn what appears to be a further evolution of the scheme, the IT workers are now said to be targeting companies that operate a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy owing to the fact that such devices are unlikely to have traditional security and logging tools used in enterprise environments.\n\"Europe needs to wake up fast. Despite being in the crosshairs of IT worker operations, too many perceive this as a US problem. North Korea's recent shifts likely stem from US operational hurdles, showing IT workers' agility and ability to adapt to changing circumstances,\" Collier said.\n\"A decade of diverse cyberattacks precedes North Korea's latest surge - from SWIFT targeting and ransomware, to cryptocurrency theft and supply chain compromise. This relentless innovation demonstrates a longstanding commitment to fund the regime through cyber operations.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "AI holds the promise to revolutionize all sectors of enterpriseーfrom fraud detection and content personalization to customer service and security operations. Yet, despite its potential, implementation often stalls behind a wall of security, legal, and compliance hurdles.\nImagine this\nall-too-familiar scenario\n: A CISO wants to deploy an AI-driven SOC to handle the overwhelming volume of security alerts and potential attacks. Before the project can begin, it must pass through layers of GRC (governance, risk, and compliance) approval, legal reviews, and funding hurdles. This gridlock delays innovation, leaving organizations without the\nbenefits of an AI-powered SOC\nwhile cybercriminals keep advancing.\nLet's break down why AI adoption faces such resistance, distinguish genuine risks from bureaucratic obstacles, and explore practical collaboration strategies between vendors, C-suite, and GRC teams.\nWe'll also provide tips from CISOs who have dealt with these issues extensively as well as a cheat sheet of questions AI vendors must answer to satisfy enterprise gatekeepers.\nCompliance as the primary barrier to AI adoption\nSecurity and compliance concerns consistently top the list of reasons why enterprises hesitate to invest in AI. Industry leaders like\nCloudera\nand\nAWS\nhave documented this trend across sectors, revealing a pattern of innovation paralysis driven by regulatory uncertainty.\nWhen you dig deeper into why AI compliance creates such roadblocks, three interconnected challenges emerge. First,\nregulatory uncertainty\nkeeps shifting the goalposts for your compliance teams. Consider how your European operations might have just adapted to\nGDPR\nrequirements, only to face entirely new\nAI Act\nprovisions with different risk categories and compliance benchmarks. If your organization is international, this\npuzzle of regional AI legislation and policies\nonly becomes more complex. In addition,\nframework inconsistencies\ncompound these difficulties. Your team might spend weeks preparing extensive documentation on data provenance, model architecture, and testing parameters for one jurisdiction, only to discover that this documentation is not portable across regions or is not up-to-date anymore. Lastly, the\nexpertise gap\nmay be the biggest hurdle. When a CISO asks who understands both regulatory frameworks and technical implementation, typically the silence is telling. Without professionals who bridge both worlds, translating compliance requirements into practical controls becomes a costly guessing game.\nThese challenges affect your entire organization: developers face extended approval cycles, security teams struggle with AI-specific vulnerabilities like prompt injection, and GRC teams who have the difficult task of safeguarding their organization take increasingly conservative positions without established benchmarks. Meanwhile, cybercriminals face no such constraints, rapidly adopting AI to enhance attacks while your defensive capabilities remain locked behind compliance reviews.\nAI Governance challenges: Separating myth from reality\nWith so much uncertainty surrounding AI regulations, how do you distinguish real risks from unnecessary fears? Let's cut through the noise and examine what you should be worrying about—and what you can let be. Here are some examples:\nFALSE:\n\"AI governance requires a whole new framework.\"\nOrganizations often create entirely new security frameworks for AI systems, unnecessarily duplicating controls. In most cases, existing security controls apply to AI systems—with only incremental adjustments needed for data protection and AI-specific concerns.\nTRUE:\n\"AI-related compliance needs frequent updates.\"\nAs the AI ecosystem and underlying regulations keep shifting, so does AI governance. While compliance is dynamic, organizations can still handle updates without overhauling their entire strategy.\nFALSE:\n\"We need absolute regulatory certainty before using AI.\"\nWaiting for complete regulatory clarity delays innovation. Iterative development is key, as AI policy will continue evolving, and waiting means falling behind.\nTRUE:\n\"AI systems need continuous monitoring and security testing.\"\nTraditional security tests don't capture AI-specific risks like adversarial examples and prompt injection. Ongoing evaluation—including red teaming—is critical to identify bias and reliability issues.\nFALSE:\n\"We need a 100-point checklist before approving an AI vendor.\"\nDemanding a 100-point checklist for vendor approval creates bottlenecks. Standardized evaluation frameworks like\nNIST's AI Risk Management Framework\ncan streamline assessments.\nTRUE:\n\"Liability in high-risk AI applications is a big risk.\"\nDetermining accountability when AI errors occur is complex, as errors can stem from training data, model design, or deployment practices. When it's unclear who is responsible—your vendor, your organization, or the end-user—careful risk management is necessary.\nEffective AI governance should prioritize technical controls that address genuine risks—not create unnecessary roadblocks that keep you stuck while others move forward.\nThe way forward: Driving AI innovation with Governance\nOrganizations that adopt AI governance early gain significant competitive advantages in efficiency, risk management, and customer experience over those that treat compliance as a separate, final step.\nTake\nJPMorgan Chase's AI Center of Excellence (CoE)\nas an example. By leveraging risk-based assessments and standardized frameworks through a centralized AI governance approach, they've streamlined the AI adoption process with expedited approvals and minimal compliance review times.\nMeanwhile, for organizations that delay implementing effective AI governance, the cost of inaction grows daily:\nIncreased security risks:\nWithout AI-powered security solutions, your organization becomes increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated, AI-driven cyber attacks that traditional tools cannot detect or mitigate effectively.\nLost opportunities:\nFailing to innovate with AI results in lost opportunities for cost savings, process optimization, and market leadership as competitors leverage AI for competitive advantage.\nRegulatory debt:\nFuture tightening of regulations will increase compliance burdens, forcing rushed implementations under less favorable conditions and potentially higher costs.\nInefficient late adoption:\nRetroactive compliance often comes with less favorable terms, requiring substantial rework of systems already in production.\nBalancing governance with innovation is critical: as competitors standardize AI-powered solutions, you can ensure your market share through more secure, efficient operations and enhanced customer experiences powered by AI and future-proofed through AI governance.\nHow can vendors, executives and GRC teams work together to unlock AI adoption?\nAI adoption works best when your security, compliance, and technical teams collaborate from day one. Based on conversations we've had with CISOs, we'll break down the top three key governance challenges and offer practical solutions.\nWho should be responsible for AI Governance in your organization?\nAnswer:\nCreate shared accountability through cross-functional teams: CIOs, CISOs, and GRC can work together within an AI Center of Excellence (CoE).\nAs one CISO candidly told us: \"GRC teams get nervous when they hear 'AI' and use boilerplate question lists that slow everything down. They're just following their checklist without any nuance, creating a real bottleneck.\"\nWhat organizations can do in practice:\nForm an AI governance committee with people from security, legal, and business.\nCreate shared metrics and language that everyone understands to track AI risk and value.\nSet up joint security and compliance reviews so teams align from day one.\nHow can vendors make data processing more transparent?\nAnswer:\nBuild privacy and security into your design from the ground up so that common GRC requirements are already addressed from day 1.\nAnother CISO was crystal clear about their concerns: \"Vendors need to explain how they'll protect my data and whether it will be used by their LLM models. Is it opt-in or opt-out? And if there's an accident—if sensitive data is accidentally included in the training—how will they notify me?\"\nWhat organizations acquiring AI solutions can do in practice:\nUse your existing data governance policies instead of creating brand-new structures (see next question).\nBuild and maintain a simple registry of your AI assets and use cases.\nMake sure your data handling procedures are transparent and well-documented.\nDevelop clear incident response plans for AI-related breaches or misuse.\nAre existing exemptions to privacy laws also applicable to AI tools?\nAnswer:\nConsult with your legal counsel or privacy officer.\nThat said, an experienced CISO in the financial industry explained, \"There is a carve out within the law for processing private data when it's being done for the benefit of the customer or out of contractual necessity. As I have a legitimate business interest in servicing and protecting our clients, I may use their private data for that express purpose and I already do so with other tools such as Splunk.\" He added, \"This is why it's so frustrating that additional roadblocks are thrown up for AI tools. Our data privacy policy should be the same across the board.\"\nHow can you ensure compliance without killing innovation?\nAnswer:\nImplement structured but agile governance with periodic risk assessments.\nOne CISO offered this practical suggestion: \"AI vendors can help by proactively providing answers to common questions and explanations for why certain concerns aren't valid. This lets buyers provide answers to their compliance team quickly without long back-and-forths with vendors.\"\nWhat AI vendors can do in practice:\nFocus on the \"common ground\" requirements that appear in most AI policies.\nRegularly review your compliance procedures to cut out redundant or outdated steps.\nStart small with pilot projects that prove both security compliance and business value.\n7 questions AI vendors need to answer to get past enterprise GRC teams\nAt Radiant Security, we understand that evaluating AI vendors can be complex. Over numerous conversations with CISOs, we've gathered a core set of questions that have proven invaluable in clarifying vendor practices and ensuring robust AI governance across enterprises.\n1. How do you ensure our data won't be used to train your AI models?\n\"By default, your data is never used for training our models. We maintain strict data segregation with technical controls that prevent accidental inclusion. If any incident occurs, our data lineage tracking will trigger immediate notification to your security team within 24 hours, followed by a detailed incident report.\"\n2. What specific security measures protect data processed by your AI system?\n\"Our AI platform uses end-to-end encryption both in transit and at rest. We implement strict access controls and regular security testing, including red team exercises; we also maintain SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP certifications. All customer data is logically isolated with strong tenant separation.\"\n3. How do you prevent and detect AI hallucinations or false positives?\n\"We implement multiple safeguards: retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with authoritative knowledge bases, confidence scoring for all outputs, human verification workflows for high-risk decisions, and continuous monitoring that flags anomalous outputs for review. We also conduct regular red team exercises to test the system under adversarial conditions.\"\n4. Can you demonstrate compliance with regulations relevant to our industry?\n\"Our solution is designed to support compliance with GDPR, CCPA, NYDFS, and SEC requirements. We maintain a compliance matrix mapping our controls to specific regulatory requirements and undergo regular third-party assessments. Our legal team tracks regulatory developments and provides quarterly updates on compliance enhancements.\"\n5. What happens if there's an AI-related security breach?\n\"We have a dedicated AI incident response team with 24/7 coverage. Our process includes immediate containment, root cause analysis, customer notification within contractually agreed timeframes (typically 24-48 hours), and remediation. We also conduct tabletop exercises quarterly to test our response capabilities.\"\n6. How do you ensure fairness and prevent bias in your AI systems?\n\"We implement a comprehensive bias prevention framework that includes diverse training data, explicit fairness metrics, regular bias audits by third parties, and fairness-aware algorithm design. Our documentation includes detailed model cards that highlight limitations and potential risks.\"\n7. Will your solution play nicely with our existing security tools?\n\"Our platform offers native integrations with major SIEM platforms, identity providers, and security tools through standard APIs and pre-built connectors. We provide comprehensive integration documentation and dedicated implementation support to ensure seamless deployment.\"\nBridging the gap: AI innovation meets Governance\nAI adoption isn't stalled by technical limitations anymore—it's delayed by compliance and legal uncertainties. But AI innovation and governance aren't enemies. They can actually strengthen each other when you approach them right.\nOrganizations that build practical, risk-informed AI governance aren't just checking compliance boxes but securing a real competitive edge by deploying AI solutions faster, more securely, and with greater business impact.\nFor your security operations, AI may be the single most important differentiator in future-proofing your security posture.\nWhile cybercriminals are already using AI to enhance their attacks' sophistication and speed, can you afford to fall behind?\nMaking this work requires real collaboration: Vendors must address compliance concerns proactively, C-suite executives should champion responsible innovation, and GRC teams need to transition from gatekeepers to enablers. This partnership unlocks AI's transformative potential while maintaining the trust and security that customers demand.\nAbout Radiant Security\nRadiant Security provides an AI-powered SOC platform designed for SMB and enterprise security teams looking to fully handle 100% of the alerts they receive from multiple tools and sensors.

It has been addressed in Quick Share for Windows version 1.0.2002.2 following responsible disclosure in August 2024.\nA consequence of these 10 vulnerabilities, collectively tracked as CVE-2024-38271 (CVSS score: 5.9) and CVE-2024-38272 (CVSS score: 7.1), was that they could have been fashioned into an exploit chain to obtain arbitrary code execution on Windows hosts.\nQuick Share (previously Nearby Share) is a\npeer-to-peer file-sharing utility\nsimilar to Apple AirDrop that allows users to transfer files, photos, videos, and other documents between Android devices, Chromebooks, and Windows desktops and laptops in close physical proximity.\nA follow-up analysis by the cybersecurity company found that two of the vulnerabilities were not fixed correctly, once again causing the application to crash or bypass the need for a recipient to accept a file transfer request by directly transmitting a file to the device instead.\nSpecifically, the DoS bug could be triggered by using a file name that starts with a different invalid UTF8 continuation byte (e.g., \"\\xc5\\xff\") instead of a file name that begins with a NULL terminator (\"\\x00\").\nOn the other hand, the initial fix for the unauthorized file write vulnerability marked such transferred files as \"unknown\" and deleted them from the disk after the file transfer session was complete.\nThis, SafeBreach researcher Or Yair said, could be circumvented by sending two different files in the same session with the same \"payload ID,\" causing the application to delete only one of them, leaving the other intact in the Downloads folder.\n\"While this research is specific to the Quick Share utility, we believe the implications are relevant to the software industry as a whole and suggest that even when code is complex, vendors should always address the real root cause of vulnerabilities that they fix,\" Yair said.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Counterfeit versions of popular smartphone models that are sold at reduced prices have been found to be preloaded with a modified version of an Android malware called\nTriada\n.\n\"More than 2,600 users in different countries have encountered the new version of Triada, the majority in Russia,\" Kaspersky\nsaid\nin a report. The infections were recorded between March 13 and 27, 2025.\nTriada is the name given to a modular Android malware family that was\nfirst discovered\nby the Russian cybersecurity company in March 2016. A remote access trojan (RAT), it's equipped to steal a wide range of sensitive information, as well as enlist infected devices into a botnet for other malicious activities.\nWhile the malware was previously observed being distributed via intermediate apps published on the Google Play Store (and elsewhere) that\ngained root access\nto the compromised phones, subsequent campaigns have leveraged WhatsApp mods like\nFMWhatsApp\nand\nYoWhatsApp\nas a propagation vector.\nOver the years, altered versions of Triada have also found their way into off-brand Android tablets, TV boxes, and digital projectors as part of a widespread\nfraud scheme\ncalled\nBADBOX\nthat has leveraged hardware supply chain compromises and third-party marketplaces for initial access.\nThis behavior was\nfirst observed\nin 2017, when the malware evolved to a pre-installed Android framework backdoor, allowing the threat actors to remotely control the devices, inject more malware, and exploit them for various illicit activities.\n\"Triada infects device system images through a third-party during the production process,\" Google\nnoted\nin June 2019. \"Sometimes OEMs want to include features that aren't part of the Android Open Source Project, such as face unlock. The OEM might partner with a third-party that can develop the desired feature and send the whole system image to that vendor for development.\"\nThe tech giant, at that time, also pointed fingers at a vendor that went by the name Yehuo or Blazefire as the party likely responsible for infecting the returned system image with Triada.\nThe latest samples of the malware analyzed by Kaspersky show that they are located in the system framework, thus allowing it to be copied to every process on the smartphone and giving the attackers unfettered access and control to perform various activities -\nSteal user accounts associated with instant messengers and social networks, such as Telegram and TikTok\nStealthily send WhatsApp and Telegram messages to other contacts on behalf of the victim and delete them in order to remove traces\nAct as a clipper by hijacking clipboard content with cryptocurrency wallet addresses to replace them with a wallet under their control\nMonitor web browser activity and replace links\nReplace phone numbers during calls\nIntercept SMS messages and subscribe victims to premium SMS\nDownload other programs\nBlock network connections to interfere with the normal functioning of anti-fraud systems\nIt's worth noting that Triada is not the only malware that has been preloaded on Android devices during the manufacturing stages. In May 2018, Avast\nrevealed\nthat several hundred Android models, including those from like ZTE and Archos, were shipped pre-installed with another adware called Cosiloon.\n\"The Triada Trojan has been known for a long time, and it still remains one of the most complex and dangerous threats to Android,\" Kaspersky researcher Dmitry Kalinin said. \"Probably, at one of the stages, the supply chain is compromised, so stores may not even suspect that they are selling smartphones with Triada.\"\n\"At the same time, the authors of the new version of Triada are actively monetizing their efforts. Judging by the analysis of transactions, they were able to transfer about $270,000 in various cryptocurrencies to their crypto wallets [between June 13, 2024, to March 27, 2025].\"\nThe emergence of an updated version of Triada follows the discovery of two different Android banking trojans called\nCrocodilus\nand\nTsarBot\n, the latter of which targets over 750 banking, financial, and cryptocurrency applications.\nBoth the malware families are distributed via dropper apps that impersonate legitimate Google services. They also abuse Android's accessibility services to remotely control the infected devices, and conduct overlay attacks to siphon banking credentials and credit card details.\nThe disclosure also comes as ANY.RUN detailed a new Android malware strain dubbed\nSalvador Stealer\nthat masquerades as a banking application catering to Indian users (package name: \"\ncom.indusvalley.appinstall\n\") and is capable of harvesting sensitive user information.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Threat hunters are warning of a sophisticated\nweb skimmer campaign\nthat leverages a legacy application programming interface (API) from payment processor Stripe to validate stolen payment information prior to exfiltration.\n\"This tactic ensures that only valid card data is sent to the attackers, making the operation more efficient and potentially harder to detect,\" Jscrambler researchers Pedro Fortuna, David Alves, and Pedro Marrucho\nsaid\nin a report.\nAs many as 49 merchants are estimated to have been affected by the campaign to date. Fifteen of the compromised sites have taken action to remove the malicious script injections. The activity is assessed to be ongoing since at least August 20, 2024.\nDetails of the campaign were\nfirst flagged\nby security firm Source Defense towards the end of February 2025, detailing the web skimmer's use of the \"\napi.stripe[.]com/v1/sources\n\" API, which allows applications to accept various payment methods. The endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the new PaymentMethods API as of May 15, 2024.\nThe attack chains employ malicious domains as the initial distribution point for the JavaScript skimmer that's designed to intercept and hide the legitimate payment form on order checkout pages, serve a replica of the legitimate Stripe payment screen, validate it using the sources API, and then transmit it to a remote server in Base64-encoded format.\nJscrambler said the threat actors behind the operation are likely leveraging vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in WooCommerce, WordPress, and PrestaShop to implant the initial stage script. This loader script serves to decipher and launch a Base64-encoded next-stage, which, in turn, contains the URL pointing to the skimmer.\n\"The skimming script hides the legitimate Stripe iframe and overlays it with a malicious one designed to mimic its appearance,\" the researchers said. \"It also clones the 'Place Order' button, hiding the real one.\"\nOnce the details are exfiltrated, users are displayed an error message, asking them to reload the pages. There is some evidence to suggest that the final skimmer payload is generated using some sort of tool owing to the fact that the script appears to be tailored to each targeted site.\nThe security company further noted that it uncovered skimmer scripts impersonating a Square payment form, suggesting that the threat actors are likely targeting several payment service providers. And that's not all. The skimming code has also been observed adding other payment options using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether (Ethereum), Tether, and Litecoin.\n\"This sophisticated web skimming campaign highlights the evolving tactics attackers use to remain undetected,\" the researchers said. \"And as a bonus, they effectively filter out invalid credit card data, ensuring that only valid credentials are stolen.\"\nFound this article interesting?

It has been codenamed Operation Stream.\nThe\nmulti-year\nprobe\n, which commenced in 2022 and involved 38 countries across the world, saw 1,393 identified globally through an analysis of payment transactions, with 79 of them arrested to date for distributing CSAM. Some of the apprehended individuals have also been accused of not only uploading and watching such content but also abused children.\nIn addition, more than 3,000 electronic devices have been seized. The investigation remains ongoing.\nAccording to Europol, Kidflix launched in 2021 and amassed a catalog of 91,000 unique videos over time. Roughly 3.5 new videos were uploaded to the platform every hour on average.\nThe platform, which had about 190,000 registered users since April 2022 and until its shutdown, offered the ability to both download and stream the content after users made payments using cryptocurrencies, which were then converted into tokens.\n\"By uploading CSAM, verifying video titles and descriptions and assigning categories to videos, offenders could earn tokens, which were then used to view content,\" Europol said.\n\"Each video was uploaded in multiple versions – low, medium and high quality – allowing criminals to preview the content and pay a fee to unlock higher quality versions.\"\nThat said, the identified offenders represent only a fraction of the 1.8 million users who are suspected to have logged on to the platform between April 2022 and March of this year.

        "Content": "A maximum severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability has been discovered impacting all versions of Apache Parquet up to and including 1.15.0.\nThe problem stems from the deserialization of untrusted data that could allow attackers with specially crafted Parquet files to gain control of target systems, exfiltrate or modify data, disrupt services, or introduce dangerous payloads such as ransomware.\nThe vulnerability is tracked under\nCVE-2025-30065\nand has a CVSS v4 score of 10.0. The flaw was fixed with the release of Apache version 1.15.1.\nIt should be noted that to exploit this flaw, threat actors must convince someone to import a specially crafted Parquet file.\nSevere threat to \"big data\" environments\nApache Parquet is an open-source, columnar storage format designed for efficient data processing. Unlike row-based formats (like CSV), Parquet stores data by columns, which makes it faster and more space-efficient for analytical workloads.\nIt is widely adopted across the data engineering and analytics ecosystem, including big data platforms like Hadoop, AWS, Amazon, Google, and Azure cloud services, data lakes, and ETL tools.\nSome large companies that use Parquet include Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, and LinkedIn.\nThe security problem in Parquet was disclosed on April 1, 2025, following a responsible disclosure by its finder, Amazon researcher Keyi Li.\n\"Schema parsing in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet 1.15.0 and previous versions allows bad actors to execute arbitrary code,\" warned the short\nbulletin published on Openwall\n.\n\"Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.15.1, which fixes the issue.\"\nA separate bulletin by Endor Labs highlights the risk of CVE-2025-30065 exploitation more clearly, warning that the flaw can impact any data pipelines and analytics systems that import Parquet files, with the risk being significant for files sourced from external points.\nEndor Labs believes the problem was introduced in Parquet version 1.8.0, though older releases might also be impacted. The firm suggests coordinated checks with developers and vendors to determine what Praquet versions are used in production software stacks.\n\"If an attacker tricks a vulnerable system into reading a specially crafted Parquet file, they could gain remote code execution (RCE) on that system,\"\nwarns Endor Labs\n.\nHowever, the security firm avoids over-inflating the risk by including the note, \"Despite the frightening potential, it's important to note that the vulnerability can only be exploited if a malicious Parquet file is imported.\"\nThat being said, if upgrading to Apache Parquet 1.15.1 immediately is impossible, it is suggested to avoid untrusted Parquet files or carefully validate their safety before processing them. Also, monitoring and logging on systems that handle Parquet processing should be increased.\nAlthough no active exploitation has been discovered yet, the risk is high due to the flaw's severity and the widespread use of Parquet files in big data applications.\nAdministrators of impacted systems are recommended to upgrade to Parquet version 1.15.1, which addresses CVE-2025-30065, as soon as possible.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nCritical RCE flaw in Apache Tomcat actively exploited in attacks\nWordPress security plugin WP Ghost vulnerable to remote code execution bug\nCritical PHP RCE vulnerability mass exploited in new attacks\nIvanti fixes three critical flaws in Connect Secure & Policy Secure\nOver 12,000 KerioControl firewalls exposed to exploited RCE flaw"

        "Content": "Oracle has finally acknowledged to some customers that attackers have stolen old client credentials after breaching a \"legacy environment\" last used in 2017, Bloomberg reported.\nHowever, while Oracle told clients this is old legacy data that is not sensitive, the threat actor behind the attack has shared data with BleepingComputer from the end of 2024 and posted newer records from 2025 on a hacking forum.\nAccording to Bloomberg\n, the company also informed clients that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and the FBI are investigating the incident.\nCybersecurity firm\nCybelAngel\nfirst revealed that Oracle told clients that an attacker who gained access to the company's Gen 1 (also known as Oracle Cloud Classic) servers as early as January 2025 used a 2020 Java exploit to deploy a web shell and additional malware.\nDuring the breach, detected in late February, the attacker allegedly exfiltrated data from the Oracle Identity Manager (IDM) database, including user emails, hashed passwords, and usernames.\nThis comes after a threat actor (known as rose87168)\nput up for sale 6 million data records\non BreachForums on March 20 and released multiple text files containing a sample database, LDAP information, and a list of the companies as proof that the data was legitimate, all of them allegedly stolen from Oracle Cloud's federated SSO login servers.\nThreat actor selling data allegedly stolen from Oracle Cloud (BleepingComputer)\n​When asked to confirm the authenticity of the leaked data, Oracle told BleepingComputer that \"There has been no breach of Oracle Cloud. The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data.\"\nOracle denied this even after an\narchived URL\nshowed that the threat actor uploaded a file containing their email address to one of Oracle's servers. This URL was subsequently removed from Archive.org, but an\narchive of the archive\nstill exists.\nHowever, days later,\nBleepingComputer confirmed\nwith multiple companies that additional samples of the leaked data (including associated LDAP display names, email addresses, given names, and other identifying information) received from the threat actor were valid.\nOracle has consistently denied reports of a breach in Oracle Cloud in statements shared with the press since the incident surfaced. This is admittedly true since it aligns with the reports that Oracle is telling customers that the breach impacted an older platform known as Oracle Cloud Classic.\n\"Oracle rebadged old Oracle Cloud services to be Oracle Classic. Oracle Classic has the security incident,\" cybersecurity expert\nKevin Beaumont\nconfirmed on Monday. \"Oracle are denying it on 'Oracle Cloud' by using this scope — but it’s still Oracle cloud services that Oracle manage. That’s part of the wordplay.\"\nAn Oracle spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today for more details on the Oracle Cloud breach.\nBreach at Oracle Health\nLast week, Oracle also notified customers of a\nbreach at the software-as-a-service (SaaS) company Oracle Health\n(formerly Cerner), impacting multiple U.S. healthcare organizations and hospitals.\nEven though the company has not publicly disclosed this incident, BleepingComputer confirmed that patient data was stolen in the attack, as confirmed by private communications between Oracle Health and impacted customers and from conversations with those involved.\nOracle Health said it detected the breach of legacy Cerner data migration servers on February 20, 2025, and that the attackers used compromised customer credentials to hack into the servers sometime after January 22, 2025.\nSources told BleepingComputer that the impacted hospitals are now being extorted by a threat actor named \"Andrew,\" who has not claimed affiliation with extortion or ransomware groups.\nThe threat actor is demanding millions of dollars in cryptocurrency not to leak or sell the stolen data and has created clearnet websites about the breach to pressure the hospitals into paying the ransom.\nBleepingComputer has contacted Oracle Health multiple times about this incident since March 4, but we have not received a reply.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nOracle denies breach after hacker claims theft of 6 million data records\nOracle Health breach compromises patient data at US hospitals\nOracle customers confirm data stolen in alleged cloud breach is valid\nTexas State Bar warns of data breach after INC ransomware claims attack\nRoyal Mail investigates data leak claims, no impact on operations"

        "Content": "A cascading supply chain attack on GitHub that targeted Coinbase in March has now been traced back to a single token stolen from a SpotBugs workflow, which allowed a threat actor to compromise multiple GitHub projects.\nThe popular static analysis tool SpotBugs was breached in November 2024, leading to the compromise of Reviewdog, which subsequently led to the infection of tj-actions/changed-files.\nThe multi-step supply chain attack eventually exposed secrets in 218 repositories, while the latest findings showed that the threat actors were initially attempting to breach projects belonging to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.\nThe start of the attack, which has remained unknown so far, was discovered by Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 researchers who\nadded an update\nyesterday on their original analysis of the incident.\nThe cascading supply chain attack\nWe now know that the supply chain attack started in late November 2024 when a SpotBugs maintainer (SPTBHS_MNTNR) added their Personal Access Token (PAT) into a CI workflow.\nOn December 6, 2024, an attacker exploited a vulnerable 'pull_request_target' workflow to steal the maintainer's PAT via a malicious pull request from a throwaway user account (randolzflow).\nOn March 11, 2025, the attacker used the stolen PAT to invite another dummy user (jurkaofavak) into SpotBugs, who pushed a malicious GitHub Actions workflow that exfiltrated another PAT belonging to a Reviewdog maintainer (RD_MNTNR) who also had access to SpotBugs.\nThe stolen PAT had write access to '\nreviewdog/action-setup\n,' allowing the attacker to override the v1 tag with a malicious commit from a fork, poisoning all consumers of v1.\nThis created a backdoor that was executed when used by '\ntj-actions/eslint-changed-files\n,' which the project relied on.\nUsing stolen credentials, the attacker overrode git tags in the repository to point to a malicious commit that would dump secrets from CI runners into logs, potentially impacting 23,000 repositories using that action. However, it was later determined that the malicious tj-actions commit only\nexposed secrets for 218 repositories\n.\nAs revealed during post-incident investigations, the attacker tailored the malicious commit to target 'coinbase/agentkit.' Coinbase's CI pulled and executed the tainted version on March 14, 2025.\nSupply chain attack diagram\nSource: Unit 42\nDespite this, no Coinbase secrets were exposed, so the attacker's attempt to access the exchange's infrastructure failed. The company was quickly tipped about the attempted breach and removed the workflow.\nNow that the complete picture of the incident has been painted, it becomes clear that the breach was highly organized and meticulously planned, starting months earlier than initially known.\nAlso, the incident highlights fundamental problems in the chain of trust between open-source repositories, as well as GitHub Action ecosystem issues like tag mutability and poor audit logging.\nProjects and repositories that used the compromised actions should rotate all secrets immediately.\nGitHub Actions logs, especially those from March 10-14, 2025, should be audited for signs of secrets being printed, especially base64-encoded blobs.\nTo mitigate the risk of similar attacks in the future, it is recommended to pin dependencies using commit hashes instead of tags, and avoid 'pull_request_target' unless necessary.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nGitHub Action supply chain attack exposed secrets in 218 repos\nGitHub Action hack likely led to another in cascading supply chain attack\nSupply chain attack on popular GitHub Action exposes CI/CD secrets\nInfostealer campaign compromises 10 npm packages, targets devs\nNew npm attack poisons local packages with backdoors"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nThe notorious cybercrime group Hunters International is dropping ransomware to focus on data theft and extortion.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nHunters International, a notorious ransomware group that recently claimed an attack on Indian engineering firm Tata Technologies, is rebranding itself and moving to exfiltration-only tactics, threat intelligence firm Group-IB reports.\nActive since late 2023, Hunters is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group that adapted many of the tools and techniques associated with Hive, the ransomware gang disrupted by law enforcement in January 2023.\n\n\n\nAccording to Group-IB, evidence suggests that Hunters is a rebrand of Hive: affiliates and operators of other ransomware groups refer to the RaaS as Hive and some of the individuals involved with the operation were contacted by Hunters’ administrators from the same accounts as Hive.\n\n\n\nOn its Tor-based leak site, the group has listed roughly 300 victim organizations, nearly half of which are in North America. Hunters also hit more than 50 organizations in Europe and two dozen in Asia. The real estate, healthcare, professional services, financial services, government, and energy sectors were targeted the most.\n\n\n\nHunters’ affiliate panel allows cybercriminals to register a victim, customize the malware, and chat with the victim. The panel also provides a tool called Storage Software, which collects metadata on the files stolen from the victim and sends it to Hunters’ servers.\n\n\n\nAffiliates can set the ransom amount from the panel, and are provided with the file-encrypting malware, which is compatible with x64, x86, and ARM architectures and can run on Windows and Linux. If a victim pays, the affiliate receives 80% of the proceeds.\n\n\n\nAccording to Group-IB, the Storage Software tool can also be used to download and delete files, as long as it runs on the same host with the files, which suggests that the stolen data is initially hosted by the affiliate. Victims that pay the ransom are likely provided with access to download and delete the data.\n\n\n\nThe latest version of the ransomware, Group-IB notes, no longer drops a ransom note, nor renames the encrypted files by appending a specific extension.Advertisement.

According to Group-IB, most extortion groups will likely adopt the same tactic in the future.\n\n\n\nBased on internal notes posted by the RaaS operators, the cybersecurity firm believes that the group plans to move away from file-encrypting ransomware, as it is risky and no longer profitable.\n\n\n\n“As a result, the operators released a new project on 1 January 2025 called World Leaks.

Hunters also hit more than 50 organizations in Europe and two dozen in Asia. The real estate, healthcare, professional services, financial services, government, and energy sectors were targeted the most.\n\n\n\nHunters’ affiliate panel allows cybercriminals to register a victim, customize the malware, and chat with the victim. The panel also provides a tool called Storage Software, which collects metadata on the files stolen from the victim and sends it to Hunters’ servers.\n\n\n\nAffiliates can set the ransom amount from the panel, and are provided with the file-encrypting malware, which is compatible with x64, x86, and ARM architectures and can run on Windows and Linux. If a victim pays, the affiliate receives 80% of the proceeds.\n\n\n\nAccording to Group-IB, the Storage Software tool can also be used to download and delete files, as long as it runs on the same host with the files, which suggests that the stolen data is initially hosted by the affiliate. Victims that pay the ransom are likely provided with access to download and delete the data.\n\n\n\nThe latest version of the ransomware, Group-IB notes, no longer drops a ransom note, nor renames the encrypted files by appending a specific extension.Advertisement.

Secret Protection is free for public repositories.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the platform has made its standalone security products available as add-ons for GitHub Team organizations, meaning smaller development teams no longer need to upgrade to GitHub Enterprise to use them.\n\n\n\nTo further help organizations identify and neutralize code secrets before they are leaked, GitHub also allows organizations across GitHub Team and Enterprise plans to run a secret risk assessment across all their public, private, and internal repositories.\n\n\n\n“The point-in-time scan provides clear insights into the exposure of your secrets across your organization, along with actionable steps to strengthen your security and protect your code. In order to lower barriers for organizations to use and benefit from the feature, no specific secrets are stored or shared,” GitHub notes.\n\n\n\nThe capability has been released in public preview and the code-hosting platform is requesting feedback on how it could improve it.Advertisement.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nTwo CVEs now exist for an actively exploited CrushFTP vulnerability and much of the security industry is using the ‘wrong one’.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nMore details have emerged on the story of the CVE controversy around a CrushFTP vulnerability that threat actors started exploiting just days after its existence came to light.\nOn March 21, the developers of the CrushFTP enterprise file transfer solution informed customers that versions 10 and 11 are affected by a critical vulnerability that exposes systems to remote hacking. An attacker can leverage the flaw to bypass authentication and gain admin access to impacted CrushFTP instances.\n\n\n\nPatches were included in versions 11.3.1 and 10.8.4 and workarounds were also made available, but since no CVE was announced for the vulnerability five days after its existence was disclosed, vulnerability intelligence firm VulnCheck decided to assign it a CVE, specifically CVE-2025-2825.\n\n\n\nVulnCheck has been a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) since April 2023 and it is allowed to assign CVE identifiers to vulnerabilities found in software that is not specifically covered by other CNAs. \n\n\n\nHowever, CrushFTP was not happy with the decision, arguing that the “real CVE” had been pending. Indeed, roughly 10 days after disclosure, CrushFTP told SecurityWeek that the CVE for this vulnerability is CVE-2025-31161, which was assigned by Outpost24, the security firm credited for responsibly disclosing the flaw to the vendor. \n\n\n\nIn a blog post published on Wednesday, Outpost24 clarified that it reached out to MITRE for a CVE on March 13 and the plan was to keep details of the vulnerability under wraps for 90 days to avoid malicious exploitation. \n\n\n\nIt took MITRE until March 27 to assign CVE-2025-31161, according to Outpost24. By the time CVE-2025-31161 was announced — the first public mention of this CVE appears to be in SecurityWeek’s April 2 article — much of the security industry had already started using CVE-2025-2825 (assigned by VulnCheck) to track the vulnerability. \n\n\n\n“[VulnCheck] had not contacted CrushFTP or Outpost24 beforehand to see if a responsible disclosure process was already underway. Nor did they credit Outpost24 for discovery,” Outpost24 said.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nOutpost24 is now waiting for a response from MITRE regarding the CVE conflict. At the time of writing, CVE-2025-2825 is listed in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), but CVE-2025-31161 is not. \n\n\n\nThe story of the vulnerability started attracting more attention after VulnChech assigned a CVE and several security firms started analyzing it, releasing technical details and PoC exploit code. \n\n\n\nSoon after, the non-profit cybersecurity organization The Shadowserver Foundation started seeing exploitation attempts. Data from Shadowserver shows that the attacks are ongoing, although the number of IPs launching attacks started to drop on April 2.  \n\n\n\nInitially there were roughly 1,800 vulnerable internet-exposed CrushFTP instances. The number of vulnerable instances has steadily dropped, according to data from Shadowserver. However, as of April 2 there are still hundreds of vulnerable instances worldwide, including over 500 in the US.\n\n\n\nCrushFTP told SecurityWeek on Tuesday that it had been pushing customers to patch their installations, and the company blamed security firms — which it described as “bad actors” — for the vulnerability being exploited so quickly in the wild. \n\n\n\nIt’s still unclear what attackers have been doing after exploiting the vulnerability. The flaw could allow threat actors to gain access to sensitive data or conduct further attacks against the targeted organization. \n\n\n\nRelated: NIST Still Struggling to Clear Vulnerability Submissions Backlog in NVD\nRelated: CVE and NVD – A Weak and Fractured Source of Vulnerability Truth\nRelated: Google Cloud to Assign CVEs to Critical Vulnerabilities\nRelated: CVE Turns 25\n\nOn March 21, the developers of the CrushFTP enterprise file transfer solution informed customers that versions 10 and 11 are affected by a critical vulnerability that exposes systems to remote hacking.

Devices running firmware versions 16.2 and 17 should be upgraded to a patched release, but earlier firmware releases are not affected.\n\n\n\nThe second DoS flaw resolved on Wednesday, tracked as CVE-2025-20139, affects the chat messaging features of ECE and could be exploited remotely, without authentication.\n\n\n\nImproper validation of user-supplied input, the tech giant explains, could allow an attacker to send malicious requests to a chat entry point and cause the application to stop responding.\n\n\n\n“The application may not recover on its own and may need an administrator to manually restart services to recover,” the company notes.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nWhile default ECE configurations are not affected by this flaw, instances that have the chat feature enabled and an entry point configured are vulnerable, Cisco says.\n\n\n\nFixes for the bug were included in Cisco ECE version 12.6 ES 10. Users of earlier releases are advised to migrate to a patched version.\n\n\n\nCisco also released patches for two medium-severity vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) and Prime Infrastructure that could lead to remote, unauthenticated cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Both issues are the result of improperly validated user-supplied input.\n\n\n\nThe tech giant says it is not aware of any of these vulnerabilities being exploited in attacks, but users are advised to apply the available patches as soon as possible. Additional information can be found on Cisco’s security advisories page.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the company updated its advisory for two critical security defects in Smart Licensing Utility that could allow attackers to log in with administrative privileges and obtain log files, respectively, to warn of their in-the-wild exploitation.\n\n\n\nTracked as CVE-2024-20439 and CVE-2024-20440, the flaws were patched in September 2024, and threat actors started exploiting them in attacks in March 2025.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cisco Patches 10 Vulnerabilities in IOS XR\nRelated: Cisco Patches Vulnerabilities in Nexus Switches\nRelated: Salt Typhoon Targeting Old Cisco Vulnerabilities in Fresh Telecom Hacks\nRelated: Cisco Patches Critical Vulnerabilities in Enterprise Security Product\n\nThe Meraki bug, tracked as CVE-2025-20212, was discovered in the AnyConnect VPN server, and was the result of a variable not being initialized when establishing an SSL VPN session.\n\n\n\nAn attacker with valid VPN user credentials could supply crafted attributes when the SSL VPN session was established, to cause the AnyConnect VPN server to restart, forcing remote users to initiate new VPN connections.\n\n\n\n“A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established,” Cisco explains, adding that the server would automatically recover when the attack stops.\n\n\n\nMeraki MX firmware releases 18.107.12, 18.211.4, and 19.1.4 address the security defect.

The initial report showed that a null terminator could be used in the attack, but further investigation after the patch revealed that different invalid UTF8 continuation bytes could be used as well.\n\n\n\nMore importantly, SafeBreach discovered that the patch for the unauthorized file write – which involved Quick Share to delete the ‘unknown file’ used in the exploit when the transfer session was over – did not resolve the issue.\n\n\n\n“This was the critical vulnerability we initially discovered that allowed us to bypass the need for a file-transfer acceptance from the Quick Share user and instead send a file directly to their device without approval,” SafeBreach says.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nGoogle resolved the flaw by having Quick Share delete the ‘unknown file’, but did not consider the possibility that two files with the same ‘payload ID’ would be transferred during the same session. Because of that, the application would delete only the first file to be sent.\n\n\n\n“We ran the exact same exploit that we ran for the original vulnerability, but instead sent two PayloadTransfer packets of type FILE. We set different file names and contents for the two packets, but set the payload IDs to be the same,” SafeBreach says.\n\n\n\nThe bypass, tracked as CVE-2024-10668, was resolved in November 2024. Quick Share for Windows version 1.0.2002.2 contains patches for all vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nRelated: VMware Patches Authentication Bypass Flaw in Windows Tools Suite\nRelated: SonicWall Patches Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Firewalls\nRelated: Microsoft MFA Bypassed via AuthQuake Attack\nRelated: Glove Stealer Malware Bypasses Chrome’s App-Bound Encryption\n\nQuick Share was initially developed for Android only, but was later released on Windows and Chrome as well, allowing users to share files with compatible devices nearby over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and other protocols.\n\n\n\nIn August last year, Safebreach shared details on 10 flaws in Quick Share for Windows that could allow attackers to write files to a target device without a user’s approval, cause crashes, redirect traffic, and perform other malicious actions.\n\n\n\nCollectively tracked as CVE-2024-38271 (CVSS score of 5.9) and CVE-2024-38272 (CVSS score of 7.1), the issues were quickly patched by Google to prevent man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks that could eventually lead to RCE.\n\n\n\nNow, SafeBreach says that the fixes were incomplete, and that the application was still prone to denial-of-service (DoS) and remote unauthorized arbitrary file write attacks.\n\n\n\nQuick Share, the security firm says, could be crashed when sending a file containing invalid UTF8 continuation bytes in its name.
