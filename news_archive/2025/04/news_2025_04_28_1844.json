        "Content": "What happens when cybercriminals no longer need deep skills to breach your defenses? Today's attackers are armed with powerful tools that do the heavy lifting ‚Äî from AI-powered phishing kits to large botnets ready to strike. And they're not just after big corporations. Anyone can be a target when fake identities, hijacked infrastructure, and insider tricks are used to slip past security unnoticed.\nThis week's threats are a reminder: waiting to react is no longer an option. Every delay gives attackers more ground.\n‚ö° Threat of the Week\nCritical SAP NetWeaver Flaw Exploited as 0-Day\n‚Äî A critical security flaw in SAP NetWeaver (CVE-2025-31324, CVSS score: 10.0) has been\nexploited\nby unknown threat actors to upload JSP web shells with the goal of facilitating unauthorized file uploads and code execution. The attacks have also been observed using the Brute Ratel C4 post-exploitation framework, as well as a well-known technique called Heaven's Gate to bypass endpoint protections.\nFirewalls are Obsolete in the AI Era. It's Time for a Modern Security Approach\nCompanies need to rethink how they protect their private and public use of AI and how they defend against AI-powered attacks. Traditional firewalls, VPNs, and public-facing IPs expose your attack surface and are no match in the AI era. It's time for a modern approach with Zscaler Zero Trust + AI.\nSee \"Zero Trust + AI\" in Action ‚ûù\nüîî Top News\nDarcula Phishing Kit Gets GenAI Upgrade\n‚Äî The threat actors behind the Darcula phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform have released new updates to their cybercrime suite with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) capabilities to facilitate phishing form generation in various languages, form field customization, and translation of phishing forms into local languages. The updates further lower the technical barrier for creating phishing pages, making it quick and easy for even a novice criminal to set up complex smishing scams. The Darcula PhaaS suite is user-friendly. All that an aspiring scammer needs to do is sign up for the Darcula service, enter a legitimate brand site, and the platform will generate a bespoke, spoofed phishing version. \"Darcula is not just a phishing platform; it's a service model designed for scale,\" Netcraft\nsaid\n. \"Users pay for access to a suite of tools that enable impersonation of organizations in nearly every country. Built using modern technologies like JavaScript frameworks, Docker, and Harbor, the infrastructure mirrors that of legitimate SaaS companies.\"\nContagious Interview Sets Up Fake Firms\n‚Äî North Korea-linked threat actors behind the Contagious Interview have\nset up front companies\nnamed BlockNovas LLC, Angeloper Agency, and SoftGlide LLC as a way to distribute malware during the fake hiring process. The activity exemplifies the sophisticated social engineering tactics employed by North Korean threat actors to lure developers. The disclosure comes as Pyongyang hackers are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence as part of the fraudulent IT worker scheme. At the heart of these operations lies a comprehensive suite of AI-enhanced tools that work in concert and are used to create synthetic personas in order to sustain the deception. The facilitators utilize unified messaging services that provide a way to manage multiple personas across various communication channels simultaneously. These services also incorporate AI-powered translation, transcription, and summarization capabilities to help the IT workers communicate with their prospective employers.\nSuspected Russian Hackers Use New Tactic to Access Microsoft 365 Accounts\n‚Äî Multiple suspected Russia-linked threat actors like UTA0352 and UTA0355 are \"aggressively\" targeting individuals and organizations with ties to Ukraine and human rights with an aim to gain unauthorized access to Microsoft 365 accounts since early March 2025. \"These recently observed attacks rely heavily on one-on-one interaction with a target, as the threat actor must both convince them to click a link and send back a Microsoft-generated code,\" Volexity\nsaid\n. \"These recent campaigns benefit from all user interactions taking place on Microsoft's official infrastructure; there is no attacker-hosted infrastructure used in these attacks.\"\nThreat Actors Exploit Google Infrastructure for Phishing Attack\n‚Äî Unknown threat actors have\nleveraged\na novel approach that allowed bogus emails to be sent via Google's infrastructure and redirect message recipients to fraudulent sites that harvest their credentials. The sophisticated phishing attack bypassed email authentication checks, and sought to trick email recipients into clicking on bogus links that are designed to harvest their Google Account credentials. Google has since plugged the attack pathway.\nLotus Panda Targets Southeast Asia With Sagerunex\n‚Äî The China-linked cyber espionage group tracked as\nLotus Panda\nhas been attributed to a campaign that compromised multiple organizations in an unnamed Southeast Asian country between August 2024 and February 2025. The activity has been found to employ DLL side-loading techniques to drop a backdoor named Sagerunex, as well as two credential stealers ChromeKatz and CredentialKatz that are equipped to siphon passwords and cookies stored in the Google Chrome web browser. In recent months, a cyber espionage campaign known as\nOperation Cobalt Whisper\nhas targeted multiple industries in Hong Kong and Pakistan, including defense, education, environmental engineering, electrotechnical engineering, energy, cybersecurity, aviation and healthcare, with phasing emails that serve as a conduit to deliver Cobalt Strike. The Pakistan Navy has also been\ntargeted\nby a likely nation-state adversary to distribute a stealthy infostealer called\nSync-Scheduler\nto the targeted victims. While the tactics exhibited in the campaign overlap with those of SideWinder and Bitter APT, there is no ample evidence to link it to a specific threat actor. And that's not all. Chinese cybersecurity researchers have been\ntargeted\nby a Vietnamese threat group known as\nAPT32\nbetween mid-September and early October 2024 to deploy Cobalt Strike via trojanized GitHub projects.\n‚ÄéÔ∏è‚Äçüî• Trending CVEs\nAttackers love software vulnerabilities‚Äîthey're easy doors into your systems. Every week brings fresh flaws, and waiting too long to patch can turn a minor oversight into a major breach. Below are this week's critical vulnerabilities you need to know about. Take a look, update your software promptly, and keep attackers locked out.\nThis week's list includes ‚Äî\nCVE-2024-58136, CVE-2025-32432\n(Craft CMS),\nCVE-2025-31324\n(SAP NetWeaver),\nCVE-2025-27610\n(Rack),\nCVE-2025-34028\n(Commvault Command Center),\nCVE-2025-2567\n(Lantronix Xport),\nCVE-2025-33028\n(WinZip),\nCVE-2025-21204\n(Microsoft Windows),\nCVE-2025-1021\n(Synology DiskStation Manager),\nCVE-2025-0618\n(FireEye EDR Agent),\nCVE-2025-1763\n(GitLab),\nCVE-2025-32818\n(SonicWall SonicOS),\nCVE-2025-3248\n(Langflow),\nCVE-2025-21605\n(Redis),\nCVE-2025-23249, CVE-2025-23250, and CVE-2025-23251\n(NVIDIA NeMo Framework),\nCVE-2025-22228\n(Spring Framework, NetApp), and\nCVE-2025-3935\n(ScreenConnect).\nüì∞ Around the Cyber World\nLumma Stealer Adopts New Tricks to Evade Detection\n‚Äî The information stealer known as Lumma, which has been advertised as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) starting at $250 a month, is being distributed extensively using\nvarious methods\nsuch as pirated media, adult content, and cracked software sites, as well as fake Telegram channels for such content to redirect users to fraudulent CAPTCHA verifications that leverage the ClickFix tactic to trick users into downloading and running the malware via PowerShell and MSHTA commands. The stealer, for its part, uses techniques like DLL side-loading and injecting the payload into the overlay section of free software to trigger a complex infection process. \"The overlay section is typically used for legitimate software functionality, such as displaying graphical interfaces or handling certain input events,\" Kaspersky said. \"By modifying this section of the software, the adversary can inject the malicious payload without disrupting the normal operation of the application. This method is particularly insidious because the software continues to appear legitimate while the malicious code silently executes in the background.\" Lumma Stealer has\nremained\nan active threat since its debut in 2022, continually receiving updates to evade detection through\nfeatures\nlike code flow obfuscation, dynamic resolution of API functions during runtime, Heaven's gate, and disabling ETWTi callbacks. It's also designed to detect virtual and sandbox environments. As of August 2023, Lumma Stealer team began\ntesting\nan AI-based feature to determine if an infected user log is a bot or not. The widespread adoption of Lumma Stealer is also evidenced by the use of diverse infection vectors, which have leveraged the stealer to\ndeliver\nadditional payloads like\nAmadey\n. \"The operators of LummaStealer run an internal marketplace on Telegram [...] where thousands of logs are bought and sold daily,\" Cybereason\nsaid\n. \"They also include features like a rating system to encourage quality sellers, advanced search options for both passwords and cookies, and a wide price range. Coupled with 24/7 support, the marketplace aims to provide a seamless experience for anyone trading stolen data, reflecting a trend seen across various Telegram and darknet-based stealer communities.\" According to\ndata\nfrom IBM X-Force, there has been an 84% weekly average increase in infostealers delivered via phishing emails last year, compared to 2023.\nNew SessionShark AiTM Phishing Kit Advertised\n‚Äî A new adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing kit called SessionShark O365 2FA/MFA is being showcased as a way for threat actors to bypass Microsoft 365 multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections. Ostensibly marketed for educational purposes to avoid liability, the service claims to be equipped with a range of anti-detection and stealth capabilities to avoid detection by bots and automated security scanners using CAPTCHA checks, integrate with Cloudflare's services, and access comprehensive logs via a dedicated panel. \"This duplicitous marketing strategy is common in underground forums ‚Äì it provides a thin veneer of deniability (to avoid forum bans or legal issues) but fools no one about the true purpose,\" SlashNext\nsaid\n. \"Phrases like 'for educational purposes' or 'ethical hacking perspective' in the ad copy are a wink and nod to buyers that this is a hacking tool, not a classroom demo.\"\nElusive Comet Abuses Zoom Remote Control Feature for Crypto Theft\n‚Äî Security researchers are calling attention to a campaign called\nElusive Comet\nthat employs sophisticated social engineering tactics with the goal of tricking victims into installing malware and ultimately stealing their cryptocurrency. Ostensibly operating a venture capital firm named Aureon Capital, the threat actor is estimated to be responsible for millions of dollars in stolen funds. \"Elusive Comet maintains a strong online presence with extensive history in order to establish and maintain legitimacy,\" Security Alliance said. \"This is accomplished by setting up polished websites and active social media profiles, as well as creating profiles which impersonate real people with notable credentials.\" Attacks commence with an outreach phase wherein potential victims are approached over Twitter DMs or email, inviting them to be a guest on their podcast or for an interview. The invitations are sent through Calendly links to schedule a Zoom meeting. Once the invite is accepted, victims are urged to join the Zoom call and share their screen to present their work, at which point the threat actors use the videoconferencing software to request control over the potential victim's computer by changing their display name to \"Zoom\" and make it appear as a system notification. Granting remote access allows Elusive Comet to install malware such as GOOPDATE for facilitating cryptocurrency theft, as\nhighlighted\nby Jake Gallen, the chief executive of non-fungible token platform Emblem Vault who had over $100,000 of his personal assets stolen. The attacks have also been observed delivering information stealers and remote access trojans to enable data exfiltration. \"What makes this attack particularly dangerous is the permission dialog's similarity to other harmless Zoom notifications,\" Trail of Bits\nsaid\n. \"The Elusive Comet campaign succeeds through a sophisticated blend of social proof, time pressure, and interface manipulation that exploits normal business workflows.\" It's not clear who is behind the campaign, but evidence points to it being North Korea, which has been observed scheduling fake Zoom calls with targets under the pretext of meeting with venture capitalists or discussing a partnership opportunity, and deceiving them into installing malware to\naddress non-existent audio issues\n.\nPower Parasites Goes After Bangladesh, Nepal, India\n‚Äî An active campaign is targeting individuals across Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Nepal, and India, with job and investment scams via combination of deceptive websites masquerading as energy firms and other major firms, social media groups, Youtube videos, and Telegram channels since September 2024. The activity cluster, which is designed to trick victims into parting with their banking details or personal financial information, has been codenamed Power Parasites. \"These campaigns are typically shared with potential victims on social media networks, over email, or via direct messaging channels,\" Silent Push\nsaid\n.\nSeveral Extensions Found with Risky Features\n‚Äî Fifty-eight suspicious Google Chrome extensions have been\ndiscovered\ncontaining risky features, such as monitoring browsing behavior, accessing cookies for domains, altering search providers, and potentially executing remote scripts,\naccording\nto Secure Annex researcher John Tuckner. The most interesting aspect of these extensions is that they are hidden, meaning they don't show up on Chrome Web Store searches, but they can be accessed should users have the direct URL. This indicates that threat actors are using unconventional ways to evade detection while aggressively pushing them through ads and malicious sites. The extensions have been cumulatively installed on roughly 5.98 million devices. A Google spokesperson told The Hacker News that \"we're aware of the report and investigating.\"\nMitre releases ATT&CK v17\n‚Äî Mitre has\nreleased\na new version of its ATT&CK framework, the compendium of adversary tactics and techniques it puts together to help defenders. The latest version introduces four new techniques targeting the VMware ESXi platform, while adapting 34 existing ones. Two notable changes include the renaming of Network platform to Network Devices to better reflect techniques used to target network devices such as routers, switches, and load balancers, and the merging of two sub-techniques DLL Side-Loading and DLL Search Order Hijacking into one category called \"\nHijack Execution Flow: DLL\n\" by taking into account their overlapping nature. Also added to ATT&CK v17 is a technique named \"Remote Access Tools: Remote Access Hardware\" that highlights Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)\nremote work schemes\n.\nCISA Discontinues Use of Censys and VirusTotal\n‚Äî Hundreds of staff in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have been\nnotified\nthat the agency discontinued the use of Censys late last month and Google-owned VirusTotal on April 20, 2025. \"We understand the importance of these tools in our operations and are actively exploring alternative tools to ensure minimal disruption,\" Nextgov quoted an email sent to CISA staffers. \"We are confident that we will find suitable alternatives soon.\" The development days after the cybersecurity industry was sent into a tailspin after an internal memo from MITRE\nrevealed\nthat the U.S. would no longer support its flagship CVE Program. However, at the eleventh hour, CISA\nreversed course\nand extended the contract by about 11 months. \"To set the record straight, there was no funding issue, but rather a contract administration issue that was resolved prior to a contract lapse,\" Matt Hartman, CISA Acting Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity,\nsaid\n. \"There has been no interruption to the CVE program and CISA is fully committed to sustaining and improving this critical cyber infrastructure.\nHow Windows PC Manager Could Be Hijacked\n‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have outlined two scenarios where releases associated with the PC Manager tool, a software designed to help optimize and manage Windows computers, could have been hijacked by attackers via\nWinGet\nrepository (\nZDI-23-1527\n), 'aka.ms' URLs, and the official \"pcmanager.microsoft[.]com\" subdomain of Microsoft (\nZDI-23-1528\n), due to overly permissive Shared Access Signature (\nSAS\n) tokens. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on customers' endpoints without requiring any authentication. \"If an attack had been carried out, cybercriminals could have compromised software supply chains for distribution of malware, allowed them to replace software releases, and alter distributed PC Manager executables,\" Trend Micro\nsaid\n. The issues, both of which carry a CVSS score of 10.0, have since been addressed by Microsoft in October 2023.\nNew Magecart Campaigns Observed in the Wild\n‚Äî A new credit card skimming (aka Magecart) campaign has been\nobserved\ninjecting malicious code into compromised e-commerce sites with the goal of intercepting payment data entered by users in checkout forms. The attacks involve gaining access to the sites' backend systems using credentials stolen through an information stealer, leveraging it to upload a malicious PHP page directly to the server. The PHP script acts as a web shell to gain remote control of the site and pollute the database by inserting a malicious JavaScript code. The JavaScript is designed to capture payment information, checking the validity of the numbers entered, and exfiltrate the information via a WebSocket connection and as an image. Credit card data stolen via web skimmers are typically sold on\ncarding forums\nlike Savastan0, where they are purchased by other threat actors to further criminal activity in exchange for a cryptocurrency payment. \"Savastan0's rules establish that a buyer only has 10 minutes to use a checker, otherwise the card cannot be refunded,\" Yarix\nsaid\n. \"Every check costs $0.30. Without making any transaction, card checker services may be used to 'soft check' the authenticity of cards. This lowers the possibility of alerting the legitimate owner to the activity or warning anti-fraud systems. It may also be used to infer expiration dates and CVV codes, among other missing information.\" The disclosure comes as Jscrambler detailed a stealthy web skimming campaign that infiltrated 17 Caritas Spain websites running WooCommerce using a modular kit designed to stay undetected while intercepting sensitive payment data. \"The skimming campaign, like many, was executed in two stages,\" Jscrambler\nsaid\n. \"Stage one served as the loader, laying the groundwork for the attack. Stage two held the skimmer logic itself, injected a fake payment form, and exfiltrated sensitive data.\" The exact initial infection vector remains unknown, although there is evidence pointing to the fact that the threat actors have persistent access to the WooCommerce installation. Jscrambler said the stolen card details are validated within 10 minutes of exfiltration, indicating some level of automation.\n4Chan Makes a Return\n‚Äî Infamous imageboard site 4chan has come partly back online after a\nhack\ntook the site down for nearly two weeks. In a post on its blog, it\nsaid\n\"a hacker using a U.K. IP address exploited an out-of-date software package on one of 4chan's servers, via a bogus PDF upload. With this entry point, they were eventually able to gain access to one of 4chan's servers, including database access and access to our own administrative dashboard. The hacker spent several hours exfiltrating database tables and much of 4chan's source code.\" 4chan said the breached server has been replaced and that PDF uploads have been temporarily disabled on boards that supported the feature.\nSK Telecom Discloses Breach\n‚Äî SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile operator, has\nalerted\ncustomers that a malware infection allowed threat actors to access their sensitive USIM-related information. The company said it became aware of the incident on April 19, 2025, around 11 p.m. local time. SK Telecom, however, emphasized that there is no evidence the information has been misused in any manner. The attack has not been claimed by any known threat actor or group.\nNew Flaws in Kentico Xperience CMS\n‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a now-patched vulnerability in the Kentico Xperience content management system (CMS) application (\nCVE-2025-2748\n, CVSS score: 6.5) that results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by taking advantage of the fact it does not fully validate or filter files uploaded via the multiple-file upload functionality. The bug essentially allows an attacker to distribute a malicious payload as an unauthenticated user when uploading multiple files to the application. This issue affects Kentico Xperience through 13.0.178. Also addressed by Kentico are\nthree other vulnerabilities\n, WT-2025-0006 (authentication bypass), WT-2025-0007 (Post-authentication Remote Code Execution), and WT-2025-0011 (Authentication Bypass), that can achieve Remote Code Execution against fully-patched deployments.\nIndian Banks Ordered to Migrate to \".bank[.]in\" Domains by October 31\n‚Äî In Febraury 2025, India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),\nintroduced\nan exclusive \".bank[.]in\" internet domain for banks in the country to combat digital financial fraud. In a new directive\nissued\nlast week, the RBI has urged banks to commence the migration to the new domain and complete the process by October 31, 2025. To that end, banks are required to contact the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) to initiate the registration process.\nNew DDoS Botnet Powered by 1.33 Million Devices\n‚Äî The largest ever DDoS botnet consisting of 1.33 million devices has been observed targeting the \"Betting shops\" microsegment and lasted approximately 2.5 hours in late March 2025. Over 50% of the compromised devices are located in Brazil, followed by Argentina, Russia, Iraq, and Mexico, per\nQrator Labs\n. The disclosure coincided with an emerging threat campaign targeting poorly managed MS-SQL servers to deploy Ammyy Admin and PetitPotato malware for remote access and privilege escalation. \"The attackers exploit vulnerable servers, execute commands to gather system information and use WGet to install the malware,\" Broadcom\nsaid\n. \"They also enable RDP services and add new user accounts to maintain persistent access.\"\nScallywag Uses Bogus WordPress Extensions For Ad Fraud\n‚Äî A collection of four WordPress plugins ‚Äì Soralink, Yu Idea, WPSafeLink, and Droplink ‚Äì collectively dubbed\nScallywag\nis being advertised as a fraud-as-a-service operation to help monetize digital piracy and URL-shortening services. \"These modules redirect users through one or more intermediary pages to request and render ads before delivering the promised content or shortened URL,\" the HUMAN Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team said. At its peak, Scallywag accounted for 1.4 billion fraudulent bid requests a day across 407 cash out domains. The attack process begins with a user visiting a movie piracy catalog site. Once the content to be viewed is chosen, they are redirect a Scallywag-associated cashout blog loaded with ads before leading to their final destination, where the content is hosted. HUMAN said new cash out sites have emerged amid continued crackdown on the scheme, underscoring what appears to be a game of whack-a-mole with the fraudsters.\nMicrosoft Officially Begins Recall Rollout\n‚Äî Microsoft has made available its artificial intelligence (AI) powered\nRecall\nfeature on Copilot+ PC, nearly a year after it was announced to immense privacy and security backlash. The concerns led the company to make it an opt-in feature and rearchitect the system with improved controls to prevent unauthorized access. \"We've implemented extensive security considerations, such as Windows Hello sign-in, data encryption and isolation in Recall to help keep your data safe and secure,\" Microsoft\nsaid\n. \"Recall data is processed locally on your device, meaning it is not sent to the cloud and is not shared with Microsoft and Microsoft will not share your data with third-parties.\" Security researcher Kevin Beaumont\nsaid\nMicrosoft has made \"serious efforts\" to address some of the substantive security complaints, but noted that filtering sensitive data from snapshots can be hit-or-miss.\nCybercrime Costs Victims $16 billion in 2024\n‚Äî The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center, or IC3, recorded 859,532 complaints in 2024, of which 256,256 complaints led to a staggering loss of $16.6 billion, a 33% increase in losses from 2023. \"Fraud represented the bulk of reported losses in 2024, and ransomware was again the most pervasive threat to critical infrastructure, with complaints rising 9% from 2023,\" IC3\nsaid\n. \"As a group, those over the age of 60 suffered the most losses and submitted the most complaints.\" Investment, business email compromise (BEC), tech support scams took the top three slots for the most loss. Hong Kong, Vietnam, Mexico, the Philippines, India, and China were the main international destinations for fraudulent wire transactions. Ransomware attack reports to the FBI totalled 3,156 in 2024, up from 2,825 in 2023 and 2,385 in 2022. As many as 67 new ransomware variants were recognized in 2024.\nJapan Warns of Unauthorized Stock Trading via Stolen Credentials\n‚Äî Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is\nalerting\nusers of unauthorized transactions on internet stock trading services using stolen credentials harvested from phishing websites impersonating their legitimate counterparts. There have been 1,454 fraudulent transactions to date. These\nunauthorized trading transactions\nare worth almost ¬•100 billion ($700 million) since February.\nFBI Seeks Info on Salt Typhoon\n‚Äî The FBI said it's seeking information about a Chinese hacking group called\nSalt Typhoon\nand its\ncompromise\nof U.S. telecom companies. \"Investigation into these actors and their activity revealed a broad and significant cyber campaign to leverage access into these networks to target victims on a global scale,\" the agency\nsaid\n. \"This activity resulted in the theft of call data logs, a limited number of private communications involving identified victims, and the copying of select information subject to court-ordered US law enforcement requests.\"\nPrivacy Watchdog Files GDPR Complaint Against Ubisoft\n‚Äî Austrian privacy non-profit noyb has accused French video game developer and publisher Ubisoft of violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws in the region by forces its customers to connect to the internet every time they launch a single player game even in scenarios where they don't have any online features. \"This allows Ubisoft to collect people's gaming behaviour. Among other things, the company collects data about when you start a game, for how long you play it and when you close it,\" noyb\nsaid\n. \"Even after the complainant explicitly asked why he is forced to be online, Ubisoft failed to disclose why this is going on.\" The complaint comes close on the heels of noyb calling out the complex \"cooperation mechanism\" to handle complaints between the Data Protection Authority (DPA) in the users' Member State and the DPA in the company's Member State. \"This regulation could have been a game changer for exercising people's fundamental rights. Instead, it looks like it will waste thousands of hours in already overworked authorities by prescribing various useless and overly complex procedural steps, which translates to millions in taxpayer money,\" Max Schrems\nsaid\n. \"At the same time, procedures will be slower and also more complex for business and citizens alike. Enforcement of GDPR rights of normal people will be even harder to reach.\"\nFlaw in SSL.com DCV Process\n‚Äî A flaw in SSL.com's domain control validation (DCV) process could have\nallowed\nattackers to bypass verification and issue fraudulent SSL certificates for any domain linked to certain email providers such as aliyun[.]com. A total of 11 certificates are said to have been issued in this manner.\nAsian Scam Operations Expand Globally\n‚Äî The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has revealed that\nscam centers\nrun by East and Southeast Asian organized crime gangs have spread like a \"cancer\" in response to law enforcement efforts, resulting in a global expansion. Nigeria, Zambia, Angola, Brazil, and Peru are some of the new spillover sites where Asian-led groups have migrated to. \"The dispersal of these sophisticated criminal networks within areas of weakest governance has attracted new players, benefited from and fueled corruption, and enabled the illicit industry to continue to scale and consolidate, culminating in hundreds of industrial-scale scam centres generating just under US $40 billion in annual profits,\" the UNODC\nsaid\n.\nüé• Cybersecurity Webinars\nAI-Powered Impersonation Is Beating MFA‚ÄîHere's How to Shut the Door on Identity-Based Attacks\n‚Äî AI-driven impersonation is making traditional MFA useless‚Äîand attackers are getting in without ever stealing a password.

Just feed in your screenshots and let Eyeballer highlight what matters.\nüîí Tip of the Week\nDon't Let Video Calls Become Backdoors\n‚Äî Attackers are now using fake meeting invites to trick people into giving them remote access during video calls. They set up fake interviews or business meetings, then request screen control ‚Äî sometimes even changing their name to \"Zoom\" to make it look like a system message. If you click \"Allow\" without thinking, they can take over your computer, steal data, or install malware.\nTo stay safe, disable remote control features if you don't need them. On Zoom, turn it off in Settings under \"In Meeting (Basic).\" Always double-check who's asking for access, and never approve control just because it looks official. Use browser-based tools like Google Meet when possible ‚Äî they're safer because they can't easily take control of your system.\nFor extra protection, Mac users can block Zoom (or any app) from getting special permissions like \"Accessibility,\" which is needed for remote control. IT teams can also set this up across all company devices. And watch out for invites from odd emails or links ‚Äî real companies won't use personal accounts or fake booking pages. Stay alert, and don't let a simple click turn into a big problem.\nConclusion\nThe most effective defenses often start with asking better questions. Are your systems behaving in ways you truly understand? How might attackers use your trusted tools against you?\nNow is the time to explore security beyond technology ‚Äî look into how your team handles trust, communication, and unusual behavior. Map out where human judgment meets automation, and where attackers might find blind spots.\nCuriosity isn't just for research ‚Äî it's a powerful shield when used to challenge assumptions and uncover hidden risks.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Not every security vulnerability is high risk on its own - but in the hands of an advanced attacker, even small weaknesses can escalate into major breaches. These five real vulnerabilities, uncovered by\nIntruder's\nbug-hunting team, reveal how attackers turn overlooked flaws into serious security incidents.\n1. Stealing AWS Credentials with a Redirect\nServer-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a common vulnerability that can have a significant impact, especially in cloud-hosted applications. If a web application fetches resources from user-supplied URLs, care should be taken to ensure attackers can't manipulate requests to access unintended resources.\nWhile assessing a home-moving app running in AWS, our team tested common SSRF bypass techniques.\nThe attack chain was as follows: the app sent a webhook request to the attacker's web server, which responded with a 302 redirect to AWS's metadata service. The app followed the redirect and logged the response, which exposed sensitive metadata - including AWS credentials.\nWith these credentials, an attacker could enumerate IAM permissions and attempt to pivot deeper into the cloud environment.\nThis attack would not have been possible if the metadata service was\nenforcing IMDSv2\n- a best practice that a good\ncloud security scanner\nwould have flagged. While automated tools might not have detected the full attack chain, breaking just this part of the chain could have prevented exploitation.\n2. From Exposed .git Repo to Full Database Access\nWhile investigating an unintentionally exposed .git repository flagged by a vulnerability scan, our team discovered it belonged to a publicly accessible web application.\nReviewing the application's source code, we uncovered an authentication bypass - the login page could be accessed by supplying a hidden parameter.\nOur team gained access to a management tool, where further analysis revealed a blind SQL injection vulnerability in an authenticated page.\nExploiting this vulnerability granted access to a university's database, which, if leveraged by an attacker, could have exposed sensitive personal information of students and staff - showing how a small misconfiguration can quickly escalate into a major security risk.\n3. How a Tiny Detail Led to Remote Code Execution\nWhile hunting for bugs in a document signing app, our team noticed that, after signing a PDF, the metadata listed \"ExifTool\" as the document creator. Given ExifTool's history of critical vulnerabilities, we dug deeper.\nAlthough the application didn't disclose the tool's version, testing for recent known vulnerabilities confirmed it was vulnerable to\nCVE-2021-22204\n. By creating and uploading a malicious PDF, our team successfully gained remote command execution as the www-data user.\nThis foothold could have allowed an attacker to leverage additional vulnerabilities on the affected server, enabling them to gain root access and pivot to other machines on the network, causing extensive damage.\n4. From Self-XSS to Site-Wide Account Takeover\nCross-site scripting (XSS) is a powerful attack vector for session hijacking attacks, especially when no user interaction is required. While a 'Self-XSS' vulnerability is typically low risk, it can become dangerous when combined with another vulnerability.\nOur team uncovered this exact scenario while assessing an auction application. A Self-XSS vulnerability was discovered where a user-supplied HTTP request header was reflected in the application's response.\nNormally, this would be harmless since an attacker can't force a victim's browser to send a malicious header - but further testing uncovered a cache-poisoning vulnerability.\nBy chaining these two weaknesses, our team tricked the app into caching and serving the Self-XSS payload to all site visitors, escalating it to a site-wide persistent XSS attack.\nThis would have allowed an attacker to hijack any user account - including admin accounts.\n5. Changing a Number to Expose Sensitive Data\nAPI weaknesses are more common than you'd think. Among them, IDOR vulnerabilities require little effort to exploit beyond modifying an identifier in a request.\nThe real challenge for an attacker isn't execution but discovery - finding a vulnerable endpoint that can be used without proper authentication or authorization, and recognizing that it exposes sensitive data. Once found, exploitation can be as simple as changing the identifier to a resource that the user does not own, or just making a request to an endpoint that should be reserved for administrators.\nOur team frequently identifies IDOR, missing authentication, and broken authorization weaknesses in APIs. Here are some snippets from real HTTP requests and paths we found that exposed highly sensitive data:\nGET /organisations/edit_user?user_id=1001\n: The attacker could modify user profiles and hijack accounts\nGET /prod-applicantresumes/12031.pdf\n: The attacker could access job seekers' CVs.\nPOST /Order/Download, OrderNo=10202\n: The attacker could access customer order information.\nThese examples are about as simple as API weaknesses get, but the consequences are far-reaching. By simply changing one number and enumerating through thousands of values, entire databases of information belonging to other customers can be downloaded.\nStop breaches before they start\nThese real-world examples show how vulnerabilities can escalate into serious breaches when left unchecked. Attackers don't wait - they're always searching for new entry points. The first step to staying ahead? Knowing what attackers can access from the internet - including assets you might not even know exist. Intruder continuously discovers these unknowns, like subdomains, logins, and APIs, and scans them for exposures that other solutions miss.\nIntruder's Discovery tab - for those assets you did (or maybe didn't know) existed\nFrom applications to cloud infrastructure, find and secure it all in one, powerful platform with Intruder.\nLearn more\nor\nstart scanning with a 14 day free trial\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\nÔÇô\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Government and telecommunications sectors in Southeast Asia have become the target of a \"sophisticated\" campaign undertaken by a new advanced persistent threat (APT) group called\nEarth Kurma\nsince June 2024.\nThe attacks, per Trend Micro, have leveraged custom malware, rootkits, and cloud storage services for data exfiltration. The Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia are among the prominent targets.\n\"This campaign poses a high business risk due to targeted espionage, credential theft, persistent foothold established through kernel-level rootkits, and data exfiltration via trusted cloud platforms,\" security researchers Nick Dai and Sunny Lu\nsaid\nin an analysis published last week.\nThe threat actor's activities date back to November 2020, with the intrusions primarily relying on services like Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive to siphon sensitive data using tools like TESDAT and SIMPOBOXSPY.\nTwo other noteworthy malware families in its arsenal include rootkits such as KRNRAT and\nMoriya\n, the latter of which has been observed previously in attacks aimed at high-profile organizations in Asia and Africa as part of an espionage campaign dubbed TunnelSnake.\nTrend Micro also said that SIMPOBOXSPY and the exfiltration script used in the attacks share overlaps with another APT group codenamed\nToddyCat\n. However, a definitive attribution remains inconclusive.\nIt's currently not known as to how the threat actors gain initial access to target environments. The initial foothold is then abused to scan and conduct lateral movement using a variety of tools like NBTSCAN, Ladon, FRPC, WMIHACKER, and ICMPinger. Also deployed is a keylogger referred to as KMLOG to harvest credentials.\nIt's worth noting that the use of the open-source\nLadon\nframework has been previously\nattributed\nto a China-linked hacking group called TA428 (aka Vicious Panda).\nPersistence on the hosts is accomplished by three different loader strains referred to as DUNLOADER, TESDAT, and DMLOADER, which are capable of loading next-stage payloads into memory and executing them. These consist of Cobalt Strike Beacons, rootkits like KRNRAT and Moriya, as well as data exfiltration malware.\nWhat distinguishes these attacks is the use of living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques to install the rootkits, where hackers employ legitimate system tools and features, in this case, syssetup.dll, rather than introducing easily detectable malware.\nWhile Moriya is engineered to inspect incoming TCP packets for a malicious payload and inject shellcode into a newly spawned \"svchost.exe\" process, KRNRAT is an amalgamation of five different open-source projects with capabilities such as process manipulation, file hiding, shellcode execution, traffic concealment, and command-and-control (C2) communication.\nKRNRAT, like Moriya, is also designed to load a user-mode agent the rootkit and inject it into \"svchost.exe.\" The user-mode agent serves as a backdoor to retrieve a follow-on payload from the C2 server.\n\"Before exfiltrating the files, several commands executed by the loader TESDAT collected specific document files with the following extensions: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, and .pptx,\" the researchers said. \"The documents are first placed into a newly created folder named \"tmp,\" which is then archived using WinRAR with a specific password.\"\nOne of the bespoke tools used for data exfiltration is SIMPOBOXSPY, which can upload the RAR archive to Dropbox with a specific access token. According to a Kasperksy report from October 2023, the\ngeneric DropBox uploader\nis \"probably not exclusively used by ToddyCat.\"\nODRIZ, another program used for the same purpose, uploads the collected information to OneDrive by specifying the OneDrive refresh token as an input parameter.\n\"Earth Kurma remains highly active, continuing to target countries around Southeast Asia,\" Trend Micro said. \"They have the capability to adapt to victim environments and maintain a stealthy presence.\"\n\"They can also reuse the same code base from previously identified campaigns to customize their toolsets, sometimes even utilizing the victim's infrastructure to achieve their goals.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Ongoing outages at British retail giant Marks & Spencer are caused by a ransomware attack believed to be conducted by a hacking collective known as \"Scattered Spider\"¬†BleepingComputer has learned from multiple sources.\nMarks & Spencer (M&S) is a British multinational retailer that employs 64,000 employees and sells various products, including clothing, food, and home goods in over 1,400 stores worldwide.\nLast Tuesday, M&S\nconfirmed it suffered a cyberattack\nthat caused widespread disruption, including to its\ncontactless payment system and¬†online ordering\n. Today,\nSky News reported\nthat the disruption continues, with around 200 warehouse workers told to stay home as the company responds to the attack.\nBleepingComputer has now learned that the ongoing outages are caused by a ransomware attack that encrypted the company's servers.\nThe threat actors are believed to have first breached M&S as early as February, when they reportedly stole the Windows domain's NTDS.dit file.\nAn NTDS.dit file is the main database for Active Directory Services running on a Windows domain controller. This file contains the password hashes for Windows accounts, which can be extracted by threat actors and cracked offline to gain access to associated plain-text passwords.\nUsing these credentials, a threat actor can then laterally spread throughout the Windows domain, while stealing data from network devices and servers.\nSources told BleepingComputer that the threat actors ultimately deployed the DragonForce decryptor to VMware ESXi hosts on April 24th to encrypt virtual machines.\nBleepingComputer has learned that Marks and Spencer asked for help from CrowdStrike, Microsoft, and¬†Fenix24 to¬†investigate and respond to the attack.\nThe investigation so far indicates that the hacking collective known as\nScattered Spider\n, or as Microsoft calls them,\nOcto Tempest\n, is behind the attack.\nWhen contacted with this information, M&S said that they could not go into details about the cyber incident.\nDo you have information about this or another cyberattack? If you want to share the information, you can contact us securely and confidentially on Signal at LawrenceA.11, via email at lawrence.abrams@bleepingcomputer.com, or by using our\ntips form\n.\nWho is Scattered Spider?\nScattered Spider, also known as\n0ktapus\n,¬†Starfraud,\nUNC3944\n,\nScatter Swine\n,\nOcto Tempest\n, and\nMuddled Libra\n, is a group of threat actors that are adept at using social engineering attacks, phishing, multi-factor¬†authentication (MFA) bombing (targeted MFA fatigue), and SIM swapping to gain initial network access on large organizations.\nThe group includes young English-speaking members (as young as 16) with diverse skill sets who frequent the same hacker forums, Telegram channels, and Discord servers. These mediums are then used to plan and conduct attacks in real time.\nSome members are believed to be part of the \"Comm\" - a loose-knit community involved in violent acts and cyber incidents that have gained\nwide media attention\n.\nWhile the media and researchers commonly refer to Scattered Spider as a cohesive gang, they are actually a network of individuals, with different threat actors participating in each attack. This fluid structure is what makes it difficult to track them.\nThe group initially started in financial fraud and¬†social media hacks but later advanced to extremely sophisticated social engineering attacks to steal cryptocurrency from individuals or breach corporations in extortion attacks.\nThe group escalated its attacks in September 2023 when they\nbreached MGM Resorts\nutilizing a social engineering attack impersonating an employee when calling the company's IT help desk. In this attack, the threat actors deployed the BlackCat ransomware to\nencrypt more than¬†100 VMware ESXi hypervisors\n.\nThis was a pivotal moment in the ransomware landscape as it was the first known indication that English-speaking threat actors were working with Russian-speaking ransomware gangs.\nSince then, Scattered Spider has been known to act as affiliates for\nRansomHub\n,\nQilin\n, and now DragonForce.\nDragonForce is a ransomware operation that launched in December 2023, and has\nrecently begun promoting a new service\nwhere they allow cybercrime teams to white-label their services.\nResearchers commonly associate attacks with the Scattered Spider group based on\nspecific indicators of compromise\n, including credential-stealing phishing attacks targeting SSO platforms, social engineering attacks impersonating IT help desktop, and other tactics.\nCybersecurity firm Silent Push\nreleased a report\nearlier this month outlining Scattered Spider's most recent phishing attacks.\nOver the past two years, law enforcement has been increasingly targeting the group, arresting multiple alleged members in\nthe US\n, the\nUnited Kingdom\n, and\nSpain\n.\nRelated Articles:\nMarks & Spencer pauses online orders after cyberattack\nMarks & Spencer confirms a cyberattack as customers face delayed orders\nDragonForce expands ransomware model with white-label branding scheme"

        "Content": "Over 1,200 internet-exposed SAP NetWeaver instances are vulnerable to an actively exploited maximum severity unauthenticated file upload vulnerability that allows attackers to hijack servers.\nSAP NetWeaver is an application server and development platform that runs and connects SAP and non-SAP applications across different technologies.\nLast week, SAP disclosed an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability,¬†tracked as CVE-2025-31324, in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer, specifically the Metadata Uploader component.\nThe flaw allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary executable files on exposed instances without authenticating, achieving code execution and full system compromise.\nMultiple cybersecurity firms, including ReliaQuest, watchTowr, and Onapsis, confirmed the flaw is\nactively exploited in attacks\n, with threat actors utilizing it to¬†drop web shells on vulnerable servers.\nA SAP spokesperson told BleepingComputer that they were aware of these attempts and released a workaround on April 8, 2024, followed by a security update that addressed CVE-2025-31324 on April 25.\nSAP told BleepingComputer that they are not aware of any cases where these attacks impacted customer data or systems.\nWidely exploited in attacks\nResearchers have now confirmed that many vulnerable SAP Netweaver servers are exposed on the internet, making them prime targets for attacks.\nThe\nShadowserver Foundation\nfound the\n427 exposed servers\n,¬†warning¬†of the massive exposed attack surface and the potentially severe repercussions of exploitation.\nMost of the vulnerable systems (149) are in the United States, followed by India (50), Australia (37), China (31), Germany (30), the Netherlands (13), Brazil (10), and France (10).\nLocation of vulnerable SAP NetWeaver instances\nSource: The Shadowserver Foundation\nHowever, cyber defense search engine\nOnyphe\npaints a more dire picture, telling BleepingComputer that there are 1,284 vulnerable servers exposed online, with 474 already having been compromised with webshells.\n\"Something like 20 Fortune 500/Global 500 companies are vulnerable, and¬†many of them are compromised,\" Onyphe CTO Patrice¬†Auffret told BleepingComputer.\nResearchers reported that the threat actors are utilizing webshells with names like, \"cache.jsp\"¬†and \"helper.jsp.\" Howver,\nNextron Research says\nthey are also using random names, making it more difficult to find vulnerable Netweaver instances.\nWhile the number of servers is not massive, the risk is still significant, given that large enterprises and multinational corporations commonly use SAP NetWeaver.\nTo address the risk, it is recommended that the latest security update be applied by following the vendor's instructions in\nthis bulletin\n.\nIf unable to apply the update, the below mitigations are recommended:\nRestrict access to the /developmentserver/metadatauploader endpoint.\nIf Visual Composer is not in use, consider turning it off entirely.\nForward logs to SIEM and scan for unauthorized files in the servlet path.\nRedRays has also released a\nscanner tool for CVE-2025-31324\nthat can help pinpoint risks in large environments.\nBleepingComputer contacted SAP with further questions about the active exploitation and will update the story with any response.\nRelated Articles:\nSAP fixes suspected NetWeaver zero-day exploited in attacks\nActive!

        "Date": "2025-04-28",
        "Content": "‚ÄãOffensive Security warned Kali Linux users to manually install a new Kali repository signing key to avoid experiencing update failures.\nThe announcement comes after OffSec lost the old repo signing key (ED444FF07D8D0BF6) and was forced to create a new one (ED65462EC8D5E4C5) signed by Kali Linux developers¬†using signatures available on the\nUbuntu OpenPGP key server\n. However, since the key was not compromised, the old one was not removed from the keyring.\nWhen trying to get the list of latest software packages on systems still using the old key, users will see \"Missing key 827C8569F2518CC677FECA1AED65462EC8D5E4C5, which is needed to verify signature\" errors.\nWhile OffSec didn't share the date when it realized the key was lost, the company added that the Kali Linux repo was frozen on February 18th.\n\"In the coming day(s), pretty much every Kali system out there will fail to update. [..] This is not only you, this is for everyone, and this is entirely our fault. We lost access to the signing key of the repository, so we had to create a new one,\" the company\nsaid\n.\n\"At the same time, we froze the repository (you might have noticed that there was no update since Friday 18th), so nobody was impacted yet. But we're going to unfreeze the repository this week, and it's now signed with the new key.\"\nTo avoid experiencing these update issues, OffSec advises users to manually download and install the new repository signing key using the following command:\nsudo wget https://archive.kali.org/archive-keyring.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg\nOffSec also provides details on how to check that the checksum of the file matches and view the contents of the updated keyring. Those who don't trust manually updating the keyring can also reinstall Kali on their systems using images updated with the new keyring.\nThis isn't the first time Kali Linux users have had to manually update their keyring to avoid having update issues. In February 2018, Kali devs also\nlet the GPG key expire\nand asked users to update the new key manually.\n\"If you don't update Kali regularly (*cough*), then your archive-keyring package is outdated, and you'll get key mismatches when working with our repositories. Sucks for you, but at least you can manually update,\" the Kali team said at the time.\nRelated Articles:\nKali Linux 2025.1a released with 1 new tool, annual theme refresh\nMicrosoft: Windows 'inetpub' folder created by security fix, don‚Äôt delete\nLinux 'io_uring' security blindspot allows stealthy rootkit attacks\nSonicWall SMA VPN devices targeted in attacks since January\nCISA warns of increased breach risks following Oracle Cloud leak"
