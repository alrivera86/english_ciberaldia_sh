This also introduces a security risk in that improper validation of these plugin IDs can lead to potential vulnerabilities.\nThe discovery by Cymulate is a path traversal flaw arising as a result of improper validation of plugin IDs, which could allow attackers to manipulate the filesystem and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The issue is rooted in a function named \"ValidatePluginId\" within pluginutil.go.\n\"This function fails to properly sanitize input, allowing attackers to supply malicious plugin IDs containing path traversal sequences (e.g., ../),\" security researcher Elad Beber said.\nAs a result of this flaw, an attacker could essentially furnish a specially crafted plugin ID when creating an SSM document (e.g., ../../../../../../malicious_directory) to execute arbitrary commands or scripts on the underlying file system, paving the way for privilege escalation and other post-exploitation actions.\nFollowing responsible disclosure on February 12, 2025, the vulnerability was addressed on March 5, 2025, with the release of Amazon SSM Agent\nversion 3.3.1957.0\n.\n\"Add and use BuildSafePath method to prevent path traversal in the orchestration directory,\" according to release notes shared by the project maintainers on GitHub.\nFound this article interesting?

However, clicking on the link redirects the user to a completely different page hosted on \"taplink[.]cc\" that prominently displays another Download button.\nShould victims click on the download button, they are served a 7 MB ZIP archive (\"vinstaller.zip\"), which, when opened, contains a second password-protected archive (\"installer.zip\") and a text file with the password to open the file.\nPresent within the new ZIP file is an MSI installer that's responsible for creating several files, a console archive utility called \"UnRAR.exe,\" a RAR archive, and a Visual Basic (VB) script.\n\"The VB script runs a PowerShell interpreter to download and execute a batch file, confvk, from GitHub,\" Kaspersky said. \"This file contains the password for the RAR archive. It also unpacks malicious files and runs the next-stage script.\"\nThe batch file is also designed to run two PowerShell scripts, one of which sends system metadata using the Telegram API. The other file downloads another batch script that then acts on the contents of the RAR archive, ultimately launching the miner and\nclipper malware\n(aka ClipBanker) payloads.\nAlso dropped is the netcat executable (\"ShellExperienceHost.exe\") that establishes an encrypted connection with a remote server. That's not all. The confvk batch file has been found to create another file named \"ErrorHandler.cmd\" that contains a PowerShell script programmed to retrieve and execute a text string through the Telegram API.\nThe fact that the website has a Russian interface indicates a focus on Russian-speaking users.

        "Content": "Security Operations Centers (SOCs) today face unprecedented alert volumes and increasingly sophisticated threats. Triaging and investigating these alerts are costly, cumbersome, and increases analyst fatigue, burnout, and attrition. While artificial intelligence has emerged as a go-to solution, the term \"AI\" often blurs crucial distinctions. Not all AI is built equal, especially in the SOC. Many existing solutions are assistant-based, requiring constant human input, while a new wave of autonomous, Agentic AI has the potential to fundamentally transform security operations.\nThis article examines Agentic AI (sometimes also known as\nAgentic Security\n), contrasts it with traditional assistant-based AI (commonly known as Copilots), and explains its operational and economic impacts on modern SOCs. We'll also explore practical considerations for security leaders evaluating Agentic AI solutions.\nAgentic AI vs. Assistant AI (aka Copilots): Clarifying the Difference\nAgentic AI is defined by autonomy. Unlike traditional AI tools—which function as powerful assistants—Agentic AI systems independently perceive, plan, investigate, and conclude. In the context of SOC operations, Agentic AI acts much like a skilled Tier-1 analyst, autonomously\ntriaging alerts using industry best practices\n, thoroughly investigating incidents, and providing actionable outcomes with minimal human oversight.\nAssistant AI solutions, by contrast, are essentially smart tools waiting for human guidance. A security copilot, for example, can suggest insights or answer analyst questions about an alert, but it won't proactively investigate without explicit instruction. Every decision, action, or conclusion must first pass through a human analyst.\nConsider a scenario involving potential malware:\nAssistant AI\nwaits for the analyst's prompt, then responds to specific queries, leaving investigation decisions to the human.\nAgentic AI\n, conversely, proactively initiates and completes a full investigation—analyzing logs, correlating events, and possibly containing threats, then delivers a detailed report ready for human review.\nThe crucial distinction here is initiative and autonomy. Agentic AI isn't just another SOC automation tool like SOARs, it's an autonomous member of your security team. Unlike traditional SOAR or Hyperautomation tools, it doesn't need playbooks or scripted workflows. It adapts in real time, triaging and investigating alerts without you having to map out every move.\nHow Agentic AI Transforms SecOps and Improves SOC Economics\nAlso known as\nAI SOC Analysts\n, Agentic AI transforms the core of security operations by automating triage and investigation which is often the most time-consuming, high-volume tasks in the SOC. It doesn't just accelerate existing workflows, it makes them scalable, consistent, and cost-effective.\nInstant triage at scale\nAgentic AI evaluates every alert as it arrives, around the clock. It triages based on real indicators of risk, not just severity labels, reducing dwell time and surfacing the right threats faster than any human team could.\nDeep, consistent investigations\nUnlike basic enrichment or playbook automation, Agentic AI conducts structured investigations that follow lines of questioning an experienced analyst would pursue. Every alert gets the same level of scrutiny, regardless of priority, removing the need to choose between speed and depth.\nFewer gaps, better prioritization\nTraditional SOCs often ignore low- and medium-priority alerts due to time constraints. Agentic AI closes those gaps by investigating everything and ranking results based on actual risk. The result is better prioritization and fewer missed threats.\nOperational consistency, even under pressure\nWith no fatigue or bandwidth limits, Agentic AI maintains quality during alert storms and high-pressure moments. It eliminates triage shortcuts and helps avoid costly oversights, regardless of volume.\nMore focus, less burnout\nBy offloading repetitive triage and initial investigations (specially around removing the flood of benign alerts from human analyst queue), Agentic AI frees analysts to focus on high-value work like complex investigations and threat hunting. This\nreduces burnout\nand improves team retention, a critical factor in a competitive market with persistent skills shortage.\nLower costs, higher capacity\nAgentic AI boosts alert coverage and investigative speed without adding pressure to already stretched teams. It helps organizations scale security operations and add capacity in the face of ongoing cybersecurity skills shortages.\nImproved outcomes, measurable ROI\nBy investigating every alert thoroughly and consistently, Agentic AI improves key metrics like dwell time and Mean Time to Investigate (MTTI). Faster detection and deeper investigations reduce risk exposure and mitigate the financial and reputational impact of breaches.\nA force multiplier for the SOC\nAgentic AI doesn't replace analysts, it amplifies them. It helps teams scale efficiently, operate more effectively, and achieve better outcomes with fewer resources. The result: stronger security and a healthier bottom line.\nKey Considerations for Evaluating Agentic AI for your SOC\nNot all agentic solutions are equal. Security leaders must assess solutions based on:\nTransparency and Explainability:\nEnsure the solution clearly documents how decisions are made, enabling analysts and auditors to validate results confidently.\nAccuracy and Investigative Depth:\nHigh accuracy and thorough, multi-dimensional investigations across all relevant data sources are essential.\nSeamless Integration:\nThe solution should easily connect to your existing tools and fit within established workflows, minimizing disruption.\nCustomization and Adaptability:\nSeek AI solutions capable of learning and adapting to your unique security context.\nImpact and ROI\n: Measure the impact of the AI using the key SOC metrics that matter to your business. Ultimately, you want an Agentic AI tool for your SOC that improves business performance (i.e., lowers risk, lowers costs) and the metrics you track should be aligned with that.\nHow Prophet Security Redefines Alert Triage: Autonomous but Human-Driven\nThe introduction of Agentic AI represents a fundamental evolution for SOC teams, not a replacement of human analysts, but an augmentation enabling them to perform at their best. As organizations evaluate this transformative technology, choosing a transparent, accurate, and adaptive solution ensures that the SOC remains effective, efficient, and human-centric.\nBy handling routine investigations autonomously, Agentic AI empowers human analysts to focus on higher-value tasks, transforming the SOC from reactive to proactive and precise. Embracing this evolution today positions security teams to remain resilient against tomorrow's advanced threats.\nProphet Security\nexemplifies this evolution by automating alert triage and investigations with exceptional speed and accuracy. Powered by AI Agents, Prophet AI eliminates repetitive manual tasks, reduces analyst burnout, and significantly improves security outcomes.

        "Content": "The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has\nrevealed\na new set of cyber attacks targeting Ukrainian institutions with information-stealing malware.\nThe activity is aimed at military formations, law enforcement agencies, and local self-government bodies, particularly those located near Ukraine's eastern border, the agency said.\nThe attacks involve distributing phishing emails containing a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XLSM), which, when opened, facilities the deployment of two pieces of malware, a PowerShell script taken from the\nPSSW100AVB\n(\"Powershell Scripts With 100% AV Bypass\") GitHub repository that opens a reverse shell, and a previously undocumented stealer dubbed GIFTEDCROOK.\n\"File names and email subject lines reference relevant and sensitive issues such as demining, administrative fines, UAV production, and compensation for destroyed property,\" CERT-UA said.\n\"These spreadsheets contain malicious code which, upon opening the document and enabling macros, automatically transforms into malware and executes without the user's knowledge.\"\nWritten in C/C++, GIFTEDCROOK facilitates the theft of sensitive data from web browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox, such as cookies, browsing history, and authentication data.\nThe email messages are sent from compromised accounts, often via the web interface of email clients, to lend the messages a veneer of legitimacy, and trick prospective victims into opening the documents. CERT-UA has attributed the activity to a threat cluster UAC-0226, although it has not been linked to a specific country.\nThe development comes as a suspected Russia-nexus espionage actor dubbed UNC5837 has been linked to a phishing campaign targeting European government and military organizations in October 2024.\n\"The campaign employed signed .RDP file attachments to establish Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections from victims' machines,\" the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\nsaid\n.\n\"Unlike typical RDP attacks focused on interactive sessions, this campaign creatively leveraged resource redirection (mapping victim file systems to the attacker servers) and RemoteApps (presenting attacker-controlled applications to victims).\"\nIt's worth noting that the RDP campaign was\npreviously\ndocumented\nby CERT-UA, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft in October 2024 and subsequently by Trend Micro in December. CERT-UA is tracking the activity under the name UAC-0215, while the others have attributed it to the Russian state-sponsored hacking group APT29.\nThe attack is also notable for the likely use of an open-source tool called PyRDP to automate malicious activities such as file exfiltration and clipboard capture, including potentially sensitive data like passwords.\n\"The campaign likely enabled attackers to read victim drives, steal files, capture clipboard data (including passwords), and obtain victim environment variables,\" the GTIG said in a Monday report. \"UNC5837's primary objective appears to be espionage and file stealing.\"\nIn recent months, phishing campaigns have also been observed using\nfake CAPTCHAs\nand\nCloudflare Turnstile\nto distribute\nLegion Loader\n(aka Satacom), which then serves as a conduit to drop a malicious Chromium-based browser extension named \"Save to Google Drive.\"\n\"The initial payload is spread via a drive-by download infection that starts when a victim searches for a specific document and is lured to a malicious website,\" Netskope Threat Labs\nsaid\n. \"The downloaded document contains a CAPTCHA that, once clicked by the victim, will redirect it to a Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA and then eventually to a notification page.\"\nThe page prompts users to allow notifications on the site, after which the victims are redirected to a second Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA that, upon completion, is redirected again to a page that provides\nClickFix-style instructions\nto download the document they are looking for.\nIn reality, the attack paves the way for the delivery and execution of an MSI installer file that's responsible for launching Legion Loader, which, in turn, performs a series of steps to download and run interim PowerShell scripts, ultimately adding the rogue browser extension to the browser.\nThe PowerShell script also terminates the browser session for the extension to be enabled, turns on developer mode in the settings, and relaunches the browser. The end goal is to capture a wide range of sensitive information and exfiltrate it to the attackers.\nFound this article interesting?

It bears noting that the same vulnerability was previously tracked as\nCVE-2025-2825\n, which has now been marked Rejected in the CVE list.\nThe development comes after the disclosure process associated with the flaw has been entangled in controversy and confusion, with VulnCheck – due to it being a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) – assigned an identifier (i.e., CVE-2025-2825), while the actual CVE (i.e., CVE-2025-31161) had been pending.\nOutpost24, which is credited with responsibly disclosing the flaw to the vendor, has\nstepped in\nto clarify that it requested a CVE number from MITRE on March 13, 2025, and that it was coordinating with CrushFTP to ensure that the fixes were rolled out within a 90-day disclosure period.\nHowever, it wasn't until March 27 that MITRE assigned the flaw the CVE CVE-2025-31161, by which time VulnCheck had released a CVE of its own without contacting \"CrushFTP or Outpost24 beforehand to see if a responsible disclosure process was already underway.\"\nVulnCheck, for its part, has criticized MITRE for rejecting CVE-2024-2825 and publishing CVE-2025-31161 instead, while also accusing CrushFTP of attempting to cover up the vulnerability.\n\"CrushFTP, LLC released an advisory but deliberately requested that a CVE not be issued for 90-days, effectively trying to hide the vulnerability from the security community and defenders,\" VulnCheck security researcher Patrick Garrity\nsaid\nin a post on LinkedIn.\n\"What's worse is that MITRE appears to have prioritized their involvement in the write-up over the timely disclosure of a vulnerability that was actively being exploited in the wild. This sets a dangerous precedent.\"\nThe Swedish cybersecurity company has since released step-by-step instructions to trigger the exploit without sharing much of the technical specifics -\nGenerate a random alphanumeric session token of a minimum 31 characters of length\nSet a cookie called CrushAuth to the value generated in step 1\nSet a cookie called currentAuth to the last 4 characters of the value generated in step 1\nPerform an HTTP GET request to the target /WebInterface/function/ with the cookies from steps 2 and 3, as well as an Authorization header set to \"AWS4-HMAC=<username>/,\" where <username> is the user to be signed in as (e.g., crushadmin)\nA net result of these actions is that the session generated at the start gets authenticated as the chosen user, allowing an attacker to execute any commands that user has rights to.\nHuntress, which re-created a proof-of-concept for CVE-2025-31161,\nsaid\nit observed in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 on April 3, 2025, and that it uncovered further post-exploitation activity involving the use of MeshCentral agent and other malware. There is some evidence to suggest that the compromise may have happened as early as March 30.\nThe cybersecurity firm said it has seen exploitation efforts targeting four distinct hosts from four different companies to date, adding three of those affected were hosted by the same managed service provider (MSP). The names of the impacted companies were not disclosed, but they belong to marketing, retail, and semiconductor sectors.\nThe threat actors have been found to weaponize the access to install legitimate remote desktop software such as AnyDesk and MeshAgent, while also taking steps to harvest credentials in at least one instance.\nAfter deploying MeshAgent, the attackers are said to have added a non-admin user (\"CrushUser\") to the local administrators group and delivered another C++ binary (\"d3d11.dll\"), an implementation of the open-source library\nTgBot\n.\n\"Tt is likely that the threat actors are making use of a Telegram bot to collect telemetry from infected hosts,\" Huntress researchers said.\nAs of April 6, 2025, there are\n815 unpatched instances\nvulnerable to the flaw, with 487 of them located in North America and 250 in Europe.

If any are clicked, the victim receives a ZIP containing a password-protected archive (installer.zip) and a text file with the password.\nThe malware-distributing site\nSource: BleepingComputer\nThe archive contains an MSI file (installer.msi) inflated to 700MB in size to evade AV scans. Running it drops 'UnRAR.exe' and '51654.rar,' and executes a Visual Basic script that fetches a batch script (confvk.bat) from GitHub.\nThe script performs checks to determine whether it runs on a simulated environment and what antivirus products are active, and then downloads another batch script (confvz.bat) and unpacks the RAR archive.\nThe confvz.bat script establishes persistence via Registry modifications and the addition of Windows services.\nThe RAR file contains an AutoIT interpreter (Input.exe), the Netcat reverse shell tool (ShellExperienceHost.exe), and two payloads (Icon.dll and Kape.dll).\nThe complete infection chain\nSource: Kaspersky\nThe DLL files are a cryptocurrency miner and a clipper. The former hijacks the machine's computational power to mine cryptocurrency for the attacker's account, and the latter monitors the clipboard for copied cryptocurrency addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled ones.\nThe attacker also receives the infected system's information via Telegram API calls and can use the same channel to introduce additional payloads to the compromised machine.\nThis campaign is another example of threat actors exploiting any legitimate platform to gain false legitimacy and bypass protections.\nUsers are recommended to only download software from trusted publishers who they can verify, prefer the official project channels (in this case\nGitHub\n), and scan all downloaded files with an up-to-date AV tool before execution.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMassJacker malware uses 778,000 wallets to steal cryptocurrency\nGitVenom attacks abuse hundreds of GitHub repos to steal crypto\nPoisonSeed phishing campaign behind emails with wallet seed phrases\nNorth Korean hackers adopt ClickFix attacks to target crypto firms\nNew Crocodilus malware steals Android users’ crypto wallet keys"

Because of this failure, devices are perceived as stale, disabled, or deleted, leading to user authentication issues,\"\nMicrosoft explained\nin a Windows release health dashboard update.\n\"Devices running Windows Home edition are unlikely to be affected by this issue, as Kerberos authentication is typically used in enterprise environments and is not common in personal or home settings.\"\nMicrosoft says the issue was fixed in April 2025 with Windows security updates for\nWindows 11 24H2\nand\nWindows Server 2025\n. However, it also added that it disabled Machine Accounts in Credential Guard, a feature dependent on Kerberos password rotation, until a permanent fix is found.\n\"We recommend you install the latest update for your device as it contains important improvements and issue resolutions, including this one,\" the company said.\nIn November 2022, Redmond released emergency out-of-band (OOB) updates to\nfix another known issue triggering Kerberos sign-in failures\nand various other authentication problems on enterprise Windows domain controllers.\nIt also\naddressed authentication failures\nrelated to Kerberos delegation scenarios on Windows Server in November 2021 and\nsimilar Kerberos auth problems\naffecting domain-connected devices running Windows 2000 and later one year earlier.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft fixes Remote Desktop issues caused by Windows updates\nWindows 11 24H2 blocked on PCs with code-obfuscation driver BSODs\nRecent Windows Server 2025 updates cause Remote Desktop freezes\nWindows 11 update breaks Veeam recovery, causes connection errors\nMicrosoft: Recent Windows updates cause Remote Desktop issues"

The OCC identified a limited number of affected email accounts that have since been disabled.\"\nWhile the OCC initially said the breach only affected a limited number of accounts, people familiar with the investigation told Bloomberg that the attackers had access to more email accounts than previously thought and to around 100 bank regulators' emails.\nMajor information security incident\nOn Tuesday, April 8, the banking regulator\nnotified the U.S. Congress\nof a \"major information security incident\" discovered on February 11. The regulator said the system administrative account compromised in the breach was disabled one day later, on February 12.\nThe OCC added that \"the unauthorized access to a number of its executives' and employees' emails included highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions used in its examinations and supervisory oversight processes.\"\nIn early January, the Treasury Department also disclosed that\nits network was breached\nusing a stolen Remote Support SaaS API key to compromise a BeyondTrust instance used by the agency.\nThat attack has since been\nlinked to a Chinese state-backed hacking group\ntracked as Silk Typhoon. The threat actors\nspecifically targeted the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\n, which administers trade and economic sanctions programs, and\nthe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)\n, which reviews foreign investments for national security risks.\nSilk Typhoon hackers also breached\nthe Treasury's Office of Financial Research systems\n, but the impact of this incident is still being assessed.\nUpdate April 08, 13:45 EDT\n: Added details on OCC's Tuesday press release.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nUS removes sanctions against Tornado Cash crypto mixer\nBelgium probes if Chinese hackers breached its intelligence service\nAustralian pension funds hit by wave of credential stuffing attacks\nMITRE says state hackers breached its network via Ivanti zero-days\nOracle privately confirms Cloud breach to customers"

Microsoft is attributing the exploitation activity to Storm-2460, which also used PipeMagic to deploy ransomware,” the company said.\n\n\n\nOver the last few years, there have been at least 26 documented vulnerabilities in the Windows CLFS subsystem used for data and event logging and Microsoft has responded with a major new security mitigation to block these attacks.\n\n\n\nThe company’s plans include the addition of Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC) to detect unauthorized modifications to CLFS log files and cover one of the most attractive attack surfaces for APTs and ransomware attacks.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThe monster Patch Tuesday rollout also includes fixes for a use-after-free memory corruption flaw in Windows Hyper-V that allows an authorized attacker to execute code over a network. The issue is rated critical and carries remote code execution risks.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft also documented a pair of critical remote code execution flaws haunting its Windows Remote Desktop Services and warned that unauthorized attackers can execute code over a network.\n\n\n\nThe Microsoft Excel spreadsheet product also received a major security makeover to cover at least three vulnerabilities that the company says introduced remote code execution risks.\n\n\n\nThe company also fixed critical issues with remote code execution paths in the Microsoft Office productivity suite. \n\n\n\nIn addition to Microsoft, Adobe also released a massive batch of security updates alongside warnings that critical-severity vulnerabilities can be exploited to remotely take control of computer systems.\n\n\n\nThe Adobe Patch Tuesday rollout covers a total of 54 documented bugs and addresses major code execution defects in enterprise-facing products like Adobe ColdFusion, Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Commerce.\n\n\n\nThe company called urgent attention to a fix for the ColdFusion web development platform, warning that at least 15 documented vulnerabilities put organizations at risk to arbitrary file system read, arbitrary code execution and security feature bypasses.\n\n\n\nRelated: Microsoft Patches Another Already-Exploited Windows Zero-Day\nRelated: Microsoft Ships Urgent Patch for Exploited Windows CLFS Zero-Day\nRelated: Microsoft Tackling Windows Logfile Flaws With New Mitigation\nRelated: Microsoft Patches Windows Zero-Day Exploited by Russian Hackers\n\nThe CLFS zero-day, tagged as CVE-2025-29824, allows a local attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges by exploiting a use-after-free bug, Redmond’s security response team warned.\n\n\n\nThe issue carries a CVSS severity score of 7.8/10 and requires only low-level privileges with no user interaction. \n\n\n\nMicrosoft credited its internal threat intelligence team with discovering the issue, suggesting it was being exploited by professional hacking teams. The software maker said a patch for Windows 10 is not yet available and will be shipped at a later date.\n\n\n\nIn separate documentation, Microsoft blamed a ransomware group for the attacks and said targets include organizations in the information technology (IT) and real estate sectors of the United States, the financial sector in Venezuela, a Spanish software company, and the retail sector in Saudi Arabia. \n\n\n\n“In addition to discovering the vulnerability, Microsoft also found that the exploit has been deployed by PipeMagic malware.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nWhile often relegated to a purely functional role, DNS offers unparalleled opportunities for preemptive defense against cyberattacks.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nAs the threat landscape grows more sophisticated, Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are continuously searching for innovative ways to safeguard their organizations. Yet one of the most potent tools in their arsenal remains underutilized – DNS (domain name systems).\nBut first, let’s first talk about the important role DNS plays in every network. Domains are the first thing users, devices, and workloads query to communicate with resources across the internet. DNS is the phone book of the Internet, resolving domains such as www.*anydomainname*.com to IP addresses that computers and servers can understand.\n\n\n\nWhile often relegated to a purely functional role, DNS offers unparalleled opportunities for preemptive defense against cyberattacks. When harnessed correctly, DNS is the first line of defense. It can stop attacks before they succeed, disrupt command-and-control (C2) communications and data exfiltration, and provide invaluable insights for security operations centers (SOCs) during incident response. DNS in fact can also extend to secure every part of your network, from endpoints to cloud workloads and IoT/OT.\n\n\n\nIn fact, in 2020, the NSA started a pilot on protective DNS (they used the term “secure DNS” at the time) and concluded that they were able to reduce the ability of 92% of malware attacks to successfully deploy malware on a given network.\n\n\n\nEvolution Of AI-Powered Cyber Threats\nThe majority of security solutions today are right of “Boom” — reacting only after an attack has happened. When an initial infection happens (patient zero), security teams analyze the malware, domain or exploit and generate a signature or indicator of compromise (IOC) based on the attack. This signature or IOC is distributed to endpoint detection tools, antivirus solutions or intrusion detection systems, and shows up in VirusTotal and OSINT (open source intelligence) tools. The rest of the industry can now block this attack, because of this first victim or infection.\n\n\n\nThe rise of AI in the hands of cybercriminals has dramatically reshaped the threat landscape. Threat actors now leverage AI to:\n\n\n\n\nGenerate polymorphic malware: AI-driven malware continuously evolves its code to evade signature-based detection, making traditional security tools ineffective against rapidly morphing threats.\nAutomate phishing campaigns: AI crafts highly personalized phishing emails and generates fake websites that mimic legitimate ones with alarming accuracy, increasing the success rate of attacks.\nScale malicious infrastructure: AI-powered tools allow cybercriminals to rapidly create new domains, IP addresses, and hosting services, making detection and takedown efforts far more challenging. Registered domain generation algorithms (RDGAs) are a programmatic mechanism that allows threat actors to create many domain names at once or over time and register them for use in their infrastructure.\n\nAs a result, every threat and malware variant may be unique and highly targeted, forcing security teams to combat hundreds of thousands—or even millions—of patient zeros. Existing solutions simply cannot keep up–it would be like playing a cybersecurity game of whack-a-mole. This shift necessitates a different approach to cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nDNS as a Preemptive Cybersecurity WeaponAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nDNS is the earliest point of detection and prevention for all cyber threats because it almost always starts with a DNS query to a malicious domain. Protective DNS, with its ability to monitor, analyze and preemptively block that first query, offers a powerful left of “Boom” approach to thwart cyberthreats.\n\n\n\nLet’s walk through a typical ransomware kill chain and how protective DNS can help:\n\n\n\n\nPhishing – An initial attack may start with phishing emails and malicious ads. Protective DNS can block access to these malicious domains that are linked to phishing, drive-by downloads, and exploit kits. By proactively blocking access to these domains, organizations can reduce the possibility of initial compromise, ensuring no endpoint becomes patient zero.\nC2 communications – While the initial compromise may have been stopped by blocking access to malicious domains (as described above), there may be malware that is already on the network. To receive encryption keys, additional payloads and attack instructions, malware reaches out to an external server known as a command and control (C2). Protective DNS disrupts C2 communications by blocking access to domains used for command and control.\nData exfiltration – Finally, during the last phase of the kill chain, threat actors often use DNS tunneling to exfiltrate sensitive data. By encoding data in DNS queries, attackers bypass traditional security measures. Protective DNS tools can analyze query patterns and detect anomalies, stopping data exfiltration attempts in their tracks.\n\nWith advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), protective DNS technology continues to evolve. CISOs and security leaders should look for solutions that combine protective DNS with DNS-centric threat intelligence and AI to uncover traffic distribution systems (TDS) used by threat actors, disrupting their infrastructure at scale rather than taking down one domain at a time. Innovative solutions can also identify zero-day DNS threats– where newly registered domains are activated within minutes of registration, and domain generation algorithms (DGA and registered DGA), where malware cycles through several pseudo-random domains.\n\n\n\nNext Step: Evaluating Protective DNS\nWe are in an era where AI-powered cyberthreats and asymmetric warfare give threat actors unprecedented speed, scale and adaptability. DNS, often treated as a mundane network function, is in fact an extremely powerful weapon that can proactively defend against phishing, malware, and data exfiltration. For CISOs, the value is clear: it’s time to elevate DNS from a background role to a frontline preemptive weapon against cyberattacks.  Conduct assessments to determine the best solutions and the best platform to deploy.\n\t\t\t\nBut first, let’s first talk about the important role DNS plays in every network.

By proactively blocking access to these domains, organizations can reduce the possibility of initial compromise, ensuring no endpoint becomes patient zero.\nC2 communications – While the initial compromise may have been stopped by blocking access to malicious domains (as described above), there may be malware that is already on the network. To receive encryption keys, additional payloads and attack instructions, malware reaches out to an external server known as a command and control (C2). Protective DNS disrupts C2 communications by blocking access to domains used for command and control.\nData exfiltration – Finally, during the last phase of the kill chain, threat actors often use DNS tunneling to exfiltrate sensitive data. By encoding data in DNS queries, attackers bypass traditional security measures. Protective DNS tools can analyze query patterns and detect anomalies, stopping data exfiltration attempts in their tracks.\n\nWith advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), protective DNS technology continues to evolve. CISOs and security leaders should look for solutions that combine protective DNS with DNS-centric threat intelligence and AI to uncover traffic distribution systems (TDS) used by threat actors, disrupting their infrastructure at scale rather than taking down one domain at a time. Innovative solutions can also identify zero-day DNS threats– where newly registered domains are activated within minutes of registration, and domain generation algorithms (DGA and registered DGA), where malware cycles through several pseudo-random domains.\n\n\n\nNext Step: Evaluating Protective DNS\nWe are in an era where AI-powered cyberthreats and asymmetric warfare give threat actors unprecedented speed, scale and adaptability. DNS, often treated as a mundane network function, is in fact an extremely powerful weapon that can proactively defend against phishing, malware, and data exfiltration. For CISOs, the value is clear: it’s time to elevate DNS from a background role to a frontline preemptive weapon against cyberattacks.  Conduct assessments to determine the best solutions and the best platform to deploy.\n\t\t\t\nWhile often relegated to a purely functional role, DNS offers unparalleled opportunities for preemptive defense against cyberattacks. When harnessed correctly, DNS is the first line of defense. It can stop attacks before they succeed, disrupt command-and-control (C2) communications and data exfiltration, and provide invaluable insights for security operations centers (SOCs) during incident response. DNS in fact can also extend to secure every part of your network, from endpoints to cloud workloads and IoT/OT.\n\n\n\nIn fact, in 2020, the NSA started a pilot on protective DNS (they used the term “secure DNS” at the time) and concluded that they were able to reduce the ability of 92% of malware attacks to successfully deploy malware on a given network.\n\n\n\nEvolution Of AI-Powered Cyber Threats\nThe majority of security solutions today are right of “Boom” — reacting only after an attack has happened. When an initial infection happens (patient zero), security teams analyze the malware, domain or exploit and generate a signature or indicator of compromise (IOC) based on the attack. This signature or IOC is distributed to endpoint detection tools, antivirus solutions or intrusion detection systems, and shows up in VirusTotal and OSINT (open source intelligence) tools. The rest of the industry can now block this attack, because of this first victim or infection.\n\n\n\nThe rise of AI in the hands of cybercriminals has dramatically reshaped the threat landscape. Threat actors now leverage AI to:\n\n\n\n\nGenerate polymorphic malware: AI-driven malware continuously evolves its code to evade signature-based detection, making traditional security tools ineffective against rapidly morphing threats.\nAutomate phishing campaigns: AI crafts highly personalized phishing emails and generates fake websites that mimic legitimate ones with alarming accuracy, increasing the success rate of attacks.\nScale malicious infrastructure: AI-powered tools allow cybercriminals to rapidly create new domains, IP addresses, and hosting services, making detection and takedown efforts far more challenging. Registered domain generation algorithms (RDGAs) are a programmatic mechanism that allows threat actors to create many domain names at once or over time and register them for use in their infrastructure.\n\nAs a result, every threat and malware variant may be unique and highly targeted, forcing security teams to combat hundreds of thousands—or even millions—of patient zeros. Existing solutions simply cannot keep up–it would be like playing a cybersecurity game of whack-a-mole. This shift necessitates a different approach to cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nDNS as a Preemptive Cybersecurity WeaponAdvertisement.

For CISOs, the value is clear: it’s time to elevate DNS from a background role to a frontline preemptive weapon against cyberattacks.  Conduct assessments to determine the best solutions and the best platform to deploy.\n\t\t\t\nDanelle is a seasoned product and solutions marketing leader with expertise in bringing disruptive security, cloud and AI technologies to market.
