        "Content": "The cascading supply chain attack that\ninitially targeted Coinbase\nbefore becoming more widespread to single out users of the \"tj-actions/changed-files\" GitHub Action has been traced further back to the theft of a personal access token (\nPAT\n) related to SpotBugs.\n\"The attackers obtained initial access by taking advantage of the GitHub Actions workflow of SpotBugs, a popular open-source tool for static analysis of bugs in code,\" Palo Alto Networks Unit 42\nsaid\nin an update this week. \"This enabled the attackers to move laterally between SpotBugs repositories, until obtaining access to reviewdog.\"\nThere is evidence to suggest that the malicious activity began as far back as November, 2024, although the attack against Coinbase did not take place until March 2025.\nUnit 42 said its investigation began with the knowledge that reviewdog's GitHub Action was compromised due to a leaked PAT associated with the project's maintainer, which subsequently enabled the threat actors to push a rogue version of \"reviewdog/action-setup\" that, in turn, was picked up by \"tj-actions/changed-files\" due to it being listed as a dependency via the \"tj-actions/eslint-changed-files\" action.\nIt has since been uncovered that the maintainer was also an active participant in another open-source project called SpotBugs.\nThe attackers are said to have pushed a malicious GitHub Actions workflow file to the \"spotbugs/spotbugs\" repository under the disposable username \"jurkaofavak,\" causing the maintainer's PAT to be leaked when the workflow was executed.\nIt's believed that the same PAT facilitated access to both \"spotbugs/spotbugs\" and \"reviewdog/action-setup,\" meaning the leaked PAT could be abused to poison \"reviewdog/action-setup.\"\n\"The attacker somehow had an account with write permission in spotbugs/spotbugs, which they were able to use to push a branch to the repository and access the CI secrets,\" Unit 42 said.\nAs for how the write permissions were obtained, it has come to light that the user behind the malicious commit to SpotBugs, \"jurkaofavak,\" was invited to the repository as a member by one of the project maintainers themselves on March 11, 2025.\nIn other words, the attackers managed to obtain the PAT of the SpotBugs repository to invite \"jurkaofavak\" to become a member. This, the cybersecurity company said, was carried out by creating a fork of the \"spotbugs/sonar-findbugs\" repository and creating a pull request under the username \"randolzfow.\"\n\"On 2024-11-28T09:45:13 UTC, [the SpotBugs maintainer] modified one of the 'spotbugs/sonar-findbugs workflows to use their own PAT, as they were having technical difficulties in a part of their CI/CD process,\" Unit 42 explained.\n\"On 2024-12-06 02:39:00 UTC, the attacker submitted a\nmalicious pull request\nto spotbugs/sonar-findbugs, which exploited a GitHub Actions workflow that used the\npull_request_target\ntrigger.\"\nThe \"pull_request_target\" trigger is a GitHub Actions workflow trigger that allows workflows running from forks to access secrets – in this case, the PAT – leading to what's called a poisoned pipeline execution attack (PPE).\nThe SpotBugs maintainer has since confirmed that the PAT that was used as a secret in the workflow was the same access token that was later used to invite \"jurkaofavak\" to the \"spotbugs/spotbugs\" repository. The maintainer has also rotated all of their tokens and PATs to revoke and prevent further access by the attackers.\nOne major unknown in all this is the three-month gap between when the attackers leaked the SpotBugs maintainer's PAT and when they abused it. It's suspected that the attackers were keeping an eye out on the projects that were dependent on \"tj-actions/changed-files\" and waited to strike a high-value target like Coinbase.\n\"Having invested months of effort and after achieving so much, why did the attackers print the secrets to logs, and in doing so, also reveal their attack?,\" Unit 42 researchers pondered.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "There's a virtuous cycle in technology that pushes the boundaries of what's being built and how it's being used. A new technology development emerges and captures the world's attention. People start experimenting and discover novel applications, use cases, and approaches to maximize the innovation's potential. These use cases generate significant value, fueling demand for the next iteration of the innovation, and in turn, a new wave of innovators create the next generation of use cases, driving further advancements.\nContainerization has become the foundation of modern, cloud-native software development, supporting new use cases and approaches to building resilient, scalable, and portable applications. It also holds the keys to the next software delivery innovation, simultaneously necessitating the evolution to secure-by-design, continuously-updated software and serving as the means to get there.\nBelow, I'll talk through some of the innovations that led to our containerized revolution, as well as some of the traits of cloud-native software development that have led to this inflection point – one that has primed the world to move away from traditional Linux distros and towards a new approach to open source software delivery.\nIteration has moved us closer to ubiquity\nThere have been many innovations that have paved the way for more secure, performant open source delivery. In the interest of your time and my word count I'll call out three particular milestones. Each step, from Linux Containers (LXC) to Docker and ultimately the Open Container Initiative (OCI), built upon its predecessor, addressing limitations and unlocking new possibilities.\nLXC laid the groundwork by harnessing the Linux kernel's capabilities (namely cgroups and namespaces), to create lightweight, isolated environments. For the first time, developers could package applications with their dependencies, offering a degree of consistency across different systems. However, LXC's complexity for users and its lack of a standardized image distribution catalog hindered widespread adoption.\nDocker emerged as a game-changer, democratizing container technology. It simplified the process of creating, running, and sharing containers, making them accessible to a broader audience. Docker's user-friendly interface and the creation of Docker Hub, a central repository for container images, fostered a vibrant ecosystem. This ease of use fueled rapid adoption, but also raised concerns about vendor lock-in and the need for interoperability.\nRecognizing the potential for fragmentation, the OCI (Open Containers Initiative) stepped in to standardize container formats and runtimes. By defining open specifications, the OCI ensured that containers could be built and run across different platforms, fostering a healthy, competitive landscape. Projects like runC and containerd, born from the OCI, provided a common foundation for container runtimes and enabled greater portability and interoperability.\nThe OCI standards also enabled Kubernetes (another vendor-neutral standard) to become a truly portable platform, capable of running on a wide range of infrastructure and allowing organizations to orchestrate their applications consistently across different cloud providers and on-premises environments. This standardization and its associated innovations unlocked the full potential of containers, paving the way for their ubiquitous presence in modern software development.\n[Containerized] software is eating the world\nThe advancements in Linux, the rapid democratization of containers through Docker, and the standardization of OCI were all propelled by necessity, with the evolution of cloud-native app use cases pushing orchestration and standardization forward. Those cloud-native application characteristics also highlight why a general-purpose approach to Linux distros no longer serves software developers with the most secure, updated foundations to develop on:\nMicroservice-oriented architecture: Cloud-native applications are typically built as a collection of small, independent services, with each microservice performing a specific function. Each of these microservices can be built, deployed, and maintained independently, which provides a tremendous amount of flexibility and resiliency. Because each microservice is independent, software builders don't require comprehensive software packages to run a microservice, relying only on the bare essentials within a container.\nResource-conscious and efficient: Cloud-native applications are built to be efficient and resource-conscious to minimize loads on infrastructure. This stripped down approach naturally aligns well with containers and an ephemeral deployment strategy, with new containers being deployed constantly and other workloads being updated to the latest code available. This cuts down security risks by taking advantage of the newest software packages, rather than waiting for distro patches and backports.\nPortability: Cloud-native applications are designed to be portable, with consistent performance and reliability regardless of where the application is running. As a result of containers standardizing the environment, developers can move beyond the age-old \"it worked fine on my machine\" headaches of the past.\nThe virtuous cycle of innovation driving new use cases and ultimately new innovations is clear when it comes to containerization and the widespread adoption of cloud-native applications. Critically, this inflection point of innovation and use case demands has driven an incredible rate of change within open source software — we've reached a point where the security, performance, and innovation drawbacks of traditional \"frozen-in-time\" Linux distros outweigh the familiarity and perceived stability of the last generation of software delivery.\nSo what should the next generation of open source software delivery look like?\nEnter: Chainguard OS\nTo meet modern security, performance, and productivity expectations, software builders need the latest software in the smallest form designed for their use case, without any of the CVEs that lead to risk for the business (and a list of \"fix-its\" from the security teams). Making good on those parameters requires more than just making over the past. Instead, the next generation of open source software delivery needs to start from the source of secure, updated software: the upstream maintainers.\nThat's why\nChainguard\nbuilt this new distroless approach, continuously rebuilding software packages based not on downstream distros but on the upstream sources that are removing vulnerabilities and adding performance improvements. We call it\nChainguard OS\n.\nChainguard OS serves as the foundation for the broad security, efficiency, and productivity outcomes that Chainguard products deliver today, \"Chainguarding\" a rapidly growing catalog of over 1,000 container images.\nChainguard OS adheres to four key principles to make that possible:\nContinuous Integration and Delivery: Emphasizes the continuous integration, testing, and release of upstream software packages, ensuring a streamlined and efficient development pipeline through automation.\nNano Updates and Rebuilds: Favors non-stop incremental updates and rebuilds over major release upgrades, ensuring smoother transitions and minimizing disruptive changes.\nMinimal, Hardened, Immutable Artifacts: Strips away unnecessary vendor bloat from software artifacts, making sidecar packages and extras optional to the user while enhancing security through hardening measures.\nDelta Minimization: Keeps deviations from upstream to a minimum, incorporating extra patches only when essential and only for as long as necessary until a new release is cut from upstream.\nPerhaps the best way to highlight the value of Chainguard OS's principles is to see the impact in Chainguard Images.\nIn the below screenshot (and viewable\nhere\n), you can see a side-by-side comparison between an external <python:latest> and <cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest> Chainguard Image.\nAside from the very clear discrepancy in the vulnerability count, it's worth examining the size difference between the two container images. The Chainguard image comprises just 6% of the open source alternative image.\nAlong with the minimized image size, the Chainguard image was last updated just an hour prior to the screengrab, something that happens daily:\nA quick scan of the provenance and SBOM data illustrates the end-to-end integrity and immutability of the artifacts — a kind of complete nutrition label that underscores the security and transparency that a modern approach to open source software delivery can provide.\nEach Chainguard image stands as a practical example of the value Chainguard OS provides, offering a stark alternative to what has come before it. Perhaps the greatest indicator is the feedback we've received from customers, who have shared how Chainguard's container images have helped eliminate CVEs, secure their supply chains, achieve and maintain compliance, and reduce developer toil, enabling them to re-allocate precious developer resources.\nOur belief is that Chainguard OS's principles and approach can be applied to a variety of use cases, extending the benefits of continuously rebuilt-from-source software packages to even more of the open source ecosystem.\nIf you found this useful, be sure to check out\nour whitepaper\non this subject or\ncontact our team\nto talk to an expert on Chainguard's distroless approach.\nNote:\nThis article is expertly written and contributed by\nDustin Kirkland\n— VP of Engineering at\nChainguard\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

There is no evidence that Policy Secure or ZTA gateways have come under in-the-wild abuse.\n\"Customers should monitor their external ICT and look for web server crashes,\" Ivanti noted. \"If your ICT result shows signs of compromise, you should perform a factory reset on the appliance and then put the appliance back into production using version 22.7R2.6.\"\nIt's worth mentioning here that Connect Secure version 22.7R2.6 also\naddressed\nmultiple critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-38657, CVE-2025-22467, and CVE-2024-10644) that could permit a remote authenticated attacker to write arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code.\nGoogle-owned Mandiant, in a\nbulletin\nof its own, said it observed evidence of exploitation of CVE-2025-22457 in mid-March 2025, allowing the threat actors to deliver an in-memory dropper called TRAILBLAZE, a passive backdoor codenamed BRUSHFIRE, and the SPAWN malware suite.\nThe attack chain essentially involves the use of a multi-stage shell script dropper to execute TRAILBLAZE, which then injects BRUSHFIRE directly into the memory of a running web process in an attempt to sidestep detection. The exploitation activity is designed to establish persistent backdoor access on compromised appliances, potentially enabling credential theft, further network intrusion, and data exfiltration.\nThe SPAWN malware ecosystem includes the below components -\nSPAWNSLOTH, a log tampering utility that can disable logging and disable log forwarding to an external syslog server when the\nSPAWNSNAIL\nbackdoor is operating\nSPAWNSNARE, a C-based program that's used to extract the uncompressed linux kernel image (vmlinux) into a file and encrypt it using AES\nSPAWNWAVE, an improved version of SPAWNANT that combines various elements of SPAWN (overlaps with SPAWNCHIMERA and RESURGE)\nThe use of SPAWN is\nattributed\nto a China-nexus adversary tracked as UNC5221, which has a\nhistory\nof\nleveraging\nzero-day flaws in Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) devices, alongside\nother clusters\nsuch as UNC5266, UNC5291, UNC5325, UNC5330, UNC5337, and UNC3886.\nUNC5221, per\nthe U.S. government\n, has also been assessed to share overlaps with threat groups such as\nAPT27\n, Silk Typhoon, and\nUTA0178\n. However, the threat intelligence firm told The Hacker News that it does not have enough evidence on its own to confirm this connection.\n\"Mandiant tracks UNC5221 as a cluster of activity that has repeatedly exploited edge devices with zero-day vulnerabilities,\" Dan Perez, China Mission Technical Lead, Google Threat Intelligence Group, told the publication.\n\"The link between this cluster and APT27 made by the government is plausible, but we do not have independent evidence to confirm. Silk Typhoon is Microsoft's name for this activity, and we can't speak to their attribution.\"\nBesides conducting zero-day exploitation of\nCVE-2023-4966\n, affecting Citrix NetScaler devices, UNC5221 has leveraged an obfuscation network of compromised Cyberoam appliances, QNAP devices, and ASUS routers to mask their true source during intrusion operations, an aspect also\nhighlighted\nby Microsoft early last month, detailing Silk Typhoon's latest tradecraft.\nThe company further theorized that the threat actor likely analyzed the February patch released by Ivanti and figured out a way to exploit prior versions in order to achieve remote code execution against unpatched systems. The development marks the first time UNC5221 has been attributed to the N-day exploitation of a security flaw in Ivanti devices.\n\"This latest activity from UNC5221 underscores the ongoing targeting of edge devices globally by China-nexus espionage groups,\" Charles Carmakal, Mandiant Consulting CTO, said.\n\"These actors will continue to research security vulnerabilities and develop custom malware for enterprise systems that don't support EDR solutions. The velocity of cyber intrusion activity by China-nexus espionage actors continues to increase and these actors are better than ever.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "​Port of Seattle, the U.S. government agency overseeing Seattle's seaport and airport, is notifying roughly 90,000 individuals of a data breach after their personal information was stolen in an August 2024 ransomware attack.\nThe agency\ndisclosed the attack on August 24\n, saying the resulting IT outage disrupted multiple services and systems, including reservation check-in systems, passenger display boards, the Port of Seattle website, the flySEA app, and delayed flights at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.\nThree weeks after the initial disclosure, the Port\nconfirmed\nthat the Rhysida ransomware operation was behind the August 2024 breach.\nAfter the incident, the Port also decided not to give in to the cybercriminals' demands to pay for a decryptor even though they threatened to publish stolen data on their dark web leak site.\n\"We have refused to pay the ransom demanded, and as a result, the actor may respond by posting data they claim to have stolen on their darkweb site,\" the\nPort of Seattle said\non September 13, 2024.\n\"Our investigation of what data the actor took is ongoing, but it does appear that some Port data was obtained by the actor in mid-to-late August. Assessment of the data taken is complex and takes time.\"\n​Data breach impacts roughly 90,000 people\nOn Thursday, April 3, 2025, the Port announced that it's now sending approximately 90,000 notification letters to individuals impacted by the resulting data breach who had a mailing address. According to the agency, roughly 71,000 of those affected by this data breach are from Washington state.\nAccording to a\ncopy of the breach notification letters\n, the attackers stole employee, contractor, and parking data in various combinations, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers (or last four digits of Social Security number), driver's license or other government identification card numbers, and some medical information.\nThe Port also said that it stores \"very little information\" on airport or maritime passengers and that its payment processing systems were unaffected by the attack.\n\"At no point did this incident affect the ability to safely travel to or from SEA Airport or use the Port's maritime facilities,\"\nthe Port added this week\n. \"The proprietary systems of major airline and cruise partners were not affected, nor were the systems of federal partners like the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\"\nRhysida, the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation behind the Port of Seattle attack, surfaced in May 2023 and quickly gained notoriety after breaching the\nBritish Library\n, the\nChilean Army (Ejército de Chile)\n,\nthe City of Columbus, Ohio\n,\nSony subsidiary Insomniac Games\n, and\nMarineMax\n(the world's largest recreational boat and yacht retailer).\nIts affiliates also breached Singing River Health System, which warned\nalmost 900,000 people\nthat their personal and health information had been stolen in an August 2023 Rhysida ransomware attack.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nPennsylvania education union data breach hit 500,000 people\nTexas State Bar warns of data breach after INC ransomware claims attack\nHellCat hackers go on a worldwide Jira hacking spree\nAustralian pension funds hit by wave of credential stuffing attacks\nEuropcar GitLab breach exposes data of up to 200,000 customers"

        "Content": "A large-scale phishing campaign dubbed 'PoisonSeed' compromises corporate email marketing accounts to distribute emails containing crypto seed phrases used to drain cryptocurrency wallets.\nAccording\nto SilentPush\n, the campaign targets Coinbase and Ledger using compromised accounts at Mailchimp, SendGrid, HubSpot, Mailgun, and Zoho.\nThe researchers link the campaign to recent incidents, such as the case of\nTroy Hunt's Mailchimp account\ncompromise from late last month and an\nAkamai SendGrid account hack\nBleepingComputer reported in mid-March 2025, where the legitimate account was used to send out Coinbase seed phrase phishing emails.\nAlthough the PoisonSeed campaign shares similarities with operations by the CryptoChameleon and Scattered Spider threat actors, Silent Push categorizes it separately due to code differences and other differentiating factors.\nPoisonSeed attack chain\nThe first step in the attack is to identify high-value targets with access to CRM and bulk email platforms. This can be done by checking what email companies use for their newsletters or marketing and finding employees in related positions.\nNext, they target them with professionally crafted phishing emails sent from spoofed addresses, taking them to fake login pages hosted on carefully named domains to appear legitimate.\nFor example, in emails targeting MailChimp customers, the threat actors used the domains mail-chimpservices[.]com, mailchimp-sso[.]com, and mailchimp-ssologin[.]com.\nPhishing email targeting Mailchimp accounts\nSource: SilentPush\nOnce their credentials are stolen, the attackers export mailing lists and generate new API keys to maintain access to the hijacked account even if the victim quickly changes their password.\nThe attacker then uses the compromised account to send crypto-themed phishing spam to the extracted mailing lists with alerts that prompt the recipient's action, like 'Coinbase is transitioning to self-custodial wallets.'\nThe phishing email includes a Coinbase wallet seed phrase, telling the user to enter it into a new crypto wallet as part of an upgrade or migration. If the victim follows this instruction and transfers their assets into it, they essentially \"poison\" their wallets, enabling the threat actors to access and drain them.\nCoinbase-themed email with seeds for the victim to use\nSource: SilentPush\nThat is because, when creating a new wallet, the victim isn't using a secure, pre-generated seed phrase from the company (Coinbase) like they are made to believe, but instead using one for a wallet already under the attackers' control.\nTransferring their crypto into that wallet is basically handing over all their digital assets to the attacker, who can then transfer the funds out.\nThe best way to deal with urgent requests arriving via email is to ignore them and independently (not by clicking on the embedded links) log in to the claimed platform and check if there are any pending alerts for your account.\nCryptocurrency wallet users should never use a seed phrase provided by someone else, as a legitimate platform will never send a pre-generated seed phrase. Users should always generate their own seed phrases when creating a new wallet and never share them with anyone else.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nCoinbase phishing email tricks users with fake wallet migration\nHacker steals record $1.46 billion from Bybit ETH cold wallet\nCrypto-stealing apps found in Apple App Store for the first time\nPhishing platform 'Lucid' behind wave of iOS, Android SMS attacks\nNorth Korean hackers adopt ClickFix attacks to target crypto firms"

While we took immediate action to lock these accounts and let those members know, there are things members can do right now to protect themselves online.\"\nRest revealed that\nits online MemberAccess portal was also targeted\nover the weekend of 29-30 March. Although it shut down the portal in reaction to the attacks, approximately 8,000 members had some limited personal information (including first name, email address, and member identification number) accessed. However, Rest says there is no evidence that the attackers transferred funds from compromised members' accounts.\nHostplus also noted that\nits members have lost no funds\ndue to these attacks and that the extent of the impact on their accounts is being investigated.\nWhile ASFA and the other affected super funds didn't share additional details on the account breaches, Insignia Financial says its Expand Platform\nwas hit by credential stuffing attacks\nwhere threat actors use stolen credentials and automated tools to gain access to user accounts. The attackers compromised around 100 Expand Wrap Platform customers' accounts, but Insignia's ongoing investigation has not found evidence of financial impact.\n\"As is good practice, we encourage customers not to reuse the same credentials across multiple platforms and services, set strong and unique passphrases, and install software updates regularly to keep their devices secure,\" said Liz McCarthy, CEO of Insignia Financial's MLC Expand retirement platform. \"We are communicating with impacted customers and their advisers and will continue to keep them updated.\"\nHESTA\nand\nMercer Super\n, two other Australian super fund who manage savings for more than 2 million members, said they weren't affected.\nOn Friday, ASFA announced the establishment of a hotline connecting superannuation industry organizations, government agencies, and financial services bodies and the release of a \"Toolkit\" to ensure strong sector coordination as part of its Financial Crime Protection Initiative (FCPI).\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nAustralian fertility services giant Genea hit by security breach\nFintech giant Finastra notifies victims of October data breach\nOracle privately confirms Cloud breach to customers\nRetail giant Sam’s Club investigates Clop ransomware breach claims\nOracle denies breach after hacker claims theft of 6 million data records"

        "Content": "A Minnesota cybersecurity and computer forensics expert whose testimony has featured in thousands of courtroom trials over the past 30 years is facing questions about his credentials and an inquiry from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Legal experts say the inquiry could be grounds to reopen a number of adjudicated cases in which the expert’s testimony may have been pivotal.\nOne might conclude from reading Mr. Lanterman’s LinkedIn profile that has a degree from Harvard University.\nMark Lanterman is a former investigator for the U.S. Secret Service Electronics Crimes Task Force who founded the Minneapolis consulting firm Computer Forensic Services (CFS). The CFS website says Lanterman’s 30-year career has seen him testify as an expert in more than 2,000 cases, with experience in cases involving sexual harassment and workplace claims, theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, white-collar crime, and class action lawsuits.\nOr at least it did until last month, when Lanterman’s profile and work history were quietly removed from the CFS website. The removal came after Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said it was notifying parties to ten pending cases that they were unable to verify Lanterman’s educational and employment background. The county attorney also said the FBI is now investigating the allegations.\nThose allegations were raised by Sean Harrington, an attorney and forensics examiner based in Prescott, Wisconsin. Harrington alleged that Lanterman lied under oath in court on multiple occasions when he testified that he has a Bachelor of Science and a Master’s degree in computer science from the now-defunct Upsala College, and that he completed his postgraduate work in cybersecurity at Harvard University.\nHarrington’s claims gained steam thanks to digging by the law firm Perkins Coie LLP, which is defending a case wherein a client’s laptop was forensically reviewed by Lanterman. On March 14, Perkins Coie attorneys asked the judge (PDF) to strike Lanterman’s testimony because neither he nor they could substantiate claims about his educational background.\nUpsala College, located in East Orange, N.J., operated for 102 years until it closed in 1995 after a period of declining enrollment and financial difficulties. Perkins Coie told the court that they’d visited Felician University, which holds the transcripts for Upsala College during the years Lanterman claimed to have earned undergraduate and graduate degrees. The law firm said Felician had no record of transcripts for Lanterman (PDF), and that his name was absent from all of the Upsala College student yearbooks and commencement programs during that period.\nReached for comment, Lanterman acknowledged he had no way to prove he attended Upsala College, and that his “postgraduate work” at Harvard was in fact an eight-week online cybersecurity class called HarvardX, which cautions that its certificates should not be considered equivalent to a Harvard degree or a certificate earned through traditional, in-person programs at Harvard University.\nLanterman has testified that his first job after college was serving as a police officer in Springfield Township, Pennsylvania, although the Perkins Coie attorneys noted that this role was omitted from his resume. The attorneys said when they tried to verify Lanterman’s work history, “the police department responded with a story that would be almost impossible to believe if it was not corroborated by Lanterman’s own email communications.”\nAs recounted in the March 14 filing, Lanterman was deposed on Feb. 11, and the following day he emailed the Springfield Township Police Department to see if he could have a peek at his old personnel file. On Feb. 14, Lanterman visited the Springfield Township PD and asked to borrow his employment record. He told the officer he spoke with on the phone that he’d recently been instructed to “get his affairs in order” after being diagnosed with a grave heart condition, and that he wanted his old file to show his family about his early career.\nAccording to Perkins Coie, Lanterman left the Springfield Township PD with his personnel file, and has not returned it as promised.\n“It is shocking that an expert from Minnesota would travel to suburban Philadelphia and abscond with his decades-old personnel file to obscure his background,” the law firm wrote. “That appears to be the worst and most egregious form of spoliation, and the deception alone is reason enough to exclude Lanterman and consider sanctions.”\nHarrington initially contacted KrebsOnSecurity about his concerns in late 2023, fuming after sitting through a conference speech in which Lanterman shared documents from a ransomware victim and told attendees it was because they’d refused to hire his company to perform a forensic investigation on a recent breach.\n“He claims he was involved in the Martha Stewart investigation, the Bernie Madoff trial, Paul McCartney’s divorce, the Tom Petters investigation, the Denny Hecker investigation, and many others,” Harrington said. “He claims to have been invited to speak to the Supreme Court, claims to train the ‘entire federal judiciary’ on cybersecurity annually, and is a faculty member of the United States Judicial Conference and the Judicial College — positions which he obtained, in part, on a house of fraudulent cards.”\nIn an interview this week, Harrington said court documents reveal that at least two of Lanterman’s previous clients complained CFS had held their data for ransom over billing disputes. In a declaration (PDF) dated August 2022, the co-founder of the law firm MoreLaw Minneapolis LLC said she hired Lanterman in 2014 to examine several electronic devices after learning that one of their paralegals had a criminal fraud history.\nBut the law firm said when it pushed back on a consulting bill that was far higher than expected, Lanterman told them CFS would “escalate” its collection efforts if they didn’t pay, including “a claim and lien against the data which will result in a public auction of your data.”\n“All of us were flabbergasted by Mr. Lanterman’s email,” wrote MoreLaw co-founder Kimberly Hanlon. “I had never heard of any legitimate forensic company threatening to ‘auction’ off an attorney’s data, particularly knowing that the data is comprised of confidential client data, much of which is sensitive in nature.”\nIn 2009, a Wisconsin-based manufacturing company that had hired Lanterman for computer forensics balked at paying an $86,000 invoice from CFS, calling it “excessive and unsubstantiated.” The company told a Hennepin County court that on April 15, 2009, CFS conducted an auction of its trade secret information in violation of their confidentiality agreement.\n“CFS noticed and conducted a Public Sale of electronic information that was entrusted to them pursuant to the terms of the engagement agreement,” the company wrote. “CFS submitted the highest bid at the Public Sale in the amount of $10,000.”\n\nLanterman briefly responded to a list of questions about his background (and recent heart diagnosis) on March 24, saying he would send detailed replies the following day. Those replies never materialized. Instead, Lanterman forwarded a recent memo he wrote to the court that attacked Harrington and said his accuser was only trying to take out a competitor. He has not responded to further requests for comment.\n“When I attended Upsala, I was a commuter student who lived with my grandparents in Morristown, New Jersey approximately 30 minutes away from Upsala College,” Lanterman explained to the judge (PDF) overseeing a separate ongoing case (PDF) in which he has testified. “With limited resources, I did not participate in campus social events, nor did I attend graduation ceremonies. In 2023, I confirmed with Felician University — which maintains Upsala College’s records — that they could not locate my transcripts or diploma, a situation that they indicated was possibly due to unresolved money-related issues.”\nLanterman was ordered to appear in court on April 3 in the case defended by Perkins Coie, but he did not show up. Instead, he sent a message to the judge withdrawing from the case.\n“I am 60 years old,” Lanterman told the judge. “I created my business from nothing. I am done dealing with the likes of individuals like Sean Harrington. And quite frankly, I have been planning at turning over my business to my children for years. That time has arrived.”\nLanterman’s letter leaves the impression that it was his decision to retire. But according to an affidavit (PDF) filed in a Florida case on March 28, Mark Lanterman’s son Sean said he’d made the difficult decision to ask his dad to step down given all the negative media attention.\nMark Rasch, a former federal cybercrime prosecutor who now serves as counsel to the New York cybersecurity intelligence firm Unit 221B, said that if an expert witness is discredited, any defendants who lost cases that were strongly influenced by that expert’s conclusions at trial could have grounds for appeal.\nRasch said law firms who propose an expert witness have a duty in good faith to vet that expert’s qualifications, knowing that those credentials will be subject to cross-examination.\n“Federal rules of civil procedure and evidence both require experts to list every case they have testified in as an expert for the past few years,” Rasch said. “Part of that due diligence is pulling up the results of those cases and seeing what the nature of their testimony has been.”\nPerhaps the most well-publicized case involving significant forensic findings from Lanterman was the 2018 conviction of Stephen Allwine, who was found guilty of killing his wife two years earlier after attempts at hiring a hitman on the dark net fell through. Allwine is serving a sentence of life in prison, and continues to maintain that he was framed, casting doubt on computer forensic evidence found on 64 electronic devices taken from his home.\nOn March 24, Allwine petitioned a Minnesota court (PDF) to revisit his case, citing the accusations against Lanterman and his role as a key witness for the prosecution.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Friday 4th of April 2025 12:37 PM \r\n         \nIsn’t this the guy who claimed to review ‘Hunter Biden’s’ laptop? https://www.yahoo.com/news/forensic-analysis-copy-hunter-biden-231418826.html\nCurious that he didn’t even understand basic chain of custody. Isn’t it.\nOnce again Brian – you get us all the great scoops!!  I met Mark years ago at some conference, and all I came away with was the fact the guy thought he was God’s right hand, and he seemed to basically be a DICKFER……  For once, it’s nice to see one of these doofuses get his…..\nThat background should qualify him for a key position on the DOGE team.\nIf cases like this could be made into a movie series or podcast for reference and analysis, they would certainly be an attractive topic, attracting a lot of attention.\nYour email address will not be published.

It was patched by the third-party owner of the application in mid-March, Verizon told SecurityWeek. \n\n\n\nConnelly discovered that when the app displayed the user’s incoming call history, it made a request to a server which provided the information. That request contained the user’s phone number and the timeframe for which the call records were requested.\n\n\n\nHowever, the endpoint the requests were sent to failed to check that the phone number specified in the request actually belonged to the user. This could have enabled an attacker to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint with an arbitrary phone number to obtain incoming call records for that number.\n\n\n\nNo other information beyond phone numbers and timestamps associated with incoming calls appears to have been exposed.\n\n\n\nConnelly did not determine whether the flaw could have been exploited against any Verizon customer or just users who have the Verizon Call Filter service enabled.\n\n\n\n“I believe this service may be on by default for many/all Verizon Wireless customers, so in either case, it does seem this issue impacted either nearly all, or all customers,” the researcher said in a blog post.   Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nVerizon has over 140 million subscribers and its statement does not indicate that the company is disputing the researcher’s claims about millions of users potentially being impacted by the vulnerability. \n\n\n\n“Call metadata might seem harmless, but in the wrong hands, it becomes a powerful surveillance tool. With unrestricted access to another user’s call history, an attacker could reconstruct daily routines, identify frequent contacts, and infer personal relationships,” the researcher said.\n\n\n\n“Timestamps can be cross-referenced with social media or public sightings to map physical movements. Repeated numbers expose private or burner lines, compromising whistleblowers, journalists, or abuse survivors,” he added. \n\n\n\nA recent China-linked hacking campaign targeting several telecom companies has shown that call data may be valuable to threat actors.\n\n\n\n“While there was no indication that the flaw was exploited, the issue was resolved and only impacted iOS devices. Verizon appreciates the responsible disclosure of the finding by the researcher and takes the security very seriously,” Verizon said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAs for Verizon mentioning that the vulnerable application is developed by a third party, Connelly’s research indeed indicates that the Verizon Call Filter app is made by Cequint, a company focusing on caller ID services. \n\n\n\nConnelly previously discovered a vulnerability in a Tesla tool that could have been exploited to take over accounts of former employees.\n\n\n\nRelated: Halo ITSM Vulnerability Exposed Organizations to Remote Hacking\nRelated: Abandoned Amazon S3 Buckets Could Have Enabled Attacks Against Governments, Big Firms\nRelated: Critical Apache Parquet Vulnerability Leads to Remote Code Execution\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered by cybersecurity researcher Evan Connelly in Verizon Call Filter, an iPhone application that allows users to identify suspected spam calls and automatically block such calls. \n\n\n\nThe issue was reported to Verizon on February 22.

One advisory describes two high-severity and two medium-severity flaws in RTU500 series products that can be exploited for DoS attacks. The second advisory describes three medium-severity vulnerabilities in the TRMTracker application that can allow remote command execution, web cache poisoning, and sensitive information disclosure.  \n\n\n\nApple improvements for malware detection\nApple security expert Patrick Wardle reported that upcoming versions of macOS will make it easier for security products to detect when a piece of malware may be trying to bypass ​​Transparency Consent and Control (TCC), the framework that manages access to sensitive user data on macOS. In most cases, macOS malware bypasses TCC by tricking the user into clicking a button to allow a TCC exception. In order to allow security products to detect potential TCC attacks, Apple is adding TCC events to the Endpoint Security system. Some issues identified in the beta version of macOS still need to be addressed, but Wardle is hopeful. Advertisement.

For that, threat actors link a domain name to multiple IP addresses and frequently rotate those in DNS responses.\n\n\n\nThe setup ensures that a domain remains accessible even if one of the IP addresses associated with it is taken down, thus allowing threat actors to establish persistent command-and-control (C&C) servers, cybersecurity agencies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US say.\n\n\n\nIn a joint alert (PDF), the agencies note that fast flux and other dynamic resolution techniques are employed in attacks to evade detection and ensure that malware deployed within victims’ environments can communicate with its C&C servers.\n\n\n\nFor added redundancy, threat actors may employ the ‘double flux’ technique, which involves rapidly changing both the IP addresses of a domain and the DNS name servers resolving that domain. Both Name Server (NS) and Canonical Name (CNAME) DNS records have been used with double flux.\n\n\n\n“Both techniques leverage a large number of compromised hosts, usually as a botnet from across the internet that acts as proxies or relay points, making it difficult for network defenders to identify the malicious traffic and block or perform legal enforcement takedowns of the malicious infrastructure,” the alert reads.\n\n\n\nThreat actors observed employing the fast flux technique include bulletproof hosting services (which host malicious activities, provide anonymity to attackers and disregard law enforcement requests), the Hive and Nefilim ransomware groups, and Russian APT Gamaredon.\n\n\n\nIn addition to maintaining C&C communication, the fast flux technique is used to prevent the takedown of websites used for phishing, as well as to ensure the availability of cybercriminal forums and marketplaces.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nSome bulletproof hosting services, the authoring agencies say, promote fast flux as a service for their clients, enabling a broad range of malicious activities, beyond maintaining C&Cs.\n\n\n\nThe authoring agencies recommend that internet service providers (ISPs) and cybersecurity service providers leverage threat intelligence to identify domains and IP addresses employing fast flux; check DNS logs, DNS records, and DNS resolutions; identify large-scale communication with multiple IP addresses; develop fast flux detection algorithms; and share information with their customers.\n\n\n\nGovernment and critical infrastructure organizations are advised to coordinate with ISPs, cybersecurity providers, and other protective DNS services to implement DNS and IP blocking and sinkholing, reputational filtering, and enhanced monitoring and logging.\n\n\n\n“Fast flux represents a persistent threat to network security, leveraging rapidly changing infrastructure to obfuscate malicious activity. By implementing robust detection and mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of compromise by fast flux-enabled threats,” the authoring agencies note.\n\n\n\nRelated: Morphing Meerkat Phishing Kits Target Over 100 Brands\nRelated: Chinese Hackers Deliver Malware via ISP-Level DNS Poisoning\nRelated: Attackers Use DNS Tunneling to Track Victim Activity, Scan Networks\nRelated: Expired Domain Allowed Researcher to Hijack Country’s TLD\n\nFast flux involves the rapid change of Domain Name System (DNS) records of malicious servers, which prevents tracking.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nOracle has confirmed suffering a data breach but the tech giant is apparently trying to downplay the impact of the incident.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nOracle is privately confirming to customers that some of its cloud systems have been breached, and is apparently trying to downplay the impact of the incident.\nA hacker who uses the online moniker ‘rose87168’ recently offered to sell millions of lines of data allegedly associated with over 140,000 Oracle Cloud tenants, including encrypted credentials. The hacker initially hoped to extort a $20 million payment from Oracle, but later offered to sell the data to anyone or trade it for zero-day exploits.\n\n\n\nAfter the hacker’s claims came to light, Oracle categorically denied an Oracle Cloud hack, saying, “There has been no breach of Oracle Cloud. The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data.” \n\n\n\nHowever, the hacker has been sharing various types of information to prove their claims, including a sample of 10,000 customer data records, a link to a file demonstrating access to Oracle cloud systems, user credentials, and a lengthy video that appears to have been recorded during an internal Oracle meeting. \n\n\n\nSeveral security firms pointed out that the leaked customer information seems genuine and associated with a production environment. SecurityWeek and others have received confirmation from some Oracle Cloud customers that their data was included in the leak. \n\n\n\nSecurityWeek has requested a statement from Oracle several times since the incident has come to light, but the company has not responded beyond the initial statement categorically denying a breach. \n\n\n\nHowever, there are now several independent reports of Oracle privately notifying impacted customers and confirming that a data breach has occurred. On the other hand, details remain murky and there appears to be some conflicting information.\n\n\n\nBloomberg has learned from people familiar with the matter that Oracle has started privately informing customers of a data breach impacting usernames, passkeys and encrypted passwords. The FBI and CrowdStrike are reportedly investigating the incident. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nAccording to some of Bloomberg’s sources, Oracle is telling customers that the incident involved a legacy environment that has not been in use for eight years and the compromised credentials pose little risk. A different source told the publication that some of the compromised credentials are from 2024. \n\n\n\nSecurity firm CyberAngel learned from an unnamed source that ‘Gen 1’ cloud servers were impacted — newer ‘Gen 2’ servers were not — and the compromised information is at least 16 months old and does not include full personal details. \n\n\n\n“Our source, who we are not naming as requested, is reporting that Oracle has allegedly determined an attacker who was in the shared identity service as early as January 2025,” Cyber Angel said.\n\n\n\n“This exposure was facilitated via a 2020 Java exploit and the hacker was able to install a webshell along with malware. The malware specifically targeted the Oracle IDM database and was able to exfil data. Oracle allegedly became aware of a potential breach in late February and investigated this issue internally,” it added. “Within days, Oracle reportedly was able to remove the actor when the first demand for ransom was made in early March.”\n\n\n\nThe hacker has been claiming that information from 2025 was also compromised. \n\n\n\nCybersecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont, who has been following the story, learned from Oracle cloud customers that the notifications from the tech giant have been only verbal — there are no written notifications. \n\n\n\nBeaumont believes that ‘Gen 1’ servers may be referring to Oracle Classic, the name given to old Oracle Cloud services. This “wordplay”, as Beaumont calls it, enables Oracle to deny that Oracle Cloud was breached. \n\n\n\n“Oracle are attempting to wordsmith statements around Oracle Cloud and use very specific words to avoid responsibility. This is not okay. Oracle need to clearly, openly and publicly communicate what happened, how it impacts customers, and what they’re doing about it,” the researcher said.\n\n\n\nReports of an apparently unrelated Oracle Health data breach have also been circulating over the past days. According to Bleeping Computer, the information of patients from multiple US healthcare organizations was compromised in that incident. \n\n\n\nRelated: Two CVEs, One Critical Flaw: Inside the CrushFTP Vulnerability Controversy\nRelated: TalkTalk Confirms Data Breach, Downplays Impact\nRelated: Conduent Confirms Cyberattack After Government Agencies Report Outages\n\nA hacker who uses the online moniker ‘rose87168’ recently offered to sell millions of lines of data allegedly associated with over 140,000 Oracle Cloud tenants, including encrypted credentials.

The FBI and CrowdStrike are reportedly investigating the incident. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nAccording to some of Bloomberg’s sources, Oracle is telling customers that the incident involved a legacy environment that has not been in use for eight years and the compromised credentials pose little risk. A different source told the publication that some of the compromised credentials are from 2024. \n\n\n\nSecurity firm CyberAngel learned from an unnamed source that ‘Gen 1’ cloud servers were impacted — newer ‘Gen 2’ servers were not — and the compromised information is at least 16 months old and does not include full personal details. \n\n\n\n“Our source, who we are not naming as requested, is reporting that Oracle has allegedly determined an attacker who was in the shared identity service as early as January 2025,” Cyber Angel said.\n\n\n\n“This exposure was facilitated via a 2020 Java exploit and the hacker was able to install a webshell along with malware. The malware specifically targeted the Oracle IDM database and was able to exfil data.

It is used by multiple analytics tools and programming languages.\n\n\n\nThe critical bug, tracked as CVE-2025-30065, carries a maximum severity rating of 10/10 and is described as a deserialization of untrusted data issue affecting the library’s parquet-avro module.\n\n\n\nThe flaw was likely introduced in version 1.8.0 of the library and was addressed with the release of Parquet version 1.15.1. However, users are advised to review all historic iterations of the library.\n\n\n\n“This vulnerability can impact data pipelines and analytics systems that import Parquet files, particularly when those files come from external or untrusted sources. If attackers can tamper with the files, the vulnerability may be triggered,” application security firm Endor Labs notes.\n\n\n\nThe security defect is triggered when a system reads a crafted Parquet file, resulting in remote code execution (RCE).\n\n\n\nBy exploiting the vulnerability, attackers could take control of vulnerable systems, steal or modify sensitive information, deploy ransomware and other types of malware, or shut down services, causing denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.\n\n\n\nAccording to Endor Labs, all systems that read or import Parquet files through big-data frameworks such as Hadoop or Spark, as well as applications that incorporate the Parquet Java code are vulnerable.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“If you are unsure whether your software stack uses Parquet, check with your vendors or developers – many data analytics and storage solutions include this library,” Endor Labs notes.\n\n\n\nThe application security firm notes that there is no evidence that CVE-2025-30065 has been exploited in the wild, but its severity suggests that attackers could soon add it to their arsenals.\n\n\n\nIn addition to updating to Parquet version 1.15.1, users are advised to be wary of Parquet files from unknown or untrusted sources and consider preventing their processing entirely. They should also implement efficient monitoring and logging capabilities to identify any suspicious behavior.\n\n\n\n“Watch for any further advisories from Apache or cybersecurity authorities. This vulnerability is evolving, and additional guidance or patches might emerge.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nEvidence shows a SpotBugs token compromised in December 2024 was used in the March 2025 GitHub Actions supply chain attack.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThreat actors used a personal access token (PAT) compromised in December 2024 to mount the March 2025 supply chain attack targeting GitHub Actions, Palo Alto Networks reports.\nOn March 14, the code of the tj-actions/changed-files GitHub action was altered to execute malicious code that would dump CI/CD secrets to build logs, likely in preparation of further attacks.\n\n\n\nOne week later, security researchers revealed that the attackers initially focused on exploiting an open source Coinbase project. After failing, however, they expanded their attack to all projects relying on the compromised action.\n\n\n\nDown the dependency tree, roughly 160,000 projects are using the compromised action directly or indirectly. However, only 218 repositories exposed secrets as result of this supply chain attack.\n\n\n\nThis week, Palo Alto Networks published an update to its investigation into the root cause of the attack, revealing that it all started with the compromise of a PAT in December last year.\n\n\n\nThe PAT belonged to a SpotBugs maintainer, and was added in late November to a spotbugs/sonar-findbugs workflow due to technical difficulties with a CI/CD process.\n\n\n\nThe token was stolen by a threat actor on December 6, through a malicious pull request submitted to spotbugs/sonar-findbugs to exploit GitHub Actions workflow using the pull_request_target trigger (which allows workflows that run from forks to access secrets).\n\n\n\nOn March 11, the threat actors used the PAT to invite a malicious user named jurkaofavak to the spotbugs/spotobugs repository as a member, which provided them with write access.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nTwo minutes later, the user pushed a malicious GitHub Actions workflow file to the repository, creating a malicious workflow that leaked all spotbugs/spotbugs secrets, including those of a Reviewdog maintainer that had access to both SpotBugs and Reviewdog repositories.\n\n\n\n“The workflow stringified all the available secrets, encrypted them with AES (symmetric encryption) and encrypted the symmetric key using a hard-coded RSA public key (asymmetric encryption). This ensured that the encrypted leaked secrets and their encryption key could only be decrypted and read by the attacker,” Palo Alto Networks explains.\n\n\n\nOn March 11, the attacker used the Reviewdog maintainer’s leaked PAT, which had permissions to push tags to the reviewdog/action-setup repository, to override the repo’s v1 tag to point to a malicious commit, impacting all consumers of the tag.\n\n\n\nThis led to the compromise of the tj-actions/eslint-changed-files action, which used reviewdog/action-setup as a dependency, subsequently leading to the compromise of the tj-actions/changed-files GitHub action.\n\n\n\nOn March 12, five days after a Coinbase maintainer created a workflow in coinbase/agentkit that depended on tj-actions/changed-files, the attacker prepared the attack by creating forks of tj-actions/changed-files and several Coinbase repositories.\n\n\n\nOn March 14, the malicious version of the tj-actions/changed-files GitHub action was executed by Coinbase, resulting in the exposure of a token with write permissions.\n\n\n\nThe vulnerable workflow of coinbase/agentkit was removed an hour and a half later, and the attacker pushed another malicious commit to tj-actions/changed-files, replacing all tags with malicious commits.\n\n\n\n“From that point of compromise, the attacker impacted every GitHub workflow run that depended on the tj-actions/changed-files action,” Palo Alto Networks says.\n\n\n\nThe cybersecurity firm says it has confirmed the findings of its investigation with the maintainers of Reviewdog and SpotBugs.\n\n\n\nRelated: Impact, Root Cause of GitHub Actions Supply Chain Hack Revealed\nRelated: 39 Million Secrets Leaked on GitHub in 2024\nRelated: GitHub Actions Artifacts Leak Tokens and Expose Cloud Services and Repositories\nRelated: Solana Web3.js Library Backdoored in Supply Chain Attack\n\nOn March 14, the code of the tj-actions/changed-files GitHub action was altered to execute malicious code that would dump CI/CD secrets to build logs, likely in preparation of further attacks.\n\n\n\nOne week later, security researchers revealed that the attackers initially focused on exploiting an open source Coinbase project.
