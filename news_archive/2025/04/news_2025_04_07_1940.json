It was first detected in the wild in 2007 as part of the Honeynet Project.\nIt can be either a single flux, where a single domain name is linked to numerous IP addresses, or double flux, where in addition to changing the IP addresses, the DNS name servers responsible for resolving the domain are also changed frequently, offering an extra layer of redundancy and anonymity for the rogue domains.\n\"A fast flux network is 'fast' because, using DNS, it quickly rotates through many bots, using each one for only a short time to make IP-based denylisting and takedown efforts difficult,\" Palo Alto Networks Unit 42\nsaid\nin a report published in 2021.\nDescribing fast flux as a national security threat, the agencies said threat actors are using the technique to obfuscate the locations of malicious servers, as well as establish resilient C2 infrastructure that can withstand takedown efforts.\nThat's not all. Fast flux plays a vital role beyond C2 communications to also help assist adversaries host phishing websites, as well as stage and distribute malware.\nTo secure against fast flux, organizations are recommended to block IP addresses, sinkhole malicious domains, filter out traffic to and from domains or IP addresses with poor reputations, implement enhanced monitoring, and enforce phishing awareness and training.\n\"Fast flux represents a persistent threat to network security, leveraging rapidly changing infrastructure to obfuscate malicious activity,\" the agencies said. \"By implementing robust detection and mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of compromise by fast flux-enabled threats.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Supply chains stretch deep into the code we trust, and malware hides not just in shady apps ‚Äî but in job offers, hardware, and cloud services we rely on every day.\nHackers don't need sophisticated exploits anymore. Sometimes, your credentials and a little social engineering are enough.\nThis week, we trace how simple oversights turn into major breaches ‚Äî and the silent threats most companies still underestimate.\nLet's dive in.\n‚ö° Threat of the Week\nUNC5221 Exploits New Ivanti Flaw to Drop Malware\n‚Äî The China-nexus cyber espionage group tracked as UNC5221\nexploited\na now-patched flaw in Ivanti Connect Secure, CVE-2025-22457 (CVSS score: 9.0), to deliver an in-memory dropper called TRAILBLAZE, a passive backdoor codenamed BRUSHFIRE, and the SPAWN malware suite. The vulnerability was originally patched by Ivanti on February 11, 2025, indicating that the threat actors studied the patch and figured out a way to exploit prior versions to breach unpatched systems. UNC5221 is believed to share overlaps with clusters tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the monikers APT27, Silk Typhoon, and UTA0178.\nStop AI-Powered Threats and Protect Sensitive Data with Zscaler Zero Trust + AI\nCompanies need to rethink how they protect their private and public use of AI and how they defend against AI-powered attacks. Traditional firewalls, VPNs, and public-facing IPs expose your attack surface and are no match in the AI era. It's time for a modern approach with Zscaler Zero Trust + AI.\nSee Zero Trust + AI in Action ‚ûù\nüîî Top News\nEncryptHub Unmasked as a Likely Lone Wolf Actor\n‚Äî An up-and-coming threat actor operating under the alias EncryptHub has been\nexposed\ndue to a series of operational security blunders. What distinguishes EncryptHub from other typical cybercriminals is the dichotomy of their online activities ‚Äì while conducting malicious campaigns, the individual simultaneously contributed to legitimate security research, even receiving acknowledgment from the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) last month for discovering and reporting CVE-2025-24061 and CVE-2025-2407. Another interesting aspect of EncryptHub is their use of OpenAI ChatGPAT as a \"partner in crime,\" leveraging it for malware development and translation tasks. In some particularly revealing conversations with the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, EncryptHub asked it to evaluate whether he was better suited to be a \"black hat or white hat\" hacker and if would be better being a \"a cool hacker or a malicious researcher,\" even going to the extent of confessing to his criminal activities and the exploits he had developed. \"When people think of cybercriminals, they tend to imagine high-tech, government-backed teams and elite hackers using cutting-edge technology,\" Outpost24 said. \"However, many hackers are normal people who at some point decided to follow a dark path.\"\nGitHub Action Supply Chain Traced Back to SpotBugs PAT Theft\n‚Äî The cascading supply chain attack that initially targeted Coinbase before becoming broader in scope to single out users of the \"tj-actions/changed-files\" GitHub Action has been\ntraced further back\nto the theft of a personal access token (PAT) associated with another open-source project called SpotBugs. The origins of the sophisticated breach are slowly coming into focus amid continued investigation, revealing how the initial compromise happened. It has now emerged that the popular static analysis tool, SpotBugs, was compromised in November 2024, using it as a stepping stone to compromise \"reviewdog/action-setup,\" which subsequently led to the infection of \"tj-actions/changed-files.\" This was made possible due to the fact that the maintainer of reviewdog also had access to SpotBugs repositories. The multi-step supply chain attack eventually went on to expose secrets in 218 repositories after the attackers failed in their attempt to breach Coinbase-related projects.\nContagious Interviews Adopts ClickFix and Spreads Fake npm Packages\n‚Äî The North Korean threat actors behind the ongoing Contagious Interview campaign have been observed adopting the infamous\nClickFix\nsocial engineering strategy to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor called GolangGhost. The adversarial collective have also published as many as\n11 npm packages\nthat deliver the BeaverTail information stealer malware, as well as a new remote access trojan (RAT) loader. The packages were downloaded more than 5,600 times prior to their removal. Meanwhile, North Korean IT workers are\nexpanding their efforts\nbeyond the U.S., and are seeking to fraudulently gain employment with organizations around the world, especially in Europe. Google researchers called out the IT warriors for engaging in \"a pattern of providing fabricated references, building a rapport with job recruiters, and using additional personas they controlled to vouch for their credibility.\" What's more, they are increasingly attempting to extort money from these companies once they get discovered and/or fired. In recent years, the U.S. government has made a concentrated push to raise awareness about the insider threat operation, to root out and punish U.S.-based facilitators of the fraudulent scheme, to uncover the IT workers and front companies that help these workers conceal their true origin, and to help organizations detect the risk before it's too late. In all probability, these heightened law enforcement efforts have caused the operators of the scheme to focus more on targets located elsewhere, while also driving them to embrace more aggressive measures to\nmaintain revenue streams\n.\nPhony Versions of Android Phones Come Preloaded with Triada Malware\n‚Äî Counterfeit versions of popular smartphone models that are sold at reduced prices have been found to be pre-installed with a modified version of an Android malware called\nTriada\n. A majority of infections have been reported in Russia. It's believed that the infections are the result of a hardware supply chain compromise, although Triada has been observed propagated via unofficial WhatsApp mods and third-party app marketplaces.\nBad Actors Abuse mu-plugins to Stash Malware\n‚Äî Threat actors are\nutilizing\nthe WordPress mu-plugins (\"must-use plugins\") directory to stealthily run malicious code on every page while evading detection. Because mu-plugins run on every page load and don't appear in the standard plugin list, they can be used to stealthily perform a wide range of malicious activity, such as stealing credentials, injecting malicious code, or altering HTML output.\n‚ÄéÔ∏è‚Äçüî• Trending CVEs\nAttackers love software vulnerabilities‚Äîthey're easy doors into your systems. Every week brings fresh flaws, and waiting too long to patch can turn a minor oversight into a major breach. Below are this week's critical vulnerabilities you need to know about. Take a look, update your software promptly, and keep attackers locked out.\nThis week's list includes ‚Äî\nCVE-2025-22457\n(Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA Gateway),\nCVE-2025-30065\n(Apache Parquet),\nCVE-2024-10668\n(Google Quick Share for Windows),\nCVE-2025-24362\n(github/codeql-action),\nCVE-2025-1268\n(Canon),\nCVE-2025-1449\n(Rockwell Automation Verve Asset Manager),\nCVE-2025-2008\n(WP Ultimate CSV Importer plugin),\nCVE-2024-3660\n(TensorFlow Keras),\nCVE-2025-20139\n(Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email),\nCVE-2025-20212\n(Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series),\nCVE-2025-27520\n(BentoML),\nCVE-2025-2798\n(Woffice CRM theme),\nCVE-2025-2780\n(Woffice Core plugin),\nCVE-2025-31553\n(WPFactory Advanced WooCommerce Product Sales Reporting plugin),\nCVE-2025-31579\n(EXEIdeas International WP AutoKeyword plugin), and\nCVE-2025-31552\n(RSVPMarker plugin).\nüì∞ Around the Cyber World\nOracle Privately Confirms Data Breach\n‚Äî Enterprise computing giant Oracle is reportedly informing its customers in private that it hackers compromised a \"legacy\" Oracle environment, exposing usernames, passkeys, and encrypted passwords, contradicting its consistent public denial about the incident. \"The company informed customers that the system hasn't been in use for eight years and that the stolen client credentials therefore pose little risk,\" Bloomberg\nreported\n. An investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and CrowdStrike is reportedly ongoing. This is the second breach the company has acknowledged to clients in recent weeks. The intrusion is assessed to be separate from\nanother hack\nat Oracle Health(formerly Cerner) that affected some U.S. healthcare customers last month. News about the breach came to light after an unidentified threat actor named \"rose87168\" attempted to sell data on BreachForums that they claimed to have stolen from the company's cloud servers. Multiple cybersecurity companies, including\nBlack Kite\n,\nCloudSEK\n,\nCyberAngel\n,\nHudson Rock\n,\nOrca Security\n,\nSOCRadar\n,\nSygnia\n, and\nTrustwave\n, have analyzed and validated the data posted for sale online as directly extracted from Oracle. The attacker is\nbelieved\nto have exploited an unpatched vulnerability in Oracle Fusion Middleware (CVE-2021-35587) to compromise Oracle Cloud's login and authentication system and steal the data. \"This exposure was facilitated via a 2020 Java exploit and the hacker was able to install a web shell along with malware,\" CyberAngel said. \"The malware specifically targeted the Oracle IDM database and was able to exfil data.\" Security researcher Kevin Beaumont\nsaid\n\"Oracle are attempting to wordsmith statements around Oracle Cloud and use very specific words to avoid responsibility,\" adding \"Oracle rebadged old Oracle Cloud services to be Oracle Classic. Oracle Classic has the security incident. Oracle are denying it on 'Oracle Cloud' by using this scope ‚Äî but it's still Oracle cloud services that Oracle manage. That's part of the wordplay.\" CloudSEK has\ndeveloped\nan online tool that allows organizations to check whether they are impacted by the data breach. Oracle's private acknowledgment also comes just days after the company was\nhit with a class action lawsuit\nover its handling of the security event.\nNew Triton RAT Emerges in the Wild\n‚Äî A new Python-based remote access trojan called\nTriton RAT\nallows threat actors to remotely access and control a system using Telegram. Written in Python, the malware is\npublicly available\non GitHub and comes with capabilities to log keystrokes, run commands, record screens, gather Wi-Fi information, and steal passwords, clipboard content, and Roblox security cookies. \"A Roblox security cookie is a browser cookie that stores the users' session and can be used to gain access to the Roblox account bypassing 2FA,\" Cado Security said. The disclosure comes as CYFIRMA\ndetailed\nanother RAT written in Python that uses Discord's API for command-and-control (C2) in order to execute arbitrary system commands, steal sensitive information, capture screenshots, and manipulate both local machines and Discord servers.\nU.S. DoJ Announces Recovery of $8.2M Stolen in Romance Baiting Scam\n‚Äî The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has\nannounced\nthe recovery of $8.2 million worth of USDT (Tether) that was stolen via a\nromance baiting\n(previously pig butchering) scam. According to a\ncomplaint\nfiled in late February 2025, the scam targeted a woman in Ohio, who lost her entire life savings of approximately $663,352, after she responded to a text message from an unknown number in November 2023. While the initial conversation revolved around topics such as hobbies and religion, the victim was persuaded into opening an account at crypto.com and transferred her money into the account. \"When the victim wanted to withdraw funds, her 'friend,' relented and said additional payments were needed and she complied,\" the DoJ said. \"When the victim no longer had any funds left after making additional payments, her 'friend' began to threaten her that he would send his friends to 'take care of' her friends and family.\" Over 30 victims are estimated to have fallen for the scheme in total.\"\nClickFix Used to Deliver QakBot\n‚Äî The increasingly popular\nClickFix\ntechnique has been used as a delivery vector to distribute the previously dormant\nQakBot\nmalware. The attack pairs the malware with ClickFix, an endpoint compromise method that was first observed towards the end of 2024 and has since gained significant traction in recent months. It involves tricking a victim into running a malicious command under the pretext of fixing an issue, typically a CAPTCHA verification challenge.\nFlaw Disclosed in Verizon Call Filter\n‚Äî Verizon's Call Filter app had a\nvulnerability\nthat allowed customers to access the incoming call logs for another Verizon Wireless number through an unsecured API request to the \"clr-aqx.cequintvzwecid.com/clr/callLogRetrieval\" endpoint. But security researcher Evan Connelly, who discovered and reported the bug on February 22, 2025, found that the request containing the phone number used to retrieve call history logs was not verified against the phone number whose incoming call logs were being requested. This could open the door to a scenario where an attacker could have altered the request with another Verizon phone to retrieve their incoming call history. The vulnerability has since been addressed by Verizon as of March 25, 2025.\nGitHub Unveils Updates to Advanced Security Platform\n‚Äî GitHub has\nannounced\nupdates to its Advanced Security platform after its secret scanning service detected over\n39 million leaked secrets\nin repositories last year. This includes a free, organization-wide secret scan to help teams identify and reduce exposure, as well as the availability of GitHub Secret Protection and a new\nsecret risk assessment tool\nthat aims to offer \"clear insights into your organization's exposure.\"\nNew Ubuntu Linux Security Bypasses Detailed\n‚Äî Three security bypasses have been\ndiscovered\nin Ubuntu Linux's unprivileged user namespace restrictions, which could enable a local attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in kernel components. The bypasses, which occur via\naa-exec, busybox, and LD_PRELOAD\n, permit attackers to create user namespaces with elevated privileges. \"These bypasses enable local attackers to create user namespaces with full administrative capabilities, which facilitate exploiting vulnerabilities in kernel components requiring powerful administrative privileges within a confined environment,\" Qualys said in a statement. \"It is important to note that these bypasses alone do not enable complete system takeover; however, they become dangerous when combined with other vulnerabilities, typically kernel-related.\" Ubuntu, which\nacknowledged\nthe issues, said it's working to \"implement further tightening rules in AppArmor.\"\nClassiscam Targets Central Asia\n‚Äî\nClassiscam\nis an automated scam-as-a-service operation that uses Telegram bots to create fake websites impersonating legitimate services in an attempt to deceive victims into sharing their financial details. The scam, also called\nTelekopye\n, essentially involves the fraudsters either posing as a buyer or a seller on online platforms to trick victims into transferring money for non-existent goods or services, or persuading the seller to use a delivery service for the transaction via a fake delivery website that seeks their financial information. These conversations happen over a messaging app like Telegram by claiming that \"it is easier to communicate.\" Group-IB's investigation has\nfound\nthat more than ten financial institutions in Uzbekistan, including prominent banks and payment systems, have been targeted by phishing schemes, which employ bogus sites impersonating the services to obtain their customers' banking credentials. One such team engaged in the fraudulent scheme is Namangun Team, which has primarily provided phishing services aimed at Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan since late November 2024, allowing its customers to create phishing pages on the fly using their Telegram bot.\nGoogle Partners with NVIDIA and HiddenLayer for a New Model Signing Library\n‚Äî Google, in collaboration with NVIDIA and HiddenLayer, has\nannounced\nthe release of a Python library called \"\nmodel-signing\n\" that offers developers a way to sign and verify machine learning (ML) models in an effort to bolster the security of the ML supply chain and safeguard against emerging threats like\nmodel\nand\ndata poisoning\n,\nprompt injection\n,\nprompt leaking\nand\nprompt evasion\n. \"Using digital signatures like those from Sigstore, we allow users to verify that the model used by the application is exactly the model that was created by the developers,\" the tech giant said. The development comes as Python officially standardized a lock file format as part of\nPEP 751\n. The new format, named pylock.toml, is a TOML-based format that records exact dependency versions, file hashes, and installation sources. The new standard \"brings Python in line with other ecosystems like JavaScript (package-lock.json), Rust (Cargo.lock), and Go (go.sum),\" Socket\nsaid\n. \"While the PEP doesn't address all supply chain threats (such as typosquatting, maintainer account compromise, and concealed payloads), it lays the groundwork for better auditing and tamper resistance.\"\nArcanum Trojan Distributed via Fortune-Telling Sites\n‚Äî A new trojan called\nArcanum\nis being distributed via websites dedicated to fortune-telling and esoteric practices, masquerading as a \"magic\" app for predicting the future. The app, while offering seemingly harmless functionality, connects to a remote server to deploy additional payloads, including the Autolycus. Hermes stealer, the Karma.Miner miner, and the Lysander.Scytale crypto-malware. The captured information is subsequently exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server. The emergence of the malware coincides with the discovery of a credit card skimmer malware codenamed\nRolandSkimmer\nthat targets e-commerce users in Bulgaria by means of a Windows shortcut (LNK) file distributed via ZIP archives. The LNK file then initiates a multi-step process that installs a malicious browser extension on web browsers to steal credit card information. \"The attackers employ carefully crafted JavaScript payloads, misleading manifest files, and obfuscated VBScripts to maintain persistence across sessions and evade detection,\" Fortinet said.\nIdentity-Based Attacks on the Rise\n‚Äî Attackers are relying heavily on credential-enabled access points to infiltrate networks and power their operations, rather than using more complex methods like exploiting vulnerabilities or deploying malware, according to Cisco Talos. Ransomware gangs, in particular, are known to use stolen-but-valid credentials procured from initial access brokers (IABs) as a means of initial access into corporate networks. IABs, in turn, leverage commercially-available\ninformation stealers\nlike\nLumma\nto capture users' credentials. This is also exacerbated by the fact that many users recycle passwords across multiple services, creating a \"ripple effect of risk\" when their credentials are stolen. Based on traffic observed between September and November 2024,\n41% of successful logins\nacross websites protected by Cloudflare involve compromised passwords, per the web infrastructure company. What's more, valid VPN credentials could be\nabused\nto gain unrestricted access to sensitive systems, often with elevated privileges that mirror those of legitimate employees or administrators. The use of legitimate credentials by threat actors entirely bypasses security barriers, giving them a \"direct path to infiltrate networks, steal data, and deploy ransomware undetected.\" \"Identity-based attacks are attractive to threat actors because they can allow an adversary to carry out a range of malicious operations, often with minimal effort or without meeting much resistance from a security standpoint,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"This is due in large part to the activity being difficult to detect because it emanates from seemingly legitimate user accounts.\" Data gathered by the company shows that Identity and access management (IAM) applications were most frequently targeted in MFA attacks, accounting for 24% of all attacks targeting multi-factor authentication (MFA).\nIran-linked OilRig Targets Iraqi Entities\n‚Äî The Iranian hacking group known as\nOilRig\n(aka APT34) has been attributed to a series of cyber attacks against Iraqi state entities since 2024 that involve the use of spear-phishing lures to deploy a backdoor that can execute commands, gather host information, and upload/download files. The backdoor makes use of HTTP and email for C2 communications. \"The former secretly sends control instructions based on the characteristic value of the body content, and the latter uses a large number of compromised Iraqi official government mailboxes for email communication,\" ThreatBook\nsaid\n.\nSecurity Flaws in PyTorch Lightning\n‚Äî Five deserialization vulnerabilities have been disclosed in PyTorch Lightning versions 2.4.0 and earlier that could be potentially exploited to execute malicious code when loading machine learning models from unknown or untrusted sources. \"These vulnerabilities arise from the unsafe use of torch.load(), which is used to deserialize model checkpoints, configurations, and sometimes metadata,\" the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC)\nsaid\n. \"A user could unknowingly load a malicious file from local or remote locations containing embedded code that executes within the system's context, potentially leading to full system compromise.\" CERT/CC said the issues remain unpatched, requiring that users verify the files to be loaded are from trusted sources and with valid signatures.\nRussian Firm Offers $4 Million for Telegram Exploits\n‚Äî Operation Zero, a Russian exploit acquisition firm, says it is willing to pay up to $4 million for full-chain exploits targeting the popular messaging service Telegram. In a post\nshared\non X, the zero-day vulnerability purchase platform said it will pay up to $500,000 for exploits that can achieve 1-click remote code execution (RCE) and $1.5 million for those that can be weaponized to achieve RCE sans any user interaction (i.e., zero-click). \"In the scope are exploits for Android, iOS, Windows. The prices are depending on limitations of zero-days and obtained privileges,\" Operation Zero said. Exploit brokers often either develop or acquire security vulnerabilities in popular operating systems and apps and then re-sell them for a higher price to clients of interest. For Operation Zero to single out Telegram makes sense, given that the messaging app is popular with users in both Russia and Ukraine. A Telegram spokesperson\ntold\nTechCrunch that the messaging platform has \"never been vulnerable\" to a zero-click exploit. The development comes as details emerged about a\nzero-day flaw\nin Telegram's macOS client that could be exploited to achieve RCE. Early last month, security researcher 0x6rss also disclosed an updated version of the\nEvilVideo\nflaw in Telegram (CVE-2024-7014), which bypasses existing mitigations via .HTM files. \"A file with an '.htm' extension is disguised as a video and sent via the Telegram API, and while the user expects a video, the JavaScript code inside the HTML is actually executed,\" the researcher\nsaid\n. The new exploit has been codenamed EvilLoader.\nWhat are the Most Common Passwords in RDP Attacks?\n‚Äî They are 123456, 1234, Password1, 12345, P@sswOrd, password, Password123, Welcome1, 12345678, and Aa123456, according to Specops, based on an analysis of 15 million passwords used to attack RDP ports. \"Attackers are on the lookout for exposed RDP servers as these can be easy targets for brute force attacks,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"Additionally, attackers may conduct password spraying attacks on RDP servers and try known breached credentials on exposed servers.\"\nüé• Expert Webinar\nShadow AI Is Already Inside Your Apps ‚Äî Learn How to Lock It Down\n‚Äî AI tools are flooding your environment ‚Äî and most security teams can't see half of them. Shadow AI is quietly connecting to critical systems like Salesforce, creating hidden risks that traditional defenses miss. Join Dvir Sasson, Director of Security Research at Reco, to uncover where AI threats are hiding inside your SaaS apps, real-world attack stories, and how leading teams are detecting and shutting down rogue AI before it causes real damage.\nSecure Every Step of the Identity Lifecycle ‚Äî Before Attackers Exploit It\n‚Äî Today's attackers are using AI-driven deepfakes and social engineering to bypass weak identity defenses. Securing the entire identity journey ‚Äî from enrollment to daily access to recovery ‚Äî is now essential. Join Beyond Identity and Nametag to learn how enterprises are blocking account takeovers, securing access with phishing-resistant MFA and device trust, and defending against AI threats with Deepfake Defense‚Ñ¢.\nüîß Cybersecurity Tools\nGoResolver\n‚Äî Golang malware is tough to reverse ‚Äî obfuscators like Garble hide critical functions. GoResolver, Volexity's open-source tool, uses control-flow graph similarity to recover hidden function names and reveal package structures automatically. Integrated with IDA Pro and Ghidra, it turns opaque binaries into readable code faster. Available now on GitHub.\nMatano\n‚Äî It is a serverless, cloud-native security data lake built for AWS, giving security teams full control over their logs without vendor lock-in. It normalizes unstructured security data in real time, integrates with 50+ sources out of the box, supports detections-as-code in Python, and transforms logs using powerful VRL scripting ‚Äî all stored in open formats like Apache Iceberg and ECS. Query your data with tools like Athena or Snowflake, write real-time detections, and cut SIEM costs while keeping ownership of your security analytics.\nüîí Tip of the Week\nDetecting Threats Early by Tracking First-Time Connections\n‚Äî Most attackers leave their first real clue not with malware, but when they log in for the first time ‚Äî from a new IP, device, or location. Catching \"first-time\" access events is one of the fastest ways to spot breaches early, before attackers blend into daily traffic. Focus on critical systems: VPNs, admin portals, cloud dashboards, and service accounts.\nYou can automate this easily with free tools like Wazuh (detects new devices and IPs), OSQuery (queries unknown endpoints), or Graylog (builds alerts for unfamiliar connections). More advanced setups like Microsoft Sentinel or CrowdStrike Falcon Free also offer \"first seen\" detection at scale. Simple rules ‚Äî like alerting when an admin account logs in from a new country or an unexpected device accesses sensitive data ‚Äî can trigger early alarms without waiting for malware signatures.\nPro Move: Baseline your \"known\" users, IPs, and devices, then flag anything new. Bonus points if you combine this with honeytokens (fake credentials) to catch intruders actively probing your network. Remember: attackers can steal credentials, bypass MFA, or hide malware ‚Äî but they can't fake never having connected before.\nConclusion\nIn cybersecurity, the threats that worry us most often aren't the loudest ‚Äî they're the ones we never see coming. A silent API flaw. A forgotten credential. A malware-laced package you installed last month without a second thought.\nThis week's stories are a reminder: real risk lives in the blind spots.\nStay curious. Stay skeptical. Your next breach won't knock first.\nFound this article interesting?  Follow us on\nTwitter\nÔÇô\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "After more than 25 years of mitigating risks, ensuring compliance, and building robust security programs for Fortune 500 companies, I've learned that\nlooking busy isn't the same as being secure.\nIt's an easy trap for busy cybersecurity leaders to fall into. We rely on metrics that tell a story of the tremendous efforts we're expending - how many vulnerabilities we patched, how fast we responded - but often vulnerability management metrics get associated with operational metrics because traditional approaches to measuring and implementing vulnerability management does not actually reduce risk. So, we resort to various ways of reporting on how many patches were applied under the traditional\n30/60/90-day patching method\n.\nI call these\nvanity metrics\n: numbers that look impressive in reports but lack real-world impact. They offer reassurance, but not insights. Meanwhile, threats continue to grow more sophisticated, and attackers exploit the blind spots we're not measuring. I've seen firsthand how this disconnect between measurement and meaning can leave organizations exposed.\nIn this article, I'll explain why vanity metrics are not enough to protect today's complex environments and why it's time to stop measuring\nactivity\nand start measuring\neffectiveness\n.\nDrill Down: What Are Vanity Metrics?\nVanity metrics are numbers that look good in a report but offer little strategic value. They're easy to track, simple to present, and are often used to demonstrate activity - but they don't usually reflect actual risk reduction. They typically fall into three main types:\nVolume metrics\n‚Äì These count things: patches applied, vulnerabilities discovered, scans completed. They create a sense of productivity but don't speak to business impact or risk relevance.\nTime-based metrics without risk context\n‚Äì Metrics like Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) or Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) can sound impressive. But without prioritization based on criticality, speed is just the \"how,\" not the \"what.\"\nCoverage metrics\n‚Äì Percentages like \"95% of assets scanned\" or \"90% of vulnerabilities patched\" give an illusion of control. But they ignore the question of which 5% were missed - and whether they're the ones that matter most.\nVanity metrics aren't inherently wrong - but they're dangerously incomplete. They track motion, not meaning. And if they're not tied to threat relevance or business-critical assets, they can quietly undermine your entire security strategy.\nVanity Metrics: More Harm than Good\nWhen vanity metrics dominate security reporting, they may do more harm than good. I've seen organizations burn through time and budget chasing numbers that looked great in executive briefings - while critical exposures were left untouched.\nWhat goes wrong when you rely on vanity metrics?\nMisallocated effort\n‚Äì Teams focus on what's easy to fix or what moves a metric, not what truly reduces risk. This creates a dangerous gap between what's\ndone\nand what\nneeds to be done\n.\nFalse confidence\n‚Äì Upward-trending charts can mislead leadership into believing the organization is secure. Without context - exploitability, attack paths - that belief is fragile and can be costly.\nBroken prioritization\n‚Äì Massive vulnerability lists without context cause fatigue. High-risk issues can easily get lost in the noise, and remediation can get delayed where it matters most.\nStrategic stagnation\n‚Äì When reporting rewards activity over impact, innovation slows. The program becomes reactive - always busy, but not always safer.\nI've seen breaches occur in environments full of glowing KPIs. The reason? Those KPIs weren't tied to reality. A metric that doesn't reflect actual business risk isn't just meaningless - it's dangerous.\nMoving to Meaningful Metrics\nIf vanity metrics tell us what's been done, meaningful metrics tell us\nwhat matters\n. They shift the focus from\nactivity\nto\nimpact\n- giving security teams and business leaders a shared understanding of actual risk.\nA meaningful metric starts with a clear formula:\nrisk = likelihood √ó impact\n. It doesn't just ask \"What vulnerabilities exist?\" - it asks \"Which of these can be exploited to reach our most critical assets, and what would the consequences be?\" To make the shift to meaningful metrics, consider anchoring your reporting around five key metrics:\nRisk score (tied to business impact)\n- A meaningful risk score weighs exploitability, asset criticality, and potential impact. It should evolve dynamically as exposures change or as threat intelligence shifts. This score helps leadership understand security in business terms - not how many vulnerabilities exist, but how close we are to a meaningful breach.\nCritical asset exposure (tracked over time)\n- Not all assets are equal. You need to know which of your business-critical systems are currently exposed - and how that exposure is trending. Are you reducing risk to your most important infrastructure, or just spinning cycles on low-impact fixes? Tracking this over time shows whether your security program is actually closing the right gaps.\nAttack path mapping\n- Vulnerabilities don't exist in isolation. Attackers chain together exposures - misconfigurations, overprivileged identities, unpatched CVEs - to reach high-value targets.\nMapping these paths\nshows you how an attacker could actually move through your environment. It helps prioritize not just individual issues, but how they work together to form a threat.\nExposure class breakdown\n- You need to understand what types of exposures are most prevalent - and most dangerous. Whether it's credential misuse, missing patches, open ports, or cloud misconfigurations, this breakdown informs both tactical response and strategic planning. If 60% of your risk stems from identity-based exposures, for example, that should shape your investment decisions.\nMean Time to Remediate (MTTR) for critical exposures\n- Average MTTR is a flawed metric. It gets dragged down by easy fixes and ignores the tough problems. What matters is how fast you're closing the exposures that actually put you at risk. MTTR for critical exposures - those tied to exploitable attack paths or crown-jewel assets - is what really defines operational effectiveness.\nTaken together and continuously updated, meaningful metrics give you more than a snapshot - they provide a living, contextual view of your threat exposure. They elevate security reporting from task tracking to strategic insight. And most importantly, they give both security teams and business leaders a common language for making risk-informed decisions.\nThe Bottom Line\nVanity metrics offer comfort. They fill dashboards, impress in boardrooms, and suggest progress. But in the real world - where threat actors don't care how many patches you applied last month - they offer little protection.\nReal security demands a shift from tracking what's easy to measure to focusing on what actually matters. That means embracing metrics grounded in business risk. And this is where frameworks like\nContinuous Threat Exposure Management\n(CTEM) come into play. CTEM gives organizations the structure to move from static vulnerability lists to dynamic, prioritized action. And the results are compelling - Gartner projects that by 2026, organizations implementing CTEM could reduce breaches by two-thirds.\nThe metrics you choose shape the conversations you have - and the ones you miss. Vanity metrics keep everyone comfortable. Meaningful metrics force harder questions, but they get you closer to the truth. Because you can't reduce risk if you're not measuring it properly.\nNote:\nThis article is expertly written by Jason Fruge, CISO in Residence at XM Cyber.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\nÔÇô\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

Crypto companies like Coinbase and Ledger, and bulk email providers such as Mailchimp, SendGrid, Hubspot, Mailgun, and Zoho are among the targeted crypto companies.\nThe activity is assessed to be distinct from two loosely aligned threat actors\nScattered Spider\nand\nCryptoChameleon\n, which are both part of a broader cybercrime ecosystem called\nThe Com\n. Some aspects of the campaign were previously disclosed by security researcher\nTroy Hunt\nand\nBleeping Computer\nlast month.\nThe attacks involve the threat actors setting up lookalike phishing pages for prominent CRM and bulk email companies, aiming to trick high-value targets into providing their credentials. Once the credentials are obtained, the adversaries proceed to create an API key to ensure persistence even if the stolen password is reset by its owner.\nIn the next phase, the operators export mailing lists likely using an automated tool and send spam from those compromised accounts. The post-CRM-compromise supply chain spam messages inform users that they need to set up a new Coinbase Wallet using the seed phrase embedded in the email.\nThe end goal of the attacks is to use the same recovery phrase to hijack the accounts and transfer funds from those wallets. The links to Scattered Spider and CryptoChameleon stem from the use of a domain (\"mailchimp-sso[.]com\") that has been previously identified as used by the former, as well as CryptoChameleon's historical targeting of Coinbase and Ledger.\nThat said, the\nphishing kit\nused by PoisonSeed does not share any similarity with those used by the other two threat clusters, raising the possibility that it's either a brand new phishing kit from CryptoChameleon or it's a different threat actor that just happens to use similar tradecraft.\nThe development comes as a Russian-speaking threat actor has been observed using phishing pages hosted on Cloudflare Pages.Dev and Workers.Dev to deliver malware that can remotely control infected Windows hosts. A\nprevious iteration\nof the campaign was found to have also distributed the StealC information stealer.\n\"This recent campaign leverages Cloudflare-branded phishing pages themed around DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown notices served across multiple domains,\" Hunt.io\nsaid\n.\n\"The lure abuses the\nms-search protocol\nto download a malicious LNK file disguised as a PDF via a double extension. Once executed, the malware checks in with an attacker-operated Telegram bot-sending the victim's IP address-before transitioning to\nPyramid C2\nto control the infected host.\"\nFound this article interesting?

These numbers are likely artificially inflated to give the extensions a sense of legitimacy and popularity to entice others to install them.\nExtensionTotal says it reported the malicious extensions to Microsoft, but they are still available at the time of writing.\nThe Discord-themed extension on VSCode Marketplace\nSource: BleepingComputer\nPowerShell code installs XMRig miner\nWhen installed and activated, the malicious extensions fetch a PowerShell script from an external source at 'https://asdf11[.]xyz/'¬†and execute it. When finished, it also installs the legitimate extension it is impersonating, so the infected user does not become suspicious.\nCode to download the PowerShell script\nSource: BleepingComputer\nThe malicious PowerShell script performs multiple functions, like disabling defenses, establishing persistence, escalating privileges, and eventually loading the cryptominer.\nFirst, it creates a scheduled task disguised as \"OnedriveStartup\" and injects a script in the Windows Registry to ensure the malware (Launcher.exe) runs at system startup.\nNext, it turns off critical Windows services like Windows Update and Update Medic and adds its working directory to Windows Defender's exclusion list to evade detection.\nIf the malware wasn't executed with admin rights, it mimics a system binary (ComputerDefaults.exe) and performs DLL hijacking using a malicious MLANG.dll to elevate privileges and execute the Launcher.exe payload.\nThe executable, which comes in base64-encoded form, is decoded by the PowerShell script to connect with a secondary server at myaunet[.]su to download and run XMRig, a Monero cryptocurrency miner.\nBleepingComputer discovered that the threat actor's remote server also has a /npm/ folder, potentially indicating the campaign is active on that package index as well. However, we have not been able to find the malicious files on the NPM platform.\nPresence of an NPM directory on the threat actor's server\nSource: BleepingComputer\nIf you have installed any of the nine extensions mentioned in the ExtensionTotal report, you should remove them immediately and then manually locate and delete the coin miner, scheduled tasks, registry key, and malware directory.\nBleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft about the nine extensions, and we will update this post with their response.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n¬©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nVSCode extensions with 9 million installs pulled over security risks\nVSCode extensions found downloading early-stage ransomware\nMicrosoft apologizes for removing VSCode extensions used by millions\nCracked Garry‚Äôs Mod, BeamNG.drive games infect gamers with miners\nMassJacker malware uses 778,000 wallets to steal cryptocurrency"

        "Date": "2025-04-07",
        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nAs PCI DSS 4.0.1 comes into force, it shows the power of industry collaboration in cybersecurity.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThe PCI DSS concentrates its regulations on ‚Äòwhat‚Äô rather than ‚Äòhow‚Äô but remains one of the best cybersecurity standards available. Using the new version 4.0.1 as the lens, we discuss the PCI success story.\nPCI DSS 4.0 was introduced in 2022. It was a major upgrade to the existing version 3.2.1. To allow time for both PCI and the regulated entities to understand and implement the necessary requirements, some of the proposals were marked as best practices and future dated.\n\n\n\nThe existing version 3.2.1 was retired on March 31, 2024. Version 4.0 became the only active version of DSS, but still had some concerns. These were discussed in November 2024 and rapidly rectified. On March 31, 2025, the corrected and active version became DSS 4.0.1.\n\n\n\nUniqueness of DSS\n\nMonica Landen, CISO at Diligent\nDSS is unusual if not unique among security regulations. ‚ÄúThe entire payment industry came together (card brands, banks, merchants, service providers, etc.) to confront a growing threat. It wasn‚Äôt regulators forcing action; it was the industry saying, ‚ÄòWe can fix this‚Äô,‚Äù explains Monica Landen, CISO at Diligent. ‚ÄúLong before data privacy or government regulations, PCI DSS proved that an industry led standard could drive real, tangible improvements in security. I would love to see more of this across other industries.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis explains the great strength of DSS. It is by industry for industry and contains no distraction from user security (beyond the users‚Äô right not to suffer from industry insecurity). When governments get involved in regulating for cybersecurity, they invariably try to marry strong business security with protecting user rights. These two concepts are not a natural fit. They‚Äôre like mismatched pieces of a jigsaw puzzle; and forcing them together leads to overcomplication.\n\n\n\nThe EU‚Äôs AI Act is an example of overcomplicated regulation. While ‚Äì in general ‚Äì US regulations tend to safeguard innovation and companies, the EU is heavily focused on user rights and protections: with requirements defined by bureaucrats rather than AI experts. As a result, nobody wins.\n\n\n\nOn March 28, 2025, Bart De Witte (founder of the Hippo AI Foundation and now CEO and founder at startup Isaree (building an operating system for medical AI) commented on LinkedIn: ‚ÄúThe EU Commission made it illegal to build AI startups.‚Äù He compares the cost of conforming to the AI Act with the funds available to startups and concludes that the ‚ÄòBrussels bureaucrats‚Äô have only ‚Äúcemented Big Tech‚Äôs monopoly (only they can afford this)‚Äù and have ‚Äúguaranteed Europe‚Äôs AI irrelevance‚Äù.\n\n\n\nThis will not happen when a regulation is defined by the industry it regulates rather than by bureaucratic impositions. This is the strength of PCI DSS.\n\n\n\nThe making of DSS 4.0.1\nDSS conformance is only required for companies involved in processing, storing or transmitting credit or debit card data. It nevertheless provides good security advice to all companies ‚Äì but since it does not (by design) try to impose security on or for the user, its use will not ensure compliance with government regulations such as GDPR and the AI Act.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nIt is useful, therefore, to consider the philosophy and approach taken by the PCI in formulating its DSS.\n\n\n\nThe making of 4.0.1 is more than usually complex. Version 4.0 became mandatory on March 31, 2024. But it received negative feedback about the template provided to the assessors around two of the major additions being introduced: specifically, 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 intended to reduce the risk of e-skimming attacks during e-commerce transactions. Adam Bush, MD at Schellman, says, ‚ÄúIt was too long. There was too much redundancy ‚Äì areas where we were checking boxes and basically confirming the same thing over and over again. We suggested a reformatting of the template.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAdam Bush, Managing Director at Schellman\nThe ‚Äòwe‚Äô in this instance was an E-commerce Guidance Task Force formed by PCI with expertise from PCI SSC staff, payment brand representatives, members of the Board of Advisors and Technical Advisory Board, the Global Executive Assessor Roundtable, (GEAR), and the Small Merchant Business Task Force. Bush is a member of GEAR.\n\n\n\nPCI took the advice and rapidly produced a new template, but because it was a change to the mandated version, they had to issue an errata version. This is what became mandatory for the regulated entities on March 31, 2025. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a significant change,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúIt was significant to the template, but not significant to the underlying controls and what‚Äôs required of everyone.‚Äù What it demonstrates, however, is the speed and efficiency with which a standard developed by the industry for the industry can correct its own weaknesses.¬†\n\n\n\nThe focus on securing the industry rather than the user can be seen by looking closer at 4.0.1‚Äôs treatment of three current and major security concerns: MFA, encryption, and AI.\n\n\n\nMFA\nMFA controls are not new, but have been extended. ‚ÄúPCI DSS 4.0.1 extends MFA beyond just administrators, to all accounts accessing cardholder data,‚Äù comments Piyush Pandey, CEO at Pathlock. ‚ÄúIt also requires secure MFA implementation and configuration.‚Äù\n\n\n\nLanden further explains, ‚ÄúMFA is now required for access to the cardholder data environment and not just for VPN or remote access.‚Äù She adds that she would like to see emphasis on ‚Äòphishing resistant‚Äô MFA.\n\n\n\nIn short, says Vini Merlin, product manager at Oasis Security, ‚ÄúMFA requirements have expanded beyond remote access to include all access to the cardholder data environment (CDE). Additionally, organizations must conduct regular PCI DSS scope access reviews to ensure proper access controls.‚Äù\n\n\n\nNot everyone is happy with the extent of the extensions. ‚ÄúMobile devices are commonly used in MFA workflows,‚Äù comments Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP product strategy at Zimperium. ‚ÄúThere are no explicit requirements asking the systems to ensure they do not send OTP to compromised mobile devices. Since most financial services are accessed through mobile apps, malware is quite common for stealing credentials. By not requiring ‚Äòdevice attestation‚Äô bad actors are able to steal credentials and OTPs, resulting in account takeovers and fraud.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSo, is not requiring phishing resistant MFA nor device attestation a failing in the PCI DSS regulation? Probably not, if you consider the PCI‚Äôs own mandate. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rather bold assumption to consider that a card user requires MFA to use a personal card,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúThe user of a card can be very risky over personal security. That user can leave cards in a wallet, lying on the table, on a seat on public transport.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIf a card is lost or stolen, no amount of MFA can prevent contactless card fraud or card not present fraud. But protecting personal cards is the responsibility of the users, not the PCI ‚Äì which has no authority over users. Their cards and their phones are their own personal property. PCI DSS, continues Bush, sets and enforces standards for the payment card industry: ‚Äúthe requirements are written for merchants once they are the holder or custodian of the users‚Äô credit card information.‚Äù There is no attempt to tell users what to do.\n\n\n\nWhile this explains the absence of device attestation as part of the MFA requirement, the avoidance of specifying a particular type of MFA to be used by the industry (such as phishing resistant) can be better understood by looking at the DSS rules on encryption.\n\n\n\nEncryption\nThe encryption requirements specified in 4.0.1 have been extended. ‚ÄúTo ensure secure data transmission, TLS 1.2 or higher is now required, while SSL and early TLS versions are strictly prohibited due to security vulnerabilities,‚Äù explains Merlin. ‚ÄúEncryption at rest is also strengthened ‚Äì if disk-level encryption is used, organizations must implement additional controls to ensure Primary Account Numbers (PANs) remain unreadable. Secure key management and strong cryptographic algorithms are essential for maintaining compliance.‚Äù¬†\n\n\n\nBut the basic encryption of data has not changed. It is simply a requirement for ‚Äòstrong encryption‚Äô, with no attempt to define what constitutes strong encryption. On the surface, this appears surprising since NIST has spent most of the last decade developing stronger encryption; and the NSA is insisting that, from 2017, US national security systems can only purchase new products that include these new NIST standardized encryption algorithms.\n\n\n\nHowever, traditionally, PCI tries not to be overly prescriptive. It defines what must be achieved rather than how it must be achieved. There are good reasons for this. What offered good security last week may not offer good security next week; and what is good for one company may not be so good for another. In encryption, a strong algorithm this week could become a weak algorithm overnight if it is cracked. But the requirement for strong encryption remains a valid requirement regardless of the state of individual algorithms.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an issue that has been evaluated by the council,‚Äù explains Bush. The value of specific security controls and systems can change rapidly, and it affects far more than encryption alone. ‚ÄúSo, DSS requires that regulated bodies constantly monitor their technology and security controls against what‚Äôs happening in the real world. Is what has been used for the last few years still adequate? Is the encryption being used still strong, or has it been broken. Is it time to change from AES 128 to AES 256? PCI solves this problem by putting the liability back on the implementors, while the assessors can say ‚Äòyes‚Äô this is adequate today, or ‚Äòno‚Äô this is no longer adequate.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe same basic principle applies to MFA. It is on the implementer to install MFA, and the assessor to judge the implementation, including whether the MFA in this instance should be phishing resistant MFA, if that hasn‚Äôt been implemented.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe use of artificial intelligence is a complex area that is only just being seriously integrated into DSS ‚Äì remember that the original 4.0 was released back in 2022, the same year that ChatGPT began upending the world as we know it. PCI was aware of AI, but more as a contained ML function within different security products. It had no real understanding of publicly available LLMs.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVersion 4.0.1 does not prescriptively add anything around AI,‚Äù says Bush, ‚Äúand the council has only just begun writing guidance on the use of AI.‚Äù Within the last month it published a document on how it could be used by assessors, such as Bush himself. It is reasonable to use AI on black or white assessments like finding open ports; but perhaps not reasonable to allow it to make judgmental calls on whether a control is or is not necessary.\n\n\n\nBut the council gives no definitive guidance on whether a merchant or service provider should be using AI. ‚ÄúI can tell you the attitude toward AI is ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing new‚Äô. This is still a machine that is referencing code that was written either by a human or by some other artificial intelligence,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still software running on a server somewhere. It‚Äôs still ones and zeros ‚Äì and we already have a secure framework that says how things should be operating.‚Äù\n\n\n\nWearing my Nostradamus hat, he adds, ‚ÄúI would suggest that the council is not going to issue anything hugely revelatory on how we should be assessing AI deployment in merchant environments. My guess is that it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äònothing new here‚Äô; we have a robust set of security controls and frameworks that AI also falls pretty squarely within.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAnd remember, by not regulating for the user, DSS can avoid getting bogged down in esoteric and subjective concerns over ethics.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, the only new requirement discusses the regulated entities‚Äô use of third-party AI implementations, and is more focused on vendor-related risks than AI per se. ‚ÄúWhile PCI DSS v4.0.1 does not explicitly regulate AI,‚Äù comments Merlin, ‚Äúorganizations must vet their AI vendors, ensuring these tools do not inadvertently store, process, or transmit card holder data outside of a controlled PCI DSS-compliant environment. AI-driven fraud detection, automation tools, and customer service platforms must be assessed for compliance risks to prevent unintentional data exposure.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation of the council‚Äôs traditional approach ‚Äì put liability for doing the right thing on the regulated entities, and then use the assessors to assess whether the actions are valid and conform to the spirit of the regulation.\n\n\n\nSummary¬†\n4.0.1 is a major new version of PCI DSS ‚Äì but it remains true to the council‚Äôs long standing principles. The correct way to secure one company might not be the correct way to secure another. For this reason, DSS primarily specifies required outcomes rather than precise methods of implementation. One requirement is that the regulated entities continually monitor the performance of their own security policies in achieving those outcomes, while the assessors are there to judge whether it is valid.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the standard remains strictly within its purview: by the industry for the industry. It has no remit on how users behave with their own payment cards and phones and cannot ‚Äì and consequently does not attempt ‚Äì to regulate user behavior.\n\n\n\nFor the industry itself, Landen comments, ‚ÄúThe implications come down to more effort and cost. For mature security organizations, this will not be a heavy lift. For less mature organizations, however, there will likely be an ongoing operational overhead including skilled people, process, and technology to comply with these new requirements.‚Äù\n\n\n\nDSS version 4.0.1 provides an excellent baseline or checklist for improving the security of companies. In this sense it is a huge benefit to cybersecurity. But it must be understood that complying with DSS does not imply compliance with the more bureaucratic regulations such as GDPR and the AI Act.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Cybersecurity Regulatory Mayhem\nRelated: The Hidden Cost of Compliance: When Regulations Weaken Security\nRelated: AI Regulation Gets Serious in 2025 ‚Äì Is Your Organization Ready?\nRelated: Supreme Court Ruling Threatens the Framework of Cybersecurity Regulation\n\nPCI DSS 4.0 was introduced in 2022.

Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nIt is useful, therefore, to consider the philosophy and approach taken by the PCI in formulating its DSS.\n\n\n\nThe making of 4.0.1 is more than usually complex. Version 4.0 became mandatory on March 31, 2024. But it received negative feedback about the template provided to the assessors around two of the major additions being introduced: specifically, 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 intended to reduce the risk of e-skimming attacks during e-commerce transactions. Adam Bush, MD at Schellman, says, ‚ÄúIt was too long. There was too much redundancy ‚Äì areas where we were checking boxes and basically confirming the same thing over and over again. We suggested a reformatting of the template.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAdam Bush, Managing Director at Schellman\nThe ‚Äòwe‚Äô in this instance was an E-commerce Guidance Task Force formed by PCI with expertise from PCI SSC staff, payment brand representatives, members of the Board of Advisors and Technical Advisory Board, the Global Executive Assessor Roundtable, (GEAR), and the Small Merchant Business Task Force. Bush is a member of GEAR.\n\n\n\nPCI took the advice and rapidly produced a new template, but because it was a change to the mandated version, they had to issue an errata version. This is what became mandatory for the regulated entities on March 31, 2025. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a significant change,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúIt was significant to the template, but not significant to the underlying controls and what‚Äôs required of everyone.‚Äù What it demonstrates, however, is the speed and efficiency with which a standard developed by the industry for the industry can correct its own weaknesses.¬†\n\n\n\nThe focus on securing the industry rather than the user can be seen by looking closer at 4.0.1‚Äôs treatment of three current and major security concerns: MFA, encryption, and AI.\n\n\n\nMFA\nMFA controls are not new, but have been extended. ‚ÄúPCI DSS 4.0.1 extends MFA beyond just administrators, to all accounts accessing cardholder data,‚Äù comments Piyush Pandey, CEO at Pathlock. ‚ÄúIt also requires secure MFA implementation and configuration.‚Äù\n\n\n\nLanden further explains, ‚ÄúMFA is now required for access to the cardholder data environment and not just for VPN or remote access.‚Äù She adds that she would like to see emphasis on ‚Äòphishing resistant‚Äô MFA.\n\n\n\nIn short, says Vini Merlin, product manager at Oasis Security, ‚ÄúMFA requirements have expanded beyond remote access to include all access to the cardholder data environment (CDE). Additionally, organizations must conduct regular PCI DSS scope access reviews to ensure proper access controls.‚Äù\n\n\n\nNot everyone is happy with the extent of the extensions. ‚ÄúMobile devices are commonly used in MFA workflows,‚Äù comments Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP product strategy at Zimperium. ‚ÄúThere are no explicit requirements asking the systems to ensure they do not send OTP to compromised mobile devices. Since most financial services are accessed through mobile apps, malware is quite common for stealing credentials. By not requiring ‚Äòdevice attestation‚Äô bad actors are able to steal credentials and OTPs, resulting in account takeovers and fraud.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSo, is not requiring phishing resistant MFA nor device attestation a failing in the PCI DSS regulation? Probably not, if you consider the PCI‚Äôs own mandate. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rather bold assumption to consider that a card user requires MFA to use a personal card,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúThe user of a card can be very risky over personal security. That user can leave cards in a wallet, lying on the table, on a seat on public transport.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIf a card is lost or stolen, no amount of MFA can prevent contactless card fraud or card not present fraud. But protecting personal cards is the responsibility of the users, not the PCI ‚Äì which has no authority over users. Their cards and their phones are their own personal property. PCI DSS, continues Bush, sets and enforces standards for the payment card industry: ‚Äúthe requirements are written for merchants once they are the holder or custodian of the users‚Äô credit card information.‚Äù There is no attempt to tell users what to do.\n\n\n\nWhile this explains the absence of device attestation as part of the MFA requirement, the avoidance of specifying a particular type of MFA to be used by the industry (such as phishing resistant) can be better understood by looking at the DSS rules on encryption.\n\n\n\nEncryption\nThe encryption requirements specified in 4.0.1 have been extended. ‚ÄúTo ensure secure data transmission, TLS 1.2 or higher is now required, while SSL and early TLS versions are strictly prohibited due to security vulnerabilities,‚Äù explains Merlin. ‚ÄúEncryption at rest is also strengthened ‚Äì if disk-level encryption is used, organizations must implement additional controls to ensure Primary Account Numbers (PANs) remain unreadable. Secure key management and strong cryptographic algorithms are essential for maintaining compliance.‚Äù¬†\n\n\n\nBut the basic encryption of data has not changed. It is simply a requirement for ‚Äòstrong encryption‚Äô, with no attempt to define what constitutes strong encryption. On the surface, this appears surprising since NIST has spent most of the last decade developing stronger encryption; and the NSA is insisting that, from 2017, US national security systems can only purchase new products that include these new NIST standardized encryption algorithms.\n\n\n\nHowever, traditionally, PCI tries not to be overly prescriptive. It defines what must be achieved rather than how it must be achieved. There are good reasons for this. What offered good security last week may not offer good security next week; and what is good for one company may not be so good for another. In encryption, a strong algorithm this week could become a weak algorithm overnight if it is cracked. But the requirement for strong encryption remains a valid requirement regardless of the state of individual algorithms.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an issue that has been evaluated by the council,‚Äù explains Bush. The value of specific security controls and systems can change rapidly, and it affects far more than encryption alone. ‚ÄúSo, DSS requires that regulated bodies constantly monitor their technology and security controls against what‚Äôs happening in the real world. Is what has been used for the last few years still adequate? Is the encryption being used still strong, or has it been broken. Is it time to change from AES 128 to AES 256? PCI solves this problem by putting the liability back on the implementors, while the assessors can say ‚Äòyes‚Äô this is adequate today, or ‚Äòno‚Äô this is no longer adequate.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe same basic principle applies to MFA. It is on the implementer to install MFA, and the assessor to judge the implementation, including whether the MFA in this instance should be phishing resistant MFA, if that hasn‚Äôt been implemented.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe use of artificial intelligence is a complex area that is only just being seriously integrated into DSS ‚Äì remember that the original 4.0 was released back in 2022, the same year that ChatGPT began upending the world as we know it. PCI was aware of AI, but more as a contained ML function within different security products. It had no real understanding of publicly available LLMs.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVersion 4.0.1 does not prescriptively add anything around AI,‚Äù says Bush, ‚Äúand the council has only just begun writing guidance on the use of AI.‚Äù Within the last month it published a document on how it could be used by assessors, such as Bush himself. It is reasonable to use AI on black or white assessments like finding open ports; but perhaps not reasonable to allow it to make judgmental calls on whether a control is or is not necessary.\n\n\n\nBut the council gives no definitive guidance on whether a merchant or service provider should be using AI. ‚ÄúI can tell you the attitude toward AI is ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing new‚Äô. This is still a machine that is referencing code that was written either by a human or by some other artificial intelligence,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still software running on a server somewhere. It‚Äôs still ones and zeros ‚Äì and we already have a secure framework that says how things should be operating.‚Äù\n\n\n\nWearing my Nostradamus hat, he adds, ‚ÄúI would suggest that the council is not going to issue anything hugely revelatory on how we should be assessing AI deployment in merchant environments. My guess is that it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äònothing new here‚Äô; we have a robust set of security controls and frameworks that AI also falls pretty squarely within.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAnd remember, by not regulating for the user, DSS can avoid getting bogged down in esoteric and subjective concerns over ethics.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, the only new requirement discusses the regulated entities‚Äô use of third-party AI implementations, and is more focused on vendor-related risks than AI per se. ‚ÄúWhile PCI DSS v4.0.1 does not explicitly regulate AI,‚Äù comments Merlin, ‚Äúorganizations must vet their AI vendors, ensuring these tools do not inadvertently store, process, or transmit card holder data outside of a controlled PCI DSS-compliant environment. AI-driven fraud detection, automation tools, and customer service platforms must be assessed for compliance risks to prevent unintentional data exposure.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation of the council‚Äôs traditional approach ‚Äì put liability for doing the right thing on the regulated entities, and then use the assessors to assess whether the actions are valid and conform to the spirit of the regulation.\n\n\n\nSummary¬†\n4.0.1 is a major new version of PCI DSS ‚Äì but it remains true to the council‚Äôs long standing principles. The correct way to secure one company might not be the correct way to secure another. For this reason, DSS primarily specifies required outcomes rather than precise methods of implementation. One requirement is that the regulated entities continually monitor the performance of their own security policies in achieving those outcomes, while the assessors are there to judge whether it is valid.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the standard remains strictly within its purview: by the industry for the industry. It has no remit on how users behave with their own payment cards and phones and cannot ‚Äì and consequently does not attempt ‚Äì to regulate user behavior.\n\n\n\nFor the industry itself, Landen comments, ‚ÄúThe implications come down to more effort and cost. For mature security organizations, this will not be a heavy lift. For less mature organizations, however, there will likely be an ongoing operational overhead including skilled people, process, and technology to comply with these new requirements.‚Äù\n\n\n\nDSS version 4.0.1 provides an excellent baseline or checklist for improving the security of companies. In this sense it is a huge benefit to cybersecurity. But it must be understood that complying with DSS does not imply compliance with the more bureaucratic regulations such as GDPR and the AI Act.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Cybersecurity Regulatory Mayhem\nRelated: The Hidden Cost of Compliance: When Regulations Weaken Security\nRelated: AI Regulation Gets Serious in 2025 ‚Äì Is Your Organization Ready?\nRelated: Supreme Court Ruling Threatens the Framework of Cybersecurity Regulation\n\nThe existing version 3.2.1 was retired on March 31, 2024. Version 4.0 became the only active version of DSS, but still had some concerns. These were discussed in November 2024 and rapidly rectified. On March 31, 2025, the corrected and active version became DSS 4.0.1.\n\n\n\nUniqueness of DSS\n\nMonica Landen, CISO at Diligent\nDSS is unusual if not unique among security regulations. ‚ÄúThe entire payment industry came together (card brands, banks, merchants, service providers, etc.) to confront a growing threat. It wasn‚Äôt regulators forcing action; it was the industry saying, ‚ÄòWe can fix this‚Äô,‚Äù explains Monica Landen, CISO at Diligent. ‚ÄúLong before data privacy or government regulations, PCI DSS proved that an industry led standard could drive real, tangible improvements in security. I would love to see more of this across other industries.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis explains the great strength of DSS. It is by industry for industry and contains no distraction from user security (beyond the users‚Äô right not to suffer from industry insecurity). When governments get involved in regulating for cybersecurity, they invariably try to marry strong business security with protecting user rights. These two concepts are not a natural fit. They‚Äôre like mismatched pieces of a jigsaw puzzle; and forcing them together leads to overcomplication.\n\n\n\nThe EU‚Äôs AI Act is an example of overcomplicated regulation.

PCI DSS, continues Bush, sets and enforces standards for the payment card industry: ‚Äúthe requirements are written for merchants once they are the holder or custodian of the users‚Äô credit card information.‚Äù There is no attempt to tell users what to do.\n\n\n\nWhile this explains the absence of device attestation as part of the MFA requirement, the avoidance of specifying a particular type of MFA to be used by the industry (such as phishing resistant) can be better understood by looking at the DSS rules on encryption.\n\n\n\nEncryption\nThe encryption requirements specified in 4.0.1 have been extended. ‚ÄúTo ensure secure data transmission, TLS 1.2 or higher is now required, while SSL and early TLS versions are strictly prohibited due to security vulnerabilities,‚Äù explains Merlin. ‚ÄúEncryption at rest is also strengthened ‚Äì if disk-level encryption is used, organizations must implement additional controls to ensure Primary Account Numbers (PANs) remain unreadable. Secure key management and strong cryptographic algorithms are essential for maintaining compliance.‚Äù¬†\n\n\n\nBut the basic encryption of data has not changed. It is simply a requirement for ‚Äòstrong encryption‚Äô, with no attempt to define what constitutes strong encryption. On the surface, this appears surprising since NIST has spent most of the last decade developing stronger encryption; and the NSA is insisting that, from 2017, US national security systems can only purchase new products that include these new NIST standardized encryption algorithms.\n\n\n\nHowever, traditionally, PCI tries not to be overly prescriptive. It defines what must be achieved rather than how it must be achieved. There are good reasons for this. What offered good security last week may not offer good security next week; and what is good for one company may not be so good for another. In encryption, a strong algorithm this week could become a weak algorithm overnight if it is cracked. But the requirement for strong encryption remains a valid requirement regardless of the state of individual algorithms.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an issue that has been evaluated by the council,‚Äù explains Bush. The value of specific security controls and systems can change rapidly, and it affects far more than encryption alone. ‚ÄúSo, DSS requires that regulated bodies constantly monitor their technology and security controls against what‚Äôs happening in the real world. Is what has been used for the last few years still adequate? Is the encryption being used still strong, or has it been broken. Is it time to change from AES 128 to AES 256? PCI solves this problem by putting the liability back on the implementors, while the assessors can say ‚Äòyes‚Äô this is adequate today, or ‚Äòno‚Äô this is no longer adequate.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe same basic principle applies to MFA. It is on the implementer to install MFA, and the assessor to judge the implementation, including whether the MFA in this instance should be phishing resistant MFA, if that hasn‚Äôt been implemented.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe use of artificial intelligence is a complex area that is only just being seriously integrated into DSS ‚Äì remember that the original 4.0 was released back in 2022, the same year that ChatGPT began upending the world as we know it. PCI was aware of AI, but more as a contained ML function within different security products. It had no real understanding of publicly available LLMs.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVersion 4.0.1 does not prescriptively add anything around AI,‚Äù says Bush, ‚Äúand the council has only just begun writing guidance on the use of AI.‚Äù Within the last month it published a document on how it could be used by assessors, such as Bush himself. It is reasonable to use AI on black or white assessments like finding open ports; but perhaps not reasonable to allow it to make judgmental calls on whether a control is or is not necessary.\n\n\n\nBut the council gives no definitive guidance on whether a merchant or service provider should be using AI. ‚ÄúI can tell you the attitude toward AI is ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing new‚Äô. This is still a machine that is referencing code that was written either by a human or by some other artificial intelligence,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still software running on a server somewhere.

My guess is that it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äònothing new here‚Äô; we have a robust set of security controls and frameworks that AI also falls pretty squarely within.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAnd remember, by not regulating for the user, DSS can avoid getting bogged down in esoteric and subjective concerns over ethics.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, the only new requirement discusses the regulated entities‚Äô use of third-party AI implementations, and is more focused on vendor-related risks than AI per se. ‚ÄúWhile PCI DSS v4.0.1 does not explicitly regulate AI,‚Äù comments Merlin, ‚Äúorganizations must vet their AI vendors, ensuring these tools do not inadvertently store, process, or transmit card holder data outside of a controlled PCI DSS-compliant environment. AI-driven fraud detection, automation tools, and customer service platforms must be assessed for compliance risks to prevent unintentional data exposure.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation of the council‚Äôs traditional approach ‚Äì put liability for doing the right thing on the regulated entities, and then use the assessors to assess whether the actions are valid and conform to the spirit of the regulation.\n\n\n\nSummary¬†\n4.0.1 is a major new version of PCI DSS ‚Äì but it remains true to the council‚Äôs long standing principles. The correct way to secure one company might not be the correct way to secure another. For this reason, DSS primarily specifies required outcomes rather than precise methods of implementation. One requirement is that the regulated entities continually monitor the performance of their own security policies in achieving those outcomes, while the assessors are there to judge whether it is valid.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the standard remains strictly within its purview: by the industry for the industry. It has no remit on how users behave with their own payment cards and phones and cannot ‚Äì and consequently does not attempt ‚Äì to regulate user behavior.\n\n\n\nFor the industry itself, Landen comments, ‚ÄúThe implications come down to more effort and cost. For mature security organizations, this will not be a heavy lift. For less mature organizations, however, there will likely be an ongoing operational overhead including skilled people, process, and technology to comply with these new requirements.‚Äù\n\n\n\nDSS version 4.0.1 provides an excellent baseline or checklist for improving the security of companies.

It is by industry for industry and contains no distraction from user security (beyond the users‚Äô right not to suffer from industry insecurity). When governments get involved in regulating for cybersecurity, they invariably try to marry strong business security with protecting user rights. These two concepts are not a natural fit. They‚Äôre like mismatched pieces of a jigsaw puzzle; and forcing them together leads to overcomplication.\n\n\n\nThe EU‚Äôs AI Act is an example of overcomplicated regulation.

But it received negative feedback about the template provided to the assessors around two of the major additions being introduced: specifically, 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 intended to reduce the risk of e-skimming attacks during e-commerce transactions. Adam Bush, MD at Schellman, says, ‚ÄúIt was too long. There was too much redundancy ‚Äì areas where we were checking boxes and basically confirming the same thing over and over again. We suggested a reformatting of the template.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAdam Bush, Managing Director at Schellman\nThe ‚Äòwe‚Äô in this instance was an E-commerce Guidance Task Force formed by PCI with expertise from PCI SSC staff, payment brand representatives, members of the Board of Advisors and Technical Advisory Board, the Global Executive Assessor Roundtable, (GEAR), and the Small Merchant Business Task Force. Bush is a member of GEAR.\n\n\n\nPCI took the advice and rapidly produced a new template, but because it was a change to the mandated version, they had to issue an errata version. This is what became mandatory for the regulated entities on March 31, 2025. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a significant change,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúIt was significant to the template, but not significant to the underlying controls and what‚Äôs required of everyone.‚Äù What it demonstrates, however, is the speed and efficiency with which a standard developed by the industry for the industry can correct its own weaknesses.¬†\n\n\n\nThe focus on securing the industry rather than the user can be seen by looking closer at 4.0.1‚Äôs treatment of three current and major security concerns: MFA, encryption, and AI.\n\n\n\nMFA\nMFA controls are not new, but have been extended. ‚ÄúPCI DSS 4.0.1 extends MFA beyond just administrators, to all accounts accessing cardholder data,‚Äù comments Piyush Pandey, CEO at Pathlock. ‚ÄúIt also requires secure MFA implementation and configuration.‚Äù\n\n\n\nLanden further explains, ‚ÄúMFA is now required for access to the cardholder data environment and not just for VPN or remote access.‚Äù She adds that she would like to see emphasis on ‚Äòphishing resistant‚Äô MFA.\n\n\n\nIn short, says Vini Merlin, product manager at Oasis Security, ‚ÄúMFA requirements have expanded beyond remote access to include all access to the cardholder data environment (CDE). Additionally, organizations must conduct regular PCI DSS scope access reviews to ensure proper access controls.‚Äù\n\n\n\nNot everyone is happy with the extent of the extensions. ‚ÄúMobile devices are commonly used in MFA workflows,‚Äù comments Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP product strategy at Zimperium. ‚ÄúThere are no explicit requirements asking the systems to ensure they do not send OTP to compromised mobile devices.

Version 4.0 became mandatory on March 31, 2024. But it received negative feedback about the template provided to the assessors around two of the major additions being introduced: specifically, 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 intended to reduce the risk of e-skimming attacks during e-commerce transactions. Adam Bush, MD at Schellman, says, ‚ÄúIt was too long. There was too much redundancy ‚Äì areas where we were checking boxes and basically confirming the same thing over and over again. We suggested a reformatting of the template.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAdam Bush, Managing Director at Schellman\nThe ‚Äòwe‚Äô in this instance was an E-commerce Guidance Task Force formed by PCI with expertise from PCI SSC staff, payment brand representatives, members of the Board of Advisors and Technical Advisory Board, the Global Executive Assessor Roundtable, (GEAR), and the Small Merchant Business Task Force. Bush is a member of GEAR.\n\n\n\nPCI took the advice and rapidly produced a new template, but because it was a change to the mandated version, they had to issue an errata version. This is what became mandatory for the regulated entities on March 31, 2025. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a significant change,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúIt was significant to the template, but not significant to the underlying controls and what‚Äôs required of everyone.‚Äù What it demonstrates, however, is the speed and efficiency with which a standard developed by the industry for the industry can correct its own weaknesses.¬†\n\n\n\nThe focus on securing the industry rather than the user can be seen by looking closer at 4.0.1‚Äôs treatment of three current and major security concerns: MFA, encryption, and AI.\n\n\n\nMFA\nMFA controls are not new, but have been extended. ‚ÄúPCI DSS 4.0.1 extends MFA beyond just administrators, to all accounts accessing cardholder data,‚Äù comments Piyush Pandey, CEO at Pathlock. ‚ÄúIt also requires secure MFA implementation and configuration.‚Äù\n\n\n\nLanden further explains, ‚ÄúMFA is now required for access to the cardholder data environment and not just for VPN or remote access.‚Äù She adds that she would like to see emphasis on ‚Äòphishing resistant‚Äô MFA.\n\n\n\nIn short, says Vini Merlin, product manager at Oasis Security, ‚ÄúMFA requirements have expanded beyond remote access to include all access to the cardholder data environment (CDE). Additionally, organizations must conduct regular PCI DSS scope access reviews to ensure proper access controls.‚Äù\n\n\n\nNot everyone is happy with the extent of the extensions. ‚ÄúMobile devices are commonly used in MFA workflows,‚Äù comments Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP product strategy at Zimperium. ‚ÄúThere are no explicit requirements asking the systems to ensure they do not send OTP to compromised mobile devices. Since most financial services are accessed through mobile apps, malware is quite common for stealing credentials. By not requiring ‚Äòdevice attestation‚Äô bad actors are able to steal credentials and OTPs, resulting in account takeovers and fraud.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSo, is not requiring phishing resistant MFA nor device attestation a failing in the PCI DSS regulation? Probably not, if you consider the PCI‚Äôs own mandate. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rather bold assumption to consider that a card user requires MFA to use a personal card,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúThe user of a card can be very risky over personal security. That user can leave cards in a wallet, lying on the table, on a seat on public transport.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIf a card is lost or stolen, no amount of MFA can prevent contactless card fraud or card not present fraud. But protecting personal cards is the responsibility of the users, not the PCI ‚Äì which has no authority over users. Their cards and their phones are their own personal property. PCI DSS, continues Bush, sets and enforces standards for the payment card industry: ‚Äúthe requirements are written for merchants once they are the holder or custodian of the users‚Äô credit card information.‚Äù There is no attempt to tell users what to do.\n\n\n\nWhile this explains the absence of device attestation as part of the MFA requirement, the avoidance of specifying a particular type of MFA to be used by the industry (such as phishing resistant) can be better understood by looking at the DSS rules on encryption.\n\n\n\nEncryption\nThe encryption requirements specified in 4.0.1 have been extended. ‚ÄúTo ensure secure data transmission, TLS 1.2 or higher is now required, while SSL and early TLS versions are strictly prohibited due to security vulnerabilities,‚Äù explains Merlin. ‚ÄúEncryption at rest is also strengthened ‚Äì if disk-level encryption is used, organizations must implement additional controls to ensure Primary Account Numbers (PANs) remain unreadable. Secure key management and strong cryptographic algorithms are essential for maintaining compliance.‚Äù¬†\n\n\n\nBut the basic encryption of data has not changed. It is simply a requirement for ‚Äòstrong encryption‚Äô, with no attempt to define what constitutes strong encryption. On the surface, this appears surprising since NIST has spent most of the last decade developing stronger encryption; and the NSA is insisting that, from 2017, US national security systems can only purchase new products that include these new NIST standardized encryption algorithms.\n\n\n\nHowever, traditionally, PCI tries not to be overly prescriptive. It defines what must be achieved rather than how it must be achieved. There are good reasons for this. What offered good security last week may not offer good security next week; and what is good for one company may not be so good for another. In encryption, a strong algorithm this week could become a weak algorithm overnight if it is cracked. But the requirement for strong encryption remains a valid requirement regardless of the state of individual algorithms.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an issue that has been evaluated by the council,‚Äù explains Bush. The value of specific security controls and systems can change rapidly, and it affects far more than encryption alone. ‚ÄúSo, DSS requires that regulated bodies constantly monitor their technology and security controls against what‚Äôs happening in the real world. Is what has been used for the last few years still adequate? Is the encryption being used still strong, or has it been broken. Is it time to change from AES 128 to AES 256? PCI solves this problem by putting the liability back on the implementors, while the assessors can say ‚Äòyes‚Äô this is adequate today, or ‚Äòno‚Äô this is no longer adequate.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe same basic principle applies to MFA. It is on the implementer to install MFA, and the assessor to judge the implementation, including whether the MFA in this instance should be phishing resistant MFA, if that hasn‚Äôt been implemented.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe use of artificial intelligence is a complex area that is only just being seriously integrated into DSS ‚Äì remember that the original 4.0 was released back in 2022, the same year that ChatGPT began upending the world as we know it. PCI was aware of AI, but more as a contained ML function within different security products. It had no real understanding of publicly available LLMs.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVersion 4.0.1 does not prescriptively add anything around AI,‚Äù says Bush, ‚Äúand the council has only just begun writing guidance on the use of AI.‚Äù Within the last month it published a document on how it could be used by assessors, such as Bush himself. It is reasonable to use AI on black or white assessments like finding open ports; but perhaps not reasonable to allow it to make judgmental calls on whether a control is or is not necessary.\n\n\n\nBut the council gives no definitive guidance on whether a merchant or service provider should be using AI. ‚ÄúI can tell you the attitude toward AI is ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing new‚Äô. This is still a machine that is referencing code that was written either by a human or by some other artificial intelligence,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still software running on a server somewhere. It‚Äôs still ones and zeros ‚Äì and we already have a secure framework that says how things should be operating.‚Äù\n\n\n\nWearing my Nostradamus hat, he adds, ‚ÄúI would suggest that the council is not going to issue anything hugely revelatory on how we should be assessing AI deployment in merchant environments. My guess is that it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äònothing new here‚Äô; we have a robust set of security controls and frameworks that AI also falls pretty squarely within.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAnd remember, by not regulating for the user, DSS can avoid getting bogged down in esoteric and subjective concerns over ethics.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, the only new requirement discusses the regulated entities‚Äô use of third-party AI implementations, and is more focused on vendor-related risks than AI per se. ‚ÄúWhile PCI DSS v4.0.1 does not explicitly regulate AI,‚Äù comments Merlin, ‚Äúorganizations must vet their AI vendors, ensuring these tools do not inadvertently store, process, or transmit card holder data outside of a controlled PCI DSS-compliant environment. AI-driven fraud detection, automation tools, and customer service platforms must be assessed for compliance risks to prevent unintentional data exposure.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation of the council‚Äôs traditional approach ‚Äì put liability for doing the right thing on the regulated entities, and then use the assessors to assess whether the actions are valid and conform to the spirit of the regulation.\n\n\n\nSummary¬†\n4.0.1 is a major new version of PCI DSS ‚Äì but it remains true to the council‚Äôs long standing principles. The correct way to secure one company might not be the correct way to secure another. For this reason, DSS primarily specifies required outcomes rather than precise methods of implementation. One requirement is that the regulated entities continually monitor the performance of their own security policies in achieving those outcomes, while the assessors are there to judge whether it is valid.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the standard remains strictly within its purview: by the industry for the industry. It has no remit on how users behave with their own payment cards and phones and cannot ‚Äì and consequently does not attempt ‚Äì to regulate user behavior.\n\n\n\nFor the industry itself, Landen comments, ‚ÄúThe implications come down to more effort and cost. For mature security organizations, this will not be a heavy lift. For less mature organizations, however, there will likely be an ongoing operational overhead including skilled people, process, and technology to comply with these new requirements.‚Äù\n\n\n\nDSS version 4.0.1 provides an excellent baseline or checklist for improving the security of companies.

Version 4.0 became mandatory on March 31, 2024. But it received negative feedback about the template provided to the assessors around two of the major additions being introduced: specifically, 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 intended to reduce the risk of e-skimming attacks during e-commerce transactions. Adam Bush, MD at Schellman, says, ‚ÄúIt was too long. There was too much redundancy ‚Äì areas where we were checking boxes and basically confirming the same thing over and over again. We suggested a reformatting of the template.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAdam Bush, Managing Director at Schellman\nThe ‚Äòwe‚Äô in this instance was an E-commerce Guidance Task Force formed by PCI with expertise from PCI SSC staff, payment brand representatives, members of the Board of Advisors and Technical Advisory Board, the Global Executive Assessor Roundtable, (GEAR), and the Small Merchant Business Task Force. Bush is a member of GEAR.\n\n\n\nPCI took the advice and rapidly produced a new template, but because it was a change to the mandated version, they had to issue an errata version. This is what became mandatory for the regulated entities on March 31, 2025. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a significant change,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúIt was significant to the template, but not significant to the underlying controls and what‚Äôs required of everyone.‚Äù What it demonstrates, however, is the speed and efficiency with which a standard developed by the industry for the industry can correct its own weaknesses.¬†\n\n\n\nThe focus on securing the industry rather than the user can be seen by looking closer at 4.0.1‚Äôs treatment of three current and major security concerns: MFA, encryption, and AI.\n\n\n\nMFA\nMFA controls are not new, but have been extended. ‚ÄúPCI DSS 4.0.1 extends MFA beyond just administrators, to all accounts accessing cardholder data,‚Äù comments Piyush Pandey, CEO at Pathlock. ‚ÄúIt also requires secure MFA implementation and configuration.‚Äù\n\n\n\nLanden further explains, ‚ÄúMFA is now required for access to the cardholder data environment and not just for VPN or remote access.‚Äù She adds that she would like to see emphasis on ‚Äòphishing resistant‚Äô MFA.\n\n\n\nIn short, says Vini Merlin, product manager at Oasis Security, ‚ÄúMFA requirements have expanded beyond remote access to include all access to the cardholder data environment (CDE). Additionally, organizations must conduct regular PCI DSS scope access reviews to ensure proper access controls.‚Äù\n\n\n\nNot everyone is happy with the extent of the extensions. ‚ÄúMobile devices are commonly used in MFA workflows,‚Äù comments Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP product strategy at Zimperium. ‚ÄúThere are no explicit requirements asking the systems to ensure they do not send OTP to compromised mobile devices. Since most financial services are accessed through mobile apps, malware is quite common for stealing credentials. By not requiring ‚Äòdevice attestation‚Äô bad actors are able to steal credentials and OTPs, resulting in account takeovers and fraud.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSo, is not requiring phishing resistant MFA nor device attestation a failing in the PCI DSS regulation? Probably not, if you consider the PCI‚Äôs own mandate. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rather bold assumption to consider that a card user requires MFA to use a personal card,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúThe user of a card can be very risky over personal security. That user can leave cards in a wallet, lying on the table, on a seat on public transport.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIf a card is lost or stolen, no amount of MFA can prevent contactless card fraud or card not present fraud. But protecting personal cards is the responsibility of the users, not the PCI ‚Äì which has no authority over users. Their cards and their phones are their own personal property. PCI DSS, continues Bush, sets and enforces standards for the payment card industry: ‚Äúthe requirements are written for merchants once they are the holder or custodian of the users‚Äô credit card information.‚Äù There is no attempt to tell users what to do.\n\n\n\nWhile this explains the absence of device attestation as part of the MFA requirement, the avoidance of specifying a particular type of MFA to be used by the industry (such as phishing resistant) can be better understood by looking at the DSS rules on encryption.\n\n\n\nEncryption\nThe encryption requirements specified in 4.0.1 have been extended. ‚ÄúTo ensure secure data transmission, TLS 1.2 or higher is now required, while SSL and early TLS versions are strictly prohibited due to security vulnerabilities,‚Äù explains Merlin. ‚ÄúEncryption at rest is also strengthened ‚Äì if disk-level encryption is used, organizations must implement additional controls to ensure Primary Account Numbers (PANs) remain unreadable. Secure key management and strong cryptographic algorithms are essential for maintaining compliance.‚Äù¬†\n\n\n\nBut the basic encryption of data has not changed. It is simply a requirement for ‚Äòstrong encryption‚Äô, with no attempt to define what constitutes strong encryption. On the surface, this appears surprising since NIST has spent most of the last decade developing stronger encryption; and the NSA is insisting that, from 2017, US national security systems can only purchase new products that include these new NIST standardized encryption algorithms.\n\n\n\nHowever, traditionally, PCI tries not to be overly prescriptive. It defines what must be achieved rather than how it must be achieved. There are good reasons for this. What offered good security last week may not offer good security next week; and what is good for one company may not be so good for another. In encryption, a strong algorithm this week could become a weak algorithm overnight if it is cracked. But the requirement for strong encryption remains a valid requirement regardless of the state of individual algorithms.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an issue that has been evaluated by the council,‚Äù explains Bush. The value of specific security controls and systems can change rapidly, and it affects far more than encryption alone. ‚ÄúSo, DSS requires that regulated bodies constantly monitor their technology and security controls against what‚Äôs happening in the real world. Is what has been used for the last few years still adequate? Is the encryption being used still strong, or has it been broken. Is it time to change from AES 128 to AES 256? PCI solves this problem by putting the liability back on the implementors, while the assessors can say ‚Äòyes‚Äô this is adequate today, or ‚Äòno‚Äô this is no longer adequate.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe same basic principle applies to MFA. It is on the implementer to install MFA, and the assessor to judge the implementation, including whether the MFA in this instance should be phishing resistant MFA, if that hasn‚Äôt been implemented.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe use of artificial intelligence is a complex area that is only just being seriously integrated into DSS ‚Äì remember that the original 4.0 was released back in 2022, the same year that ChatGPT began upending the world as we know it. PCI was aware of AI, but more as a contained ML function within different security products. It had no real understanding of publicly available LLMs.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVersion 4.0.1 does not prescriptively add anything around AI,‚Äù says Bush, ‚Äúand the council has only just begun writing guidance on the use of AI.‚Äù Within the last month it published a document on how it could be used by assessors, such as Bush himself. It is reasonable to use AI on black or white assessments like finding open ports; but perhaps not reasonable to allow it to make judgmental calls on whether a control is or is not necessary.\n\n\n\nBut the council gives no definitive guidance on whether a merchant or service provider should be using AI. ‚ÄúI can tell you the attitude toward AI is ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing new‚Äô. This is still a machine that is referencing code that was written either by a human or by some other artificial intelligence,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still software running on a server somewhere.

This is what became mandatory for the regulated entities on March 31, 2025. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a significant change,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúIt was significant to the template, but not significant to the underlying controls and what‚Äôs required of everyone.‚Äù What it demonstrates, however, is the speed and efficiency with which a standard developed by the industry for the industry can correct its own weaknesses.¬†\n\n\n\nThe focus on securing the industry rather than the user can be seen by looking closer at 4.0.1‚Äôs treatment of three current and major security concerns: MFA, encryption, and AI.\n\n\n\nMFA\nMFA controls are not new, but have been extended. ‚ÄúPCI DSS 4.0.1 extends MFA beyond just administrators, to all accounts accessing cardholder data,‚Äù comments Piyush Pandey, CEO at Pathlock. ‚ÄúIt also requires secure MFA implementation and configuration.‚Äù\n\n\n\nLanden further explains, ‚ÄúMFA is now required for access to the cardholder data environment and not just for VPN or remote access.‚Äù She adds that she would like to see emphasis on ‚Äòphishing resistant‚Äô MFA.\n\n\n\nIn short, says Vini Merlin, product manager at Oasis Security, ‚ÄúMFA requirements have expanded beyond remote access to include all access to the cardholder data environment (CDE). Additionally, organizations must conduct regular PCI DSS scope access reviews to ensure proper access controls.‚Äù\n\n\n\nNot everyone is happy with the extent of the extensions. ‚ÄúMobile devices are commonly used in MFA workflows,‚Äù comments Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP product strategy at Zimperium. ‚ÄúThere are no explicit requirements asking the systems to ensure they do not send OTP to compromised mobile devices. Since most financial services are accessed through mobile apps, malware is quite common for stealing credentials. By not requiring ‚Äòdevice attestation‚Äô bad actors are able to steal credentials and OTPs, resulting in account takeovers and fraud.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSo, is not requiring phishing resistant MFA nor device attestation a failing in the PCI DSS regulation? Probably not, if you consider the PCI‚Äôs own mandate. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rather bold assumption to consider that a card user requires MFA to use a personal card,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúThe user of a card can be very risky over personal security. That user can leave cards in a wallet, lying on the table, on a seat on public transport.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIf a card is lost or stolen, no amount of MFA can prevent contactless card fraud or card not present fraud. But protecting personal cards is the responsibility of the users, not the PCI ‚Äì which has no authority over users. Their cards and their phones are their own personal property. PCI DSS, continues Bush, sets and enforces standards for the payment card industry: ‚Äúthe requirements are written for merchants once they are the holder or custodian of the users‚Äô credit card information.‚Äù There is no attempt to tell users what to do.\n\n\n\nWhile this explains the absence of device attestation as part of the MFA requirement, the avoidance of specifying a particular type of MFA to be used by the industry (such as phishing resistant) can be better understood by looking at the DSS rules on encryption.\n\n\n\nEncryption\nThe encryption requirements specified in 4.0.1 have been extended. ‚ÄúTo ensure secure data transmission, TLS 1.2 or higher is now required, while SSL and early TLS versions are strictly prohibited due to security vulnerabilities,‚Äù explains Merlin. ‚ÄúEncryption at rest is also strengthened ‚Äì if disk-level encryption is used, organizations must implement additional controls to ensure Primary Account Numbers (PANs) remain unreadable. Secure key management and strong cryptographic algorithms are essential for maintaining compliance.‚Äù¬†\n\n\n\nBut the basic encryption of data has not changed. It is simply a requirement for ‚Äòstrong encryption‚Äô, with no attempt to define what constitutes strong encryption. On the surface, this appears surprising since NIST has spent most of the last decade developing stronger encryption; and the NSA is insisting that, from 2017, US national security systems can only purchase new products that include these new NIST standardized encryption algorithms.\n\n\n\nHowever, traditionally, PCI tries not to be overly prescriptive. It defines what must be achieved rather than how it must be achieved. There are good reasons for this. What offered good security last week may not offer good security next week; and what is good for one company may not be so good for another. In encryption, a strong algorithm this week could become a weak algorithm overnight if it is cracked. But the requirement for strong encryption remains a valid requirement regardless of the state of individual algorithms.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an issue that has been evaluated by the council,‚Äù explains Bush. The value of specific security controls and systems can change rapidly, and it affects far more than encryption alone. ‚ÄúSo, DSS requires that regulated bodies constantly monitor their technology and security controls against what‚Äôs happening in the real world. Is what has been used for the last few years still adequate? Is the encryption being used still strong, or has it been broken. Is it time to change from AES 128 to AES 256? PCI solves this problem by putting the liability back on the implementors, while the assessors can say ‚Äòyes‚Äô this is adequate today, or ‚Äòno‚Äô this is no longer adequate.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe same basic principle applies to MFA. It is on the implementer to install MFA, and the assessor to judge the implementation, including whether the MFA in this instance should be phishing resistant MFA, if that hasn‚Äôt been implemented.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe use of artificial intelligence is a complex area that is only just being seriously integrated into DSS ‚Äì remember that the original 4.0 was released back in 2022, the same year that ChatGPT began upending the world as we know it. PCI was aware of AI, but more as a contained ML function within different security products. It had no real understanding of publicly available LLMs.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVersion 4.0.1 does not prescriptively add anything around AI,‚Äù says Bush, ‚Äúand the council has only just begun writing guidance on the use of AI.‚Äù Within the last month it published a document on how it could be used by assessors, such as Bush himself. It is reasonable to use AI on black or white assessments like finding open ports; but perhaps not reasonable to allow it to make judgmental calls on whether a control is or is not necessary.\n\n\n\nBut the council gives no definitive guidance on whether a merchant or service provider should be using AI. ‚ÄúI can tell you the attitude toward AI is ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing new‚Äô. This is still a machine that is referencing code that was written either by a human or by some other artificial intelligence,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still software running on a server somewhere.

That user can leave cards in a wallet, lying on the table, on a seat on public transport.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIf a card is lost or stolen, no amount of MFA can prevent contactless card fraud or card not present fraud. But protecting personal cards is the responsibility of the users, not the PCI ‚Äì which has no authority over users. Their cards and their phones are their own personal property. PCI DSS, continues Bush, sets and enforces standards for the payment card industry: ‚Äúthe requirements are written for merchants once they are the holder or custodian of the users‚Äô credit card information.‚Äù There is no attempt to tell users what to do.\n\n\n\nWhile this explains the absence of device attestation as part of the MFA requirement, the avoidance of specifying a particular type of MFA to be used by the industry (such as phishing resistant) can be better understood by looking at the DSS rules on encryption.\n\n\n\nEncryption\nThe encryption requirements specified in 4.0.1 have been extended. ‚ÄúTo ensure secure data transmission, TLS 1.2 or higher is now required, while SSL and early TLS versions are strictly prohibited due to security vulnerabilities,‚Äù explains Merlin. ‚ÄúEncryption at rest is also strengthened ‚Äì if disk-level encryption is used, organizations must implement additional controls to ensure Primary Account Numbers (PANs) remain unreadable. Secure key management and strong cryptographic algorithms are essential for maintaining compliance.‚Äù¬†\n\n\n\nBut the basic encryption of data has not changed. It is simply a requirement for ‚Äòstrong encryption‚Äô, with no attempt to define what constitutes strong encryption. On the surface, this appears surprising since NIST has spent most of the last decade developing stronger encryption; and the NSA is insisting that, from 2017, US national security systems can only purchase new products that include these new NIST standardized encryption algorithms.\n\n\n\nHowever, traditionally, PCI tries not to be overly prescriptive. It defines what must be achieved rather than how it must be achieved. There are good reasons for this. What offered good security last week may not offer good security next week; and what is good for one company may not be so good for another. In encryption, a strong algorithm this week could become a weak algorithm overnight if it is cracked. But the requirement for strong encryption remains a valid requirement regardless of the state of individual algorithms.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an issue that has been evaluated by the council,‚Äù explains Bush. The value of specific security controls and systems can change rapidly, and it affects far more than encryption alone. ‚ÄúSo, DSS requires that regulated bodies constantly monitor their technology and security controls against what‚Äôs happening in the real world. Is what has been used for the last few years still adequate? Is the encryption being used still strong, or has it been broken. Is it time to change from AES 128 to AES 256? PCI solves this problem by putting the liability back on the implementors, while the assessors can say ‚Äòyes‚Äô this is adequate today, or ‚Äòno‚Äô this is no longer adequate.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe same basic principle applies to MFA. It is on the implementer to install MFA, and the assessor to judge the implementation, including whether the MFA in this instance should be phishing resistant MFA, if that hasn‚Äôt been implemented.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe use of artificial intelligence is a complex area that is only just being seriously integrated into DSS ‚Äì remember that the original 4.0 was released back in 2022, the same year that ChatGPT began upending the world as we know it. PCI was aware of AI, but more as a contained ML function within different security products. It had no real understanding of publicly available LLMs.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVersion 4.0.1 does not prescriptively add anything around AI,‚Äù says Bush, ‚Äúand the council has only just begun writing guidance on the use of AI.‚Äù Within the last month it published a document on how it could be used by assessors, such as Bush himself. It is reasonable to use AI on black or white assessments like finding open ports; but perhaps not reasonable to allow it to make judgmental calls on whether a control is or is not necessary.\n\n\n\nBut the council gives no definitive guidance on whether a merchant or service provider should be using AI. ‚ÄúI can tell you the attitude toward AI is ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing new‚Äô. This is still a machine that is referencing code that was written either by a human or by some other artificial intelligence,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still software running on a server somewhere. It‚Äôs still ones and zeros ‚Äì and we already have a secure framework that says how things should be operating.‚Äù\n\n\n\nWearing my Nostradamus hat, he adds, ‚ÄúI would suggest that the council is not going to issue anything hugely revelatory on how we should be assessing AI deployment in merchant environments. My guess is that it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äònothing new here‚Äô; we have a robust set of security controls and frameworks that AI also falls pretty squarely within.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAnd remember, by not regulating for the user, DSS can avoid getting bogged down in esoteric and subjective concerns over ethics.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, the only new requirement discusses the regulated entities‚Äô use of third-party AI implementations, and is more focused on vendor-related risks than AI per se. ‚ÄúWhile PCI DSS v4.0.1 does not explicitly regulate AI,‚Äù comments Merlin, ‚Äúorganizations must vet their AI vendors, ensuring these tools do not inadvertently store, process, or transmit card holder data outside of a controlled PCI DSS-compliant environment. AI-driven fraud detection, automation tools, and customer service platforms must be assessed for compliance risks to prevent unintentional data exposure.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation of the council‚Äôs traditional approach ‚Äì put liability for doing the right thing on the regulated entities, and then use the assessors to assess whether the actions are valid and conform to the spirit of the regulation.\n\n\n\nSummary¬†\n4.0.1 is a major new version of PCI DSS ‚Äì but it remains true to the council‚Äôs long standing principles. The correct way to secure one company might not be the correct way to secure another. For this reason, DSS primarily specifies required outcomes rather than precise methods of implementation. One requirement is that the regulated entities continually monitor the performance of their own security policies in achieving those outcomes, while the assessors are there to judge whether it is valid.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the standard remains strictly within its purview: by the industry for the industry. It has no remit on how users behave with their own payment cards and phones and cannot ‚Äì and consequently does not attempt ‚Äì to regulate user behavior.\n\n\n\nFor the industry itself, Landen comments, ‚ÄúThe implications come down to more effort and cost. For mature security organizations, this will not be a heavy lift. For less mature organizations, however, there will likely be an ongoing operational overhead including skilled people, process, and technology to comply with these new requirements.‚Äù\n\n\n\nDSS version 4.0.1 provides an excellent baseline or checklist for improving the security of companies.

Probably not, if you consider the PCI‚Äôs own mandate. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rather bold assumption to consider that a card user requires MFA to use a personal card,‚Äù explains Bush. ‚ÄúThe user of a card can be very risky over personal security. That user can leave cards in a wallet, lying on the table, on a seat on public transport.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIf a card is lost or stolen, no amount of MFA can prevent contactless card fraud or card not present fraud. But protecting personal cards is the responsibility of the users, not the PCI ‚Äì which has no authority over users. Their cards and their phones are their own personal property. PCI DSS, continues Bush, sets and enforces standards for the payment card industry: ‚Äúthe requirements are written for merchants once they are the holder or custodian of the users‚Äô credit card information.‚Äù There is no attempt to tell users what to do.\n\n\n\nWhile this explains the absence of device attestation as part of the MFA requirement, the avoidance of specifying a particular type of MFA to be used by the industry (such as phishing resistant) can be better understood by looking at the DSS rules on encryption.\n\n\n\nEncryption\nThe encryption requirements specified in 4.0.1 have been extended. ‚ÄúTo ensure secure data transmission, TLS 1.2 or higher is now required, while SSL and early TLS versions are strictly prohibited due to security vulnerabilities,‚Äù explains Merlin. ‚ÄúEncryption at rest is also strengthened ‚Äì if disk-level encryption is used, organizations must implement additional controls to ensure Primary Account Numbers (PANs) remain unreadable. Secure key management and strong cryptographic algorithms are essential for maintaining compliance.‚Äù¬†\n\n\n\nBut the basic encryption of data has not changed. It is simply a requirement for ‚Äòstrong encryption‚Äô, with no attempt to define what constitutes strong encryption. On the surface, this appears surprising since NIST has spent most of the last decade developing stronger encryption; and the NSA is insisting that, from 2017, US national security systems can only purchase new products that include these new NIST standardized encryption algorithms.\n\n\n\nHowever, traditionally, PCI tries not to be overly prescriptive. It defines what must be achieved rather than how it must be achieved. There are good reasons for this. What offered good security last week may not offer good security next week; and what is good for one company may not be so good for another. In encryption, a strong algorithm this week could become a weak algorithm overnight if it is cracked. But the requirement for strong encryption remains a valid requirement regardless of the state of individual algorithms.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an issue that has been evaluated by the council,‚Äù explains Bush. The value of specific security controls and systems can change rapidly, and it affects far more than encryption alone. ‚ÄúSo, DSS requires that regulated bodies constantly monitor their technology and security controls against what‚Äôs happening in the real world. Is what has been used for the last few years still adequate? Is the encryption being used still strong, or has it been broken. Is it time to change from AES 128 to AES 256? PCI solves this problem by putting the liability back on the implementors, while the assessors can say ‚Äòyes‚Äô this is adequate today, or ‚Äòno‚Äô this is no longer adequate.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe same basic principle applies to MFA. It is on the implementer to install MFA, and the assessor to judge the implementation, including whether the MFA in this instance should be phishing resistant MFA, if that hasn‚Äôt been implemented.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe use of artificial intelligence is a complex area that is only just being seriously integrated into DSS ‚Äì remember that the original 4.0 was released back in 2022, the same year that ChatGPT began upending the world as we know it. PCI was aware of AI, but more as a contained ML function within different security products. It had no real understanding of publicly available LLMs.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVersion 4.0.1 does not prescriptively add anything around AI,‚Äù says Bush, ‚Äúand the council has only just begun writing guidance on the use of AI.‚Äù Within the last month it published a document on how it could be used by assessors, such as Bush himself. It is reasonable to use AI on black or white assessments like finding open ports; but perhaps not reasonable to allow it to make judgmental calls on whether a control is or is not necessary.\n\n\n\nBut the council gives no definitive guidance on whether a merchant or service provider should be using AI. ‚ÄúI can tell you the attitude toward AI is ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing new‚Äô. This is still a machine that is referencing code that was written either by a human or by some other artificial intelligence,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still software running on a server somewhere. It‚Äôs still ones and zeros ‚Äì and we already have a secure framework that says how things should be operating.‚Äù\n\n\n\nWearing my Nostradamus hat, he adds, ‚ÄúI would suggest that the council is not going to issue anything hugely revelatory on how we should be assessing AI deployment in merchant environments. My guess is that it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äònothing new here‚Äô; we have a robust set of security controls and frameworks that AI also falls pretty squarely within.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAnd remember, by not regulating for the user, DSS can avoid getting bogged down in esoteric and subjective concerns over ethics.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, the only new requirement discusses the regulated entities‚Äô use of third-party AI implementations, and is more focused on vendor-related risks than AI per se. ‚ÄúWhile PCI DSS v4.0.1 does not explicitly regulate AI,‚Äù comments Merlin, ‚Äúorganizations must vet their AI vendors, ensuring these tools do not inadvertently store, process, or transmit card holder data outside of a controlled PCI DSS-compliant environment. AI-driven fraud detection, automation tools, and customer service platforms must be assessed for compliance risks to prevent unintentional data exposure.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation of the council‚Äôs traditional approach ‚Äì put liability for doing the right thing on the regulated entities, and then use the assessors to assess whether the actions are valid and conform to the spirit of the regulation.\n\n\n\nSummary¬†\n4.0.1 is a major new version of PCI DSS ‚Äì but it remains true to the council‚Äôs long standing principles. The correct way to secure one company might not be the correct way to secure another. For this reason, DSS primarily specifies required outcomes rather than precise methods of implementation.

It is simply a requirement for ‚Äòstrong encryption‚Äô, with no attempt to define what constitutes strong encryption. On the surface, this appears surprising since NIST has spent most of the last decade developing stronger encryption; and the NSA is insisting that, from 2017, US national security systems can only purchase new products that include these new NIST standardized encryption algorithms.\n\n\n\nHowever, traditionally, PCI tries not to be overly prescriptive. It defines what must be achieved rather than how it must be achieved. There are good reasons for this. What offered good security last week may not offer good security next week; and what is good for one company may not be so good for another. In encryption, a strong algorithm this week could become a weak algorithm overnight if it is cracked. But the requirement for strong encryption remains a valid requirement regardless of the state of individual algorithms.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an issue that has been evaluated by the council,‚Äù explains Bush. The value of specific security controls and systems can change rapidly, and it affects far more than encryption alone. ‚ÄúSo, DSS requires that regulated bodies constantly monitor their technology and security controls against what‚Äôs happening in the real world. Is what has been used for the last few years still adequate? Is the encryption being used still strong, or has it been broken. Is it time to change from AES 128 to AES 256? PCI solves this problem by putting the liability back on the implementors, while the assessors can say ‚Äòyes‚Äô this is adequate today, or ‚Äòno‚Äô this is no longer adequate.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe same basic principle applies to MFA. It is on the implementer to install MFA, and the assessor to judge the implementation, including whether the MFA in this instance should be phishing resistant MFA, if that hasn‚Äôt been implemented.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe use of artificial intelligence is a complex area that is only just being seriously integrated into DSS ‚Äì remember that the original 4.0 was released back in 2022, the same year that ChatGPT began upending the world as we know it. PCI was aware of AI, but more as a contained ML function within different security products. It had no real understanding of publicly available LLMs.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúVersion 4.0.1 does not prescriptively add anything around AI,‚Äù says Bush, ‚Äúand the council has only just begun writing guidance on the use of AI.‚Äù Within the last month it published a document on how it could be used by assessors, such as Bush himself. It is reasonable to use AI on black or white assessments like finding open ports; but perhaps not reasonable to allow it to make judgmental calls on whether a control is or is not necessary.\n\n\n\nBut the council gives no definitive guidance on whether a merchant or service provider should be using AI. ‚ÄúI can tell you the attitude toward AI is ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing new‚Äô.

It is reasonable to use AI on black or white assessments like finding open ports; but perhaps not reasonable to allow it to make judgmental calls on whether a control is or is not necessary.\n\n\n\nBut the council gives no definitive guidance on whether a merchant or service provider should be using AI. ‚ÄúI can tell you the attitude toward AI is ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing new‚Äô. This is still a machine that is referencing code that was written either by a human or by some other artificial intelligence,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still software running on a server somewhere. It‚Äôs still ones and zeros ‚Äì and we already have a secure framework that says how things should be operating.‚Äù\n\n\n\nWearing my Nostradamus hat, he adds, ‚ÄúI would suggest that the council is not going to issue anything hugely revelatory on how we should be assessing AI deployment in merchant environments. My guess is that it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äònothing new here‚Äô; we have a robust set of security controls and frameworks that AI also falls pretty squarely within.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAnd remember, by not regulating for the user, DSS can avoid getting bogged down in esoteric and subjective concerns over ethics.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, the only new requirement discusses the regulated entities‚Äô use of third-party AI implementations, and is more focused on vendor-related risks than AI per se. ‚ÄúWhile PCI DSS v4.0.1 does not explicitly regulate AI,‚Äù comments Merlin, ‚Äúorganizations must vet their AI vendors, ensuring these tools do not inadvertently store, process, or transmit card holder data outside of a controlled PCI DSS-compliant environment. AI-driven fraud detection, automation tools, and customer service platforms must be assessed for compliance risks to prevent unintentional data exposure.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation of the council‚Äôs traditional approach ‚Äì put liability for doing the right thing on the regulated entities, and then use the assessors to assess whether the actions are valid and conform to the spirit of the regulation.\n\n\n\nSummary¬†\n4.0.1 is a major new version of PCI DSS ‚Äì but it remains true to the council‚Äôs long standing principles. The correct way to secure one company might not be the correct way to secure another. For this reason, DSS primarily specifies required outcomes rather than precise methods of implementation. One requirement is that the regulated entities continually monitor the performance of their own security policies in achieving those outcomes, while the assessors are there to judge whether it is valid.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the standard remains strictly within its purview: by the industry for the industry.

The equivalent of a private key, these phrases can be used to import wallets to new devices.\n\n\n\nThe attacks have been hitting CRM and bulk email providers such as Mailchimp, Hubspot, Mailgun, SendGrid, and Zoho, targeting users of Coinbase and Ledger, cyber intelligence firm Silent Push says.\n\n\n\nFor the past month, PoisonSeed has been targeting potential victims with phishing emails claiming that Coinbase was moving to self-custodial wallets, and urging users to transfer their assets to new cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n\n\nTo evade detection, instead of embedding malicious links in their messages, the attackers included security seed phrases, instructing the recipients to use them when creating new wallets, thus gaining access to the funds.\n\n\n\nCoinbase alerted users of such attacks in mid-March, warning them to never enter a recovery phrase received by someone else. Coinbase users are estimated to have lost roughly $46 million worth of cryptocurrency to phishing.\n\n\n\nThe Coinbase phishing emails, Silent Push says, were sent from a compromised Akamai SendGrid account that was also used to send phishing messages aimed at compromising other organizations‚Äô SendGrid accounts, likely to perpetuate the scam through more bulk email accounts.\n\n\n\nDigging deeper, the cybersecurity firm identified 49 unique domains that were connected to the phishing campaign and discovered that the threat actor was also targeting Ledger wallets.Advertisement.

This change will take place over the span of several nights. We are doing this to provide additional clarity regarding which CVE records are prioritized,‚Äù NIST announced.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúWe will continue to accept and review requests to update the metadata provided for these CVE records. Should any new information clearly indicate that an update to the enrichment data for the CVE is appropriate, we will continue to prioritize those requests as time and resources allow,‚Äù NIST said.\n\n\n\nShortly after the announcement, the count for CVE entries marked Deferred jumped to 20,000. The total number, however, could reach 100,000 soon: as vulnerability researcher Patrick Garrity pointed out, roughly one in three CVEs in the NVD is older than 2018.\n\n\n\nThis shift of priorities is not surprising. Struggling with growing delays in the analysis of CVEs, NIST has been looking for ways to clear the CVE backlog for over a year, including through outside help.\n\n\n\nA year ago, the institute was rather confident it would clear the backlog by the end of fiscal year 2024, but failed to do so, mainly because it could not efficiently import and enrich the data it was receiving.¬†¬†\n\n\n\n‚ÄúTo address this issue, we are developing new systems that will allow us to process incoming ADP data more efficiently,‚Äù NIST said in November.Advertisement.
