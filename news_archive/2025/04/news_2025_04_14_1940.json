        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new, sophisticated remote access trojan called ResolverRAT that has been observed in attacks targeting healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors.\n\"The threat actor leverages fear-based lures delivered via phishing emails, designed to pressure recipients into clicking a malicious link,\" Morphisec Labs researcher Nadav Lorber\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News. \"Once accessed, the link directs the user to download and open a file that triggers the ResolverRAT execution chain.\"\nThe activity, observed as recently as March 10, 2025, shares infrastructure and delivery mechanism overlap with phishing campaigns that have delivered information stealer malware such as Lumma and Rhadamanthys, as documented by\nCisco Talos\nand\nCheck Point\nlast year.\nA notable aspect of the campaign is the use of localized phishing lures, with the emails crafted in the languages predominantly spoken in the targeted countries. This includes Hindi, Italian, Czech, Turkish, Portuguese, and Indonesian, indicating the threat actor's attempts to cast a wide net through region-specific targeting and maximize infection rates.\nThe textual content in the email messages employs themes related to legal investigations or copyright violations that seek to induce a false sense of urgency and increase the likelihood of user interaction.\nThe infection chain is characterized by the use of the DLL side-loading technique to initiate the process. The first stage is an in-memory loader that decrypts and executes the main payload while also incorporating a bevy of tricks to fly under the radar. Not only does the ResolverRAT payload use encryption and compression, but it also exists only in memory once it's decoded.\n\"The ResolverRAT's initialization sequence reveals a sophisticated, multi-stage bootstrapping process engineered for stealth and resilience,\" Lorber said, adding it \"implements multiple redundant persistence methods\" by means of Windows Registry and on the file system by installing itself in different locations as a fallback mechanism.\nOnce launched, the malware utilizes a bespoke certificate-based authentication prior to establishing contact with a command-and-control (C2) server such that it bypasses the machine's root authorities. It also implements an IP rotation system to connect to an alternate C2 server if the primary C2 server becomes unavailable or gets taken down.\nFurthermore, ResolverRAT is fitted with capabilities to sidestep detection efforts through certificate pinning, source code obfuscation, and irregular beaconing patterns to the C2 server.\n\"This advanced C2 infrastructure demonstrates the advanced capabilities of the threat actor, combining secure communications, fallback mechanisms, and evasion techniques designed to maintain persistent access while evading detection by security monitoring systems,\" Morphisec said.\nThe ultimate goal of the malware is to process commands issued by the C2 server and exfiltrate the responses back, breaking data over 1 MB in size into 16 KB chunks so as to minimize the chances of detection.\nThe campaign has yet to be attributed to a specific group or country, although the similarities in lure themes and the use of DLL side-loading with previously observed phishing attacks allude to a possible connection.\n\"The alignment [...] indicates a possible overlap in threat actor infrastructure or operational playbooks, potentially pointing to a shared affiliate model or coordinated activity among related threat groups,\" the company said.\nThe development comes as CYFIRMA detailed another remote access trojan codenamed Neptune RAT that uses a modular, plugin-based approach to steal information, maintain persistence on the host, demand a $500 ransom, and even overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR) to disrupt the normal functioning of the Windows system.\nIt's being propagated freely via GitHub, Telegram, and YouTube. That said, the GitHub profile associated with the malware, called the\nMasonGroup\n(aka FREEMASONRY), is no longer accessible.\n\"Neptune RAT incorporates advanced anti-analysis techniques and persistence methods to maintain its presence on the victim's system for extended periods and comes packed with dangerous features,\" the company\nnoted\nin an analysis published last week.\nIt includes a \"crypto clipper, password stealer with capabilities to exfiltrate over 270+ different applications' credentials, ransomware capabilities, and live desktop monitoring, making it an extremely serious threat.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new type of credential phishing scheme that ensures that the stolen information is associated with valid online accounts.\nThe technique has been codenamed precision-validating phishing by Cofense, which it said employs real-time email validation so that only a select set of high-value targets are served the fake login screens.\n\"This tactic not only gives the threat actors a higher success rate on obtaining usable credentials as they only engage with a specific pre-harvested list of valid email accounts,\" the company\nsaid\n.\nUnlike \"spray-and-pray\" credential harvesting campaigns that typically involve the bulk distribution of spam emails to obtain victims' login information in an indiscriminate fashion, the latest attack tactic takes spear-phishing to the next level by only engaging with email addresses that attackers have verified as active, legitimate, and high-value.\nIn this scenario, the email address entered by the victim in a phishing landing page is validated against the attacker's database, after which the bogus login page is displayed. If the email address does not exist in the database, the page either returns an error or the user is redirected to an innocuous page like Wikipedia so as to evade security analysis.\nThe checks are carried out by integrating an API- or JavaScript-based validation service into the phishing kit that confirms the email address before proceeding to the password capture step.\n\"It increases the efficiency of the attack and the likelihood that stolen credentials belong to real, actively used accounts, improving the quality of harvested data for resale or further exploitation,\" Cofense said.\n\"Automated security crawlers and sandbox environments also struggle to analyze these attacks because they cannot bypass the validation filter. This targeted approach reduces attacker risk and extends the lifespan of phishing campaigns.\"\nThe development comes as the cybersecurity company also revealed details of an email phishing campaign that uses file deletion reminders as a lure to grab credentials as well as deliver malware.\nThe two-pronged attack leverages an embedded URL that seemingly points to a PDF file that's scheduled to be deleted from a legitimate file storage service called files.fm. Should the message recipient click on the link, they are taken to legitimate files.fm link from where they can download the purported PDF file.\nHowever, when the\nPDF is opened\n, users are presented with two options to either preview or download the file. Users who opt for the former are taken to a bogus Microsoft login screen that's designed to steal their credentials. When the download option is selected, it drops an executable that claims to be Microsoft OneDrive, but, in reality, is the ScreenConnect remote desktop software from ConnectWise.\nIt's \"almost as if the threat actor intentionally designed the attack to trap the user, forcing them to choose which 'poison' they will fall for,\" Cofense\nsaid\n. \"Both options lead to the same outcome, with similar goals but different approaches to achieving them.\"\nThe findings also follow the discovery of a sophisticated multi-stage attack that combines vishing, remote access tooling, and living-off-the-land techniques to gain initial access and establish persistence. The tradecraft observed in the activity is consistent with clusters tracked as\nStorm-1811\n(aka STAC5777).\n\"The threat actor exploited exposed communication channels by delivering a malicious PowerShell payload via a Microsoft Teams message, followed by the use of\nQuick Assist\nto remotely access the environment,\" Ontinue\nsaid\n. \"This led to the deployment of signed binaries (e.g., TeamViewer.exe), a sideloaded malicious DLL (TV.dll), and ultimately a JavaScript-based C2 backdoor executed via Node.js.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Attackers aren't waiting for patches anymore — they are breaking in before defenses are ready. Trusted security tools are being hijacked to deliver malware. Even after a breach is detected and patched, some attackers stay hidden.\nThis week's events show a hard truth: it's not enough to react after an attack. You have to assume that any system you trust today could fail tomorrow. In a world where AI tools can be used against you and ransomware hits faster than ever, real protection means planning for things to go wrong — and still staying in control.\nCheck out this week's update to find important threat news, helpful webinars, useful tools, and tips you can start using right away.\n⚡ Threat of the Week\nWindows 0-Day Exploited for Ransomware Attacks\n— A security affecting the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) was\nexploited\nas a zero-day in ransomware attacks aimed at a small number of targets, Microsoft revealed. The flaw, CVE-2025-29824, is a privilege escalation vulnerability that could allow an attacker to obtain SYSTEM privileges. An exploit for the vulnerability has been found to be delivered via a trojan called PipeMagic, with the unknown threat actors, tracked by Microsoft as Storm-2460, conducting credential harvesting and dropping a ransomware payload as part of post-compromise exploitation activities. The exact nature of the payload is unclear, however, the ransom note dropped after encryption included a TOR domain tied to the RansomEXX ransomware family. CVE-2025-29824 was\naddressed\nby Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday update for April 2025.\n2025 State of Code Security: Key Trends and Threats\nIn cloud-native environments, the security of your code repositories and development pipelines is critical. Do you know the most pressing risks facing your organization today? By analyzing hundreds of thousands of repositories, the Wiz Threat Research team uncovered key vulnerabilities and attacker strategies in the new\n2025 State of Code Security Report\n.\nKey stats include:\n35% of GitHub repositories are public, providing malicious actors with easy access to exploits if developers make critical mistakes\n61% of organizations have cloud secrets, like API keys and access tokens, exposed in public repositories\nDownload the report to explore all the findings in detail and learn actionable strategies to protect your organization.\nDownload the Report ➝\n🔔 Top News\nESET Flaw Exploited to Deliver New TCESB Malware\n— The China-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group China-aligned\nToddyCat\nhas exploited a vulnerability in ESET's antivirus software to silently execute a malicious payload called TCESB on infected devices. The dynamic link library (DLL) search order hijacking vulnerability (CVE-2024-11859) was patched in January after responsible disclosure. DLL search order hijacking is a kind of vulnerability that occurs when an application searches and loads a required DLL in an insecure order, such as starting with the current directory rather than a trusted system directory. In such instances, an attacker can try to trick the application into loading a malicious DLL as opposed to its legitimate counterpart. Once executed, TCESB reads the running kernel version and disables notification routines, installs a vulnerable driver for defense evasion, and launches an unspecified payload.\nFortinet Warns of Hackers Retaining Access to Patched FortiGate VPNs Using Symlinks\n— Fortinet revealed that threat actors have found a way to maintain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the initial access vector used to breach the devices was patched. \"This was achieved via creating a symbolic link (aka\nsymlink\n) connecting the user file system and the root file system in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN,\" the company\nsaid\n. Fortinet has released patches to eliminate the behavior.\nAkiraBot Leans on OpenAI Models to Flood Sites with SEO Spam\n— An artificial intelligence (AI) powered platform called AkiraBot is being used to spam website chats, comment sections, and contact forms to promote dubious search engine optimization (SEO) services such as Akira and ServicewrapGO. The platform relies on OpenAI API to generate a customized outreach message based on the contents of the website. As many as 80,000 websites have been successfully spammed by the tool since September 2024. In response to the findings, OpenAI has disabled the API key used by the threat actors.\nGamaredon Uses Removable Drives to Distribute GammaSteel Malware\n— The Russia-linked threat actor known as\nGamaredon\ntargeted a foreign military mission based in Ukraine to deliver an updated version of a known malware called GammaSteel using what appears to be an already infected removable drive. The attack paves the way for a reconnaissance utility and an improved version of GammaSteel, an information stealer that's capable of exfiltrating files from a victim based on an extension allowlist from the Desktop and Documents folders.\nPalo Alto Networks Warns of Brute-Force Attempts Targeting PAN-OS GlobalProtect Portals\n— Palo Alto Networks has\ndisclosed\nthat it's observing brute-force login attempts against PAN-OS GlobalProtect gateways. It also noted that its activity monitoring the situation to determine its potential impact and identify if mitigations are necessary. The development came in response to an alert from GreyNoise about a spike in suspicious login scanning activity aimed at PAN-OS GlobalProtect portals since March 17, 2025.\nTrending CVEs\nAttackers love software vulnerabilities—they're easy doors into your systems. Every week brings fresh flaws, and waiting too long to patch can turn a minor oversight into a major breach. Below are this week's critical vulnerabilities you need to know about. Take a look, update your software promptly, and keep attackers locked out.\nThis week's list includes —\nCVE-2025-3102\n(OttoKit plugin),\nCVE-2025-23359\n(NVIDIA Container Toolkit),\nCVE-2025-30406\n(Gladinet CentreStack),\nCVE-2025-29824\n(Windows Common Log File System),\nCVE-2024-48887\n(Fortinet FortiSwitch),\nCVE-2024-53150, CVE-2024-53197\n(Google Android),\nCVE-2025-2945\n(pgAdmin),\nCVE-2025-2244\n(Bitdefender GravityZone),\nCVE-2025-31334\n(WinRAR),\nCVE-2025-30401\n(WhatsApp for Windows),\nCVE-2025-23120\n(Rockwell Automation Industrial Data Center),\nCVE-2025-25211\n,\nCVE-2025-26689\n(Inaba Denki Sangyo CHOCO TEI WATCHER),\nCVE-2024-4872\n,\nCVE-2024-3980\n(Hitachi Energy MicroSCADA Pro/X SYS600),\nCVE-2025-2636\n(InstaWP Connect – 1-click WP Staging & Migration plugin),\nCVE-2025-3439\n(Everest Forms – Contact Form, Quiz, Survey, Newsletter & Payment Form Builder for WordPress plugin), and\nCVE-2025-31565\n(WPSmartContracts plugin).\n📰 Around the Cyber World\nBulletproof Hosting Service Provider Medialand Exposed\n— A bulletproof hosting service provider named Medialand has been exposed likely by the same actors behind the leak of\nBlack Basta chat logs\nin February 2025. According to\nPRODAFT\n, Medialand has been linked to Yalishanda (LARVA-34), with the service playing a key role in enabling a wide range of cybercriminal operations, including hosting ransomware infrastructure for Black Basta, malware C2 servers, code-signing systems, phishing kits, data exfiltration panels, data leak sites. Leaked internal data reveals a treasure trove of information about who bought servers, who paid (including via cryptocurrency), and possibly personally identifiable information (PII), not to mention allow defenders to correlate indicators of compromise (IoCs) and improve attribution efforts. The Black Basta chat dataset shed light on the group's \"internal workflows, decision-making processes, and team dynamics, offering an unfiltered perspective on how one of the most active ransomware groups operates behind the scenes,\" Trustwave\nsaid\n. The discussions also revealed the group targeting individuals based on gender dynamics, assigning female callers to male victims and male operators to female targets. Furthermore, they also expose the threat actor's pursuit of security flaws and stockpiling them by paying premium prices to acquire zero-day exploits from exploit brokers to gain a competitive edge.\nArabic-Speaking Threat Actor Targets South Korea with ViperSoftX\n— Suspected Arabic-speaking threat actors have been observed distributing\nViperSoftX\nmalware targeting South Korean victims since April 1, 2025. Often distributed via cracked software or torrents, ViperSoftX is known for its ability to exfiltrate sensitive information from compromised Windows hosts, as well as deliver additional payloads like Quasar RAT and TesseractStealer. In the attacks\ndetected\nby AhnLab, the malware has been found to serve a malicious PowerShell script that drops PureCrypter and Quasar RAT.\nIrish Data Protection Watchdog Probes X\n— Ireland's data privacy regulator has opened an investigation into X over its processing of personal data from publicly accessible posts shared on the social network for purposes of training its artificial intelligence models, particularly Grok. \"The inquiry will examine compliance with a range of key provisions of the GDPR, including with regard to the lawfulness and transparency of the processing,\" the Data Protection Commission (DPC)\nsaid\n. \"The purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether this personal data was lawfully processed in order to train the Grok LLMs.\" X previously X agreed to stop training its AI systems using personal data collected from E.U. users.\nFlaws Uncovered in Perplexity's Android App\n— An analysis of Perplexity AI's Android app has uncovered a set of 11 flaws, including hard-coded API keys, cross-origin resource sharing (\nCORS\n) misconfigurations, lack of SSL pinning, unsecured network configuration, tapjacking, and susceptibility to known flaws like Janus and StrandHogg, exposing users of the app to risks such as data theft, account takeovers, and reverse engineering attacks. \"Hackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to steal your personal data, including sensitive login credentials,\" AppKnox said in a report shared with The Hacker News. \"The app lacks protections against hacking tools, leaving your device vulnerable to remote attacks.\" Similar flaws were also\nidentified\nin DeepSeek's Android app earlier this year.\nTycoon 2FA Phishing Kit Receives New Updates\n— The latest version of the phishing kit known as\nTycoon 2FA\nhas adopted new evasion techniques that allow it to slip past endpoints and detection systems. \"These include using a custom\nCAPTCHA\nrendered via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode characters in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to thwart inspection,\" Trustwave\nsaid\n. \"HTML5-based visuals like the custom CAPTCHA can mislead users and add legitimacy to phishing attempts. Unicode and Proxy-based obfuscation can delay detection and make static analysis more difficult.\" The development comes as the cybersecurity company said it has identified a dramatic increase in phishing attacks using malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files, driven by PhaaS platforms like Tycoon2FA, Mamba2FA, and Sneaky2FA. \"SVG-based attacks have sharply pivoted toward phishing campaigns, with a staggering 1,800% increase in early 2025 compared to data collected since April 2024,\" it\nsaid\n.\nChina Reportedly Admits to Directing Cyber Attacks on US Critical Infra\n— Chinese officials have acknowledged in a secret meeting in December 2024 that it was behind a series of cyber attacks aimed at U.S. critical infrastructure, a cluster of activity that's known as Volt Typhoon, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n, citing, people familiar with the matter. The attacks are said to have been conducted in response to increasing U.S. policy support for Taiwan. China had previously claimed the Volt Typhoon to be a\ndisinformation campaign\nfrom the West.\nAWS Debuts Support for ML-KEM in KMS, ACM, and Secrets Manager\n— Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced support for Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (\nML-KEM\n) for hybrid post-quantum key agreement in Key Management Service (AWS KMS), Certificate Manager (ACM), and Secrets Manager. \"These three services were chosen because they are security-critical AWS services with the most urgent need for post-quantum confidentiality,\" Amazon\nsaid\n. \"With this, customers can bring secrets into their applications with end-to-end post-quantum enabled TLS.\" The development comes as the OpenSSL Project\nreleased\nversion 3.5.0 of its widely used cryptographic library with support for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA.\nExploitation Attempts Against TVT DVRs Surge\n— Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise is\nwarning\nof a 3x spike in exploitation attempts against TVT NVMS9000 DVRs as part of what's suspected to be malicious activity designed to rope the devices into the Mirai botnet. The attacks exploit an\ninformation disclosure vulnerability\n(no CVE) that can be used to gain administrative control over affected systems. The surge in attacks began on March 31, 2025, with over 6,600 unique IP addresses, mainly from Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, targeting systems located in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, attempting to exploit the flaw over the past 30 days.\nGitHub Announces General Availability of Security Campaigns\n— GitHub has announced the general availability of Security Campaigns, a new feature that aims to streamline the vulnerability remediation process using Copilot Autofix to generate code suggestions and resolve issues. The aim, per the Microsoft-owned platform, is to reduce security debt and quickly address problems lurking in existing codebases. \"Using Copilot Autofix to generate code suggestions for up to 1,000 code scanning alerts at a time, security campaigns help security teams take care of triage and prioritization, while you can quickly resolve issues using Autofix – without breaking your development momentum,\" GitHub\nsaid\n.\nWatch Out for SMS Pumping\n— Threat hunters are calling attention to a cybercrime tactic called SMS pumping fraud that exploits SMS verification systems (e.g., OTP requests or password resets) to generate excessive message traffic using fake or automated phone numbers, incurring businesses additional costs or disruptions. Such schemes employ automated bots or low-skilled workforce to trigger fake account creation and OTP requests, which send SMS messages to phone numbers controlled by the threat actor. \"The fraudster collaborates with a 'rogue party,' often a corrupt telecom provider or intermediary with access to SMS routing infrastructure,\" Group-IB\nsaid\n. \"The rogue party intercepts the inflated SMS traffic, typically avoiding message delivery to reduce costs. Instead, they route the traffic to numbers they control.\"\nRouters Among the Most Riskiest Devices in Enterprise Networks\n— According to data compiled by Forescout, network-related equipment such as routers have emerged as the riskiest category of IT devices. \"Driven by increased threat actor focus, adversaries are rapidly exploiting new vulnerabilities in these devices through large-scale attack campaigns,\" the company said. The retail sector has the riskiest devices on average, followed by financial services, government, healthcare, and manufacturing. Spain, China, the United Kingdom, Qatar, and Singapore are the top five countries with the riskiest devices on average. \"To effectively defend this evolving attack surface, organizations must adopt modern security strategies that address risk across all device categories,\" Forescout\nsaid\n. \"As threat actors continue shifting their focus away from traditional endpoints, they increasingly target less-protected devices that offer easier initial access.\"\nSpanish Authorities Arrest 6 for AI-Powered Investment Scam\n— The National Police of Spain has\narrested\nsix individuals aged between 34 and 57 behind a large-scale cryptocurrency investment scam that used AI tools to generate deepfake ads featuring popular public figures to deceive people, defrauding 208 victims worldwide of €19 million ($21.6 million). More than €100,000 of the total money defrauded from the victims has been frozen as part of the operation codenamed COINBLACK - WENDIMINE. \"The modus operandi used to carry out this scam consisted of inserting ads on different web pages as a hook related to investments in cryptocurrencies,\" the National Police said. \"The victims were not selected at random, but, through algorithms, they selected those people whose profile fit into what cybercriminals were looking for.\" The investment scam involved inserting ads on web pages and social media networks and using AI tools to falsely claim endorsements from famous personalities so as to entice the targets into making the investments. Some aspects of the scam were\ndetailed\nby ESET in December 2024, which codenamed the campaign Nomani.\nOracle Says Hack Affected \"Obsolete Servers\"\n— Oracle has confirmed that a hacker stole and leaked credentials that were stolen from what it described as \"two obsolete servers.\" However, the company downplayed the severity of the breach and insisted its cloud infrastructure (OCI) was not compromised and that no customer data and services were impacted by the incident. \"A hacker did access and publish user names from two obsolete servers that were never a part of OCI,\" it\nsaid\nin an email notification. \"The hacker did not expose usable passwords because the passwords on those two servers were either encrypted and/or hashed. Therefore the hacker was not able to access any customer environments or customer data.\" It's not known how many customers were affected.\nAtlas Lion Uses New Tactics in Attacks Targeting Retailers\n— The Moroccan threat actor known as\nAtlas Lion\n(aka Storm-0539) has been observed using stolen credentials to enroll attacker-controlled VMs into an organization's domain, per cybersecurity firm Expel. Known for its extensive understanding of the cloud, the group's primary goal appears to be redeeming or reselling the\nstolen gift cards\nthey obtain during their attack campaigns.\nU.S. Treasury OCC Says Hackers Had Access to 150,000 Emails\n— The Treasury Department's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)\nrevealed\nin February 2025 that it \"identified, isolated and resolved a security incident involving an administrative account in the OCC email system.\" As a result, a limited number of affected administrative accounts were identified and disabled. \"There is no indication of any impact to the financial sector at this time,\" the OCC said at the time. Now, in an update, the OCC has\nclassified\nthe breach as a \"major incident,\" adding \"the unauthorized access to a number of its executives' and employees' emails included highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions used in its examinations and supervisory oversight processes.\" Bloomberg\nreported\nthat the unidentified threat actors behind the hack broke into an email system administrator's account and gained access to over 150,000 emails from May 2023 after intercepting about 103 bank regulators' emails.\n🎥 Cybersecurity Webinars\n1️⃣\nLearn to Detect and Block Hidden AI Tools in Your SaaS Stack\n— AI tools are quietly connecting to your SaaS apps — often without Security's knowledge. Sensitive data is at risk. Manual tracking won't keep up.\nIn this session, learn:\nHow AI tools are exposing your environment\nReal-world examples of AI-driven attacks\nHow Reco helps detect and respond automatically\nJoin Dvir Sasson from Reco to get ahead of\nhidden AI threats\n.\n2️⃣\nLearn How to Secure Every Step of Your Identity Lifecycle\n— Identity is your new attack surface. AI-powered impersonation and deepfakes are breaking traditional defenses. Learn how to secure the full identity lifecycle — from enrollment to daily access to recovery — with phishing-resistant MFA, device trust, and Deepfake Defense™.\nJoin Beyond Identity and Nametag to\nstop account takeovers\nbefore they start.\n🔧 Cybersecurity Tools\nCAPE\n(Config and Payload Extraction) — CAPE is a powerful malware sandbox that runs suspicious files in a safe Windows environment and digs much deeper than traditional tools. It not only tracks file changes, network traffic, and memory dumps but also automatically unpacks hidden payloads, extracts malware settings, and defeats tricks used to avoid detection. With smart use of YARA rules and a built-in debugger, CAPE gives threat hunters and analysts a faster, clearer way to uncover what malware is really doing.\nMCP-Scan\n— It is an open-source security tool that checks your MCP servers for hidden risks like prompt injections, tool poisoning, and cross-origin attacks. It scans popular setups like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf, detects tampering in tool descriptions, and helps catch silent changes that could compromise your environment. With built-in protections like tool pinning and Invariant Guardrail checks, MCP-Scan gives developers and security teams a fast, reliable way to spot vulnerabilities before attackers can use them.\n🔒 Tip of the Week\nMonitoring for Unauthorized Account Activations\n— Attackers are using a clever trick to stay hidden inside networks: reactivating the built-in Windows Guest account. Normally, this account is disabled and ignored by system admins. But when attackers enable it and set a new password, it blends in as part of the system — making it easy for them to quietly log in, escalate privileges, and even access devices remotely through RDP. Since the Guest account looks normal at first glance, many security teams miss it during reviews.\nTo catch this tactic early, monitor your security logs closely. Set alerts for Event ID 4722 — this signals when any disabled account is reactivated, including Guest. Also track the use of native Windows tools like net.exe, wmic, and PowerShell for any commands that modify accounts. Pay special attention to any Guest account being added to privileged groups like Administrators or Remote Desktop Users. Cross-check with your endpoint protection or EDR tools to spot changes outside normal maintenance windows.\nIf you find an active Guest account, assume it's part of a larger breach. Check for signs of hidden accounts, unauthorized remote access tools, and changes to RDP settings. Regular threat hunting — even just checking that all default accounts are truly disabled — can break an attacker's persistence before they move deeper into your environment.\nConclusion\nEvery breach, every evasion technique, and every new tool attackers use is also a learning opportunity. If you're in cybersecurity today, your advantage isn't just your tech stack — it's how quickly you adapt.\nTake one tactic you saw in this week's update — privilege escalation, AI misuse, stealth persistence — and use it as a reason to strengthen a weak spot you've been putting off. Defense is a race, but improvement is a choice.\nFound this article interesting?  Follow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "AI is changing cybersecurity faster than many defenders realize. Attackers are already using AI to automate reconnaissance, generate sophisticated phishing lures, and exploit vulnerabilities before security teams can react. Meanwhile, defenders are overwhelmed by massive amounts of data and alerts, struggling to process information quickly enough to identify real threats. AI offers a way to level the playing field, but only if security professionals learn to apply it effectively.\nOrganizations are beginning to integrate AI into security workflows, from digital forensics to vulnerability assessments and endpoint detection. AI allows security teams to ingest and analyze more data than ever before, transforming traditional security tools into powerful intelligence engines. AI has already demonstrated its ability to accelerate investigations and uncover unknown attack paths, but many companies are hesitant to fully embrace it. Many AI models are implemented with such velocity that they remain untested with few organizations that have any basic security or auditing guidelines for their implementation. As a result, AI can increase risks instead of reducing them, particularly when it comes to privacy and data protection. There is a lack of proper security culture for AI implementation in organizations that have to remain competitive and reduce the costs of compute needed. On the other side, you have many organizations completely not implementing AI at all, even banning it among their employees, due to a lack of understanding of the risks as well. There has to be balance – decreasing risk, increasing competitiveness, reducing costs, and making fast decisions for an entire organization like a fighter pilot in the middle of a dogfight. One wrong decision in the above can become irreversibly devastating for the organization.\nOne of the biggest challenges in cybersecurity today is the lack of professionals who are studying and learning how to apply AI effectively. Security teams need to study AI advancements daily/hourly because adversaries are adapting in hours/minutes. There is no time to wait for someone to write the book to solve these challenges, wait a single week, and the book is now aged – that is how fast the field is moving. The organizations that embrace AI will have a significant advantage over those that delay its adoption.\nTo meet this need, SANS Institute is offering\nApplied Data Science & Machine Learning for Cybersecurity\n, a course designed to teach security professionals how to use AI and Machine Language core understanding to wrap around capabilities in their organization for defense strategies. This hands-on training covers how to utilize and build AI and machine learning models for threat detection, automate security processes, and improve threat intelligence analysis. Security teams do not need a background in data science (we teach it) to take this course, just a desire to learn and apply AI in their lives – daily.\nFor those who want to gain these critical skills,\nSANSFIRE 2025\nis the ideal opportunity. The event will take place\nJune 16-21, 2025, in Washington, D.C.\n, bringing together top cybersecurity professionals for hands-on training, live labs, and expert-led discussions. The SEC595:\nApplied Data Science & Machine Learning for Cybersecurity\ncourse will be available at SANSFIRE, allowing attendees to experience AI-driven security firsthand and apply what they learn immediately.\nCybersecurity is evolving at an unprecedented pace, and defenders must evolve with it. The question is not whether AI will be a part of cybersecurity operations, but who will master it first. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, join us at\nSANSFIRE 2025\n.

It's so named for\nmimicking the attack chains\nassociated with another threat actor called\nSideWinder\nto deliver its own payloads.\nIn June 2024, SEQRITE\nhighlighted\nSideCopy's use of obfuscated HTA files, leveraging a technique previously observed in SideWinder attacks. The files were also found to contain references to URLs that hosted RTF files identified as used by SideWinder.\nThe attacks culminated in the deployment of\nAction RAT\nand\nReverseRAT\n, two known malware families attributed to SideCopy, and several other payloads, including Cheex to steal documents and images, a USB copier to siphon data from attached drives, and a .NET-based Geta RAT that's capable of executing 30 commands sent from a remote server.\nThe RAT is equipped to steal both Firefox and Chromium-based browser data of all accounts, profiles, and cookies, a feature borrowed from AsyncRAT.\n\"APT36 focus is majorly Linux systems whereas SideCopy targets Windows systems adding new payloads to its arsenal,\" SEQRITE noted at the time.\nThe latest findings demonstrate a continued maturation of the hacking group, coming into its own, while leveraging email-based phishing as a distribution vector for malware. These email messages contain various kinds of lure documents, ranging from holiday lists for railway staff to cybersecurity guidelines issued by a public sector undertaking called the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL).\nOne cluster of activity is particularly noteworthy given its ability to target both Windows and Linux systems, ultimately leading to the deployment of a cross-platform remote access trojan known as\nSpark RAT\nand a new Windows-based malware codenamed CurlBack RAT that can gather system information, download files from the host, execute arbitrary commands, elevate privileges, and list user accounts.\nA second cluster has been observed using the decoy files as a way to initiate a multi-step infection process that drops a custom version of\nXeno RAT\n, which incorporates basic string manipulation methods.\n\"The group has shifted from using HTA files to MSI packages as a primary staging mechanism and continues to employ advanced techniques like DLL side-loading, reflective loading, and AES decryption via PowerShell,\" the company said.\n\"Additionally, they are leveraging customized open-source tools like Xeno RAT and Spark RAT, along with deploying the newly identified CurlBack RAT. Compromised domains and fake sites are being utilized for credential phishing and payload hosting, highlighting the group's ongoing efforts to enhance persistence and evade detection.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The CA/Browser Forum has voted to significantly reduce the lifespan of SSL/TLS certificates over the next 4 years, with a final lifespan of just 47 days starting in 2029.\nThe CA/Browser Forum is a group of certificate authorities (CAs) and software vendors, including browser developers, working together to establish and maintain security standards for digital certificates used in Internet communications.\nIts members include major CAs like DigiCert and GlobalSign, as well as browser vendors such as Google, Apple, Mozilla, and Microsoft.\nEarlier this year,\nApple proposed\na motion to reduce certificate lifespans, which Sectigo, the Google Chrome team, and Mozilla endorsed.\nThis proposal would gradually reduce the lifespan of certificates over the next four years from its current 398-day lifespan to 47 days in March 2029.\nThe goal is to minimize risks from outdated certificate data, deprecated cryptographic algorithms, and prolonged exposure to compromised credentials. It also encourages companies and developers to utilize automation to renew and rotate TLS certificates, making it less likely that sites will be running on expired certificates.\nSSL/TLS certificates are digital files that enable secure communication over the internet (HTTPS) by encrypting data and authenticating websites.\nThey encrypt the connection so sensitive data like passwords and credit card data entered on website forms cannot be intercepted by attackers in the middle.\nThese certificates are also used to authenticate the website and guarantee data integrity, meaning the information exchanged between the user and the server hasn't been tampered with.\nWhen those certificates expire without renewal, users see a warning on their browser informing them that their connection isn't private or secure.\nCurrently, the lifespan and the Domain Control Validation (DCV) of those certificates is 398 days, but the majority of certificate authorities agreed that this is too long in today's security landscape.\nWith\n25 votes for and none against\n, the CA/Browser Forum has now ruled to shorten the lifespan as follows:\nFrom March 15, 2026\n, certificate lifespan and DCV will be reduced to 200 days\nFrom March 15, 2027\n, certificate lifespan and DCV will be reduced to 100 days\nFrom March 15, 2029\n, the certificate lifespan will be reduced to 47 days and DCV to 10 days\nShortening the certificate lifecycle is bound to introduce management overhead and add a large burden for people who handle multiple domains. However, it is expected to force more frequent revalidation of companies requesting certificates, encourage automation, and ultimately make the ecosystem more agile and secure.\nThis gradual shortening of certificate lifespans gives impacted entities enough time to implement and transition to automated certificate renewal systems, such as those offered by cloud providers, Let's Encrypt, or certificate providers that support the ACME protocol.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nEnhancing your DevSecOps with Wazuh, the open source XDR platform\nHackers target SSRF bugs in EC2-hosted sites to steal AWS credentials\nWho's calling?

At the same time, it also adds itself to filesystem locations like 'Startup,' 'Program Files,' and 'LocalAppData.'\nRegistry-based persistence\nSource: Morphisec\nResolverRAT attempts to connect at scheduled callbacks at random intervals to evade detection based on irregular beaconing patterns.\nEvery command sent by the operators is handled in a dedicated thread, enabling parallel task execution while ensuring failed commands don't crash the malware.\nThough Morphisec doesn't delve into the commands ResolverRAT supports, it mentions data exfiltration capabilities with a chunking mechanism for large data transfers.\nSpecifically, files larger than 1MB are split into 16KB chunks, which helps evade detection by blending the malicious traffic with normal patterns.\nBreaking larger files into chunks\nSource: Morphisec\nBefore sending each chunk, ResolverRAT checks if the socket is ready to write, preventing errors from congested or unstable networks.\nThe mechanism features optimal error handling and data recovery, resuming transfers from the last successful chunk.\nMorphisec observed phishing attacks in Italian, Czech, Hindi, Turkish, Portuguese, and Indonesia, so the malware has a global operational scope that could be expanded to include more countries.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft: New RAT malware used for crypto theft, reconnaissance\nWe Smell a (DC)Rat: Revealing a Sophisticated Malware Delivery Chain\nNew Crocodilus malware steals Android users’ crypto wallet keys\nKidney dialysis firm DaVita hit by weekend ransomware attack\nUS lab testing provider exposed health data of 1.6 million people"

A critical aspect of DevSecOps is scanning applications for vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.\nTo support this, teams need to implement several steps that enhance security monitoring and help aggregate security events from the tools and infrastructure within the pipeline.\nThese steps include:\n1. Monitor CI/CD tools:\nThis includes the systems and tools for building, testing, and deploying software, such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, and CircleCI. By continuously monitoring these tools, teams can detect security threats early and strengthen the overall security of a development pipeline.\n2. Monitor the infrastructure hosting your CI/CD platform:\nThis includes the host environment where the developed software and its infrastructure run. Examples include cloud platforms, on-premise servers, and container orchestration systems like Kubernetes. Ensuring these environments are secure helps prevent unauthorized access and system compromise.\nWazuh is an open source SIEM and XDR platform that provides out-of-the-box capabilities to improve DevSecOps. Wazuh helps organizations monitor and protect their infrastructure by collecting and analyzing logs, detecting threats, and identifying vulnerabilities across endpoints, servers, cloud environments, and applications.\nSeveral highlights of how Wazuh improves DevSecOps processes are described below.\nEnhancing your DevSecOps with Wazuh, the open source XDR platform\nDevSecOps, short for Development, Security, and Operations, is a methodology that integrates security practices into software Development Operations (DevOps). It emphasizes that security should be a shared responsibility across development, operations, and security teams rather than an isolated phase at the end of the software development lifecycle.\nBy including security from the start, DevSecOps ensures that applications are built, tested, and deployed with security in mind, reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing overall system resilience.\nLearn More\nMonitor CI/CD tools\nCI/CD tools are platforms and services that automate integrating, testing, and deploying code changes, helping software development workflows. Examples of such tools include GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and Jenkins, which automate different stages of the development pipeline.\nDocker, while not a CI/CD tool itself, is commonly used in CI/CD workflows to create reproducible environments for testing and deployment.\nWazuh has out-of-the-box capabilities for monitoring your CI/CD tools, including GitHub Actions and Docker. You can expand these capabilities by integrating your Wazuh deployment with third-party application development security solutions. The following section shows examples.\nAutomating security scans for your software environment\nImplementing automated security scans for your software environment ensures vulnerabilities are detected and addressed early in the development lifecycle, reducing risks before deployment. The post on\nintegrating Wazuh with DefectDojo\nshows one way of achieving this.\nDefectDojo collects findings from multiple application security solutions, while Wazuh aggregates these findings across multiple CI/CD environments.\nThe\nWazuh-Snyk integration\nis another example of implementing security monitoring in your software development/runtime environment, particularly containerized environments. Using the Wazuh command module, you can schedule Snyk CLI scans on Docker images.\nThese scans detect vulnerabilities, and the findings are forwarded to the Wazuh server for further analysis. This process enables early detection and remediation of security flaws within your application development lifecycle.\nMonitoring security in your code repository\nYou can also configure Wazuh to monitor activities performed in your repository. The\nmonitoring GitHub\ndocumentation provides a guide on how to configure Wazuh to monitor GitHub activities, such as:\nAccess to your organization or repository settings.\nChanges in repository permissions.\nUser addition or removal in an organization, repository, or team.\nGitHub events such as cloning, fetching, and pushing.\nMonitor the infrastructure hosting your CI/CD platform\nWazuh includes out-of-the-box capabilities for monitoring the infrastructure that runs your software development environment. These capabilities include vulnerability detection, file integrity monitoring, log analysis, security configuration assessment, and more.\nThe section below covers two capabilities that improve your DevSecOps processes.\nDetecting vulnerabilities in your infrastructure\nWazuh detects vulnerabilities across endpoints and applications using its Vulnerability Detector module and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) repository. The Wazuh CTI provides context on known attack patterns, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and exploit tactics.\nLeveraging the Wazuh threat intelligence feeds helps security teams identify, assess, and respond to evolving risks before they can be exploited.\nEnsuring compliance with security and compliance frameworks\nWazuh simplifies compliance management by monitoring systems for misconfigurations, policy violations, and security risks that could impact regulatory adherence. It provides built-in rules and audit capabilities for PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, NIST, and TSC frameworks.\nWazuh helps organizations meet regulatory requirements by leveraging its log analysis, file integrity monitoring, and vulnerability detection capabilities.\nThese features enable continuous monitoring for security risks and policy violations, allowing organizations to improve their security posture across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments.\nConclusion\nWazuh centralizes security insights from infrastructure, applications, and containerized environments to enhance threat detection and response. It offers built-in compliance reporting, integrates with third-party solutions, and leverages threat intelligence.\nThese capabilities help security teams prioritize risk management, strengthen security posture, and comply with industry regulations.\nAs DevSecOps practices continue to evolve, Wazuh offers a flexible, open source platform that integrates security throughout the development and operations lifecycle.\nStart using Wazuh\ntoday to strengthen your DevSecOps strategy, gain real-time security insights, generate compliance reports, and detect vulnerabilities before exploitation.\nSponsored and written by\nWazuh\n."

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nTrend Micro researchers flagging problems with Nvidia’s patch for a critical, code execution vulnerability in the Nvidia Container Toolkit.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nSecurity researchers at Trend Micro are flagging problems with Nvidia’s patch for a critical vulnerability in the Nvidia Container Toolkit, warning that the incomplete mitigation leaves enterprises exposed to container escape attacks.\nThe flaw, tagged as CVE-2024-0132 with a CVSS score of 9/10, was patched last September as a high-priority issue but now comes word from Trend Micro that the patch is “incomplete” and left the door ajar for hackers to execute arbitrary commands, compromise sensitive data, or escalate privileges on an affected system.\n\n\n\nAccording to Trend Micro’s analysis, a specially crafted container can exploit the TOCTOU timing window between when a container’s access to the host file system is checked and when the access is actually executed. \n\n\n\nThis gap allows an attacker to inject operations that bypass the intended isolation, effectively letting the container access or manipulate host resources. The oversight here lies in the patch’s inability to enforce strict checks that would preclude this race condition in the container’s runtime, Trend Micro explained.\n\n\n\n“Exploiting these vulnerabilities could enable attackers to access sensitive host data or cause significant operational disruption by exhausting host resources,” Trend Micro said in its documentation of the faulty patch.\n\n\n\n“Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive host data, theft of proprietary AI models or intellectual property, severe operational disruptions, and prolonged downtime due to resource exhaustion or system inaccessibility.”\n\n\n\nThe security company said organizations utilizing the NVIDIA Container Toolkit or Docker in AI, cloud, or containerized environments are directly affected, particularly those using default configurations or specific toolkit features introduced in recent versions. \n\n\n\n“Companies deploying AI workloads or Docker-based container infrastructure are potentially at risk,” the company added.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nAccording to Trend Micro’s analysis, versions up to 1.17.3 of the toolkit are inherently vulnerable, while version 1.17.4 requires an explicit enabling of the feature allow-cuda-compat-libs-from-container to be exploitable. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Trend Micro said it uncovered an adjacent denial-of-service flaw linked to Docker on Linux systems. Containers configured with multiple mounts using bind-propagation (specifically those with the shared flag) could trigger unchecked growth in the Linux mount table. \n\n\n\nTrend Micro said the resulting exhaustion of file descriptors poses a serious denial-of-service risk, effectively stalling container creation and denying remote connectivity via SSH.\n\n\n\nThe company is urging enterprise users to limit the Docker API to authorized personnel only and avoid unnecessary root-level privileges and to disable optional features in the NVIDIA Container Toolkit unless they are strictly required. \n\n\n\nAccording to documentation from cloud security vendor Wiz, the flaw threatens more than 35% of cloud environments using Nvidia GPUs, allowing attackers to escape containers and take control of the underlying host system. The impact is far-reaching, given the prevalence of Nvidia’s GPU solutions in both cloud and on-premises AI operations.\n\n\n\nRelated: Critical Nvidia Flaw Exposes Cloud AI Systems to Host Takeover\nRelated: Nvidia Patches High-Severity Vulnerabilities in AI, Networking Products\nRelated: Nvidia Patches High-Severity GPU Driver Vulnerabilities\nRelated: Code Execution Flaws Haunt NVIDIA ChatRTX for Windows\nRelated: SAP AI Core Flaws Allowed Service Takeover, Customer Data Access\n\nThe flaw, tagged as CVE-2024-0132 with a CVSS score of 9/10, was patched last September as a high-priority issue but now comes word from Trend Micro that the patch is “incomplete” and left the door ajar for hackers to execute arbitrary commands, compromise sensitive data, or escalate privileges on an affected system.\n\n\n\nAccording to Trend Micro’s analysis, a specially crafted container can exploit the TOCTOU timing window between when a container’s access to the host file system is checked and when the access is actually executed. \n\n\n\nThis gap allows an attacker to inject operations that bypass the intended isolation, effectively letting the container access or manipulate host resources.

Overall, they generated 205,474 unique fictitious package names. Most of the hallucinated packages (81%) were unique to the model that generated them.\n\n\n\nFor commercial models, hallucinated packages occurred in at least 5.2% of cases, and the percentage jumped to 21.7% for open source models. These hallucinations are often persistent within the same model, as 58% would repeat within 10 iterations.\n\n\n\n\nThe academics also warn that, while the risk of LLMs recommending malicious or typosquatted packages has been documented before, it was considered low, and that the concept of package hallucinations was not considered. With the rapid evolution of Gen-AI, the risks linked to its use have also escalated.\n\n\n\nThe researchers conducted 30 tests (16 for Python and 14 for JavaScript) to produce a total of 576,000 code samples. During evaluation, the models were prompted twice for package names, resulting in a total of 1,152,000 package prompts.Advertisement.
