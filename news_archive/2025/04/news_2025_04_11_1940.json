However, customers who have never enabled SSL-VPN are not impacted by the issue.\nIt's not clear who is behind the activity, but Fortinet said its investigation indicated that it was not aimed at any specific region or industry. It also said it directly notified customers who were affected by the issue.\nAs further mitigations to prevent such problems from happening again, a series of software updates to FortiOS have been rolled out -\nFortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4 - The symlink was flagged as malicious so that it gets automatically removed by the antivirus engine\nFortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16 - The symlink was removed and SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links\nCustomers are advised to update their instances to FortiOS versions 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16, review device configurations, and treat all configurations as potentially compromised and perform\nappropriate recovery steps\n.\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has\nissued\nan advisory of its own, urging users to reset exposed credentials and consider disabling SSL-VPN functionality until the patches can be applied. The Computer Emergency Response Team of France (CERT-FR), in a similar bulletin,\nsaid\nit's aware of compromises dating all the way back to early 2023.\nIn a statement shared with The Hacker News, watchTowr CEO Benjamin Harris said the incident is a concern for two important reasons.\n\"First, in the wild exploitation is becoming significantly faster than organizations can patch,\" Harris said. \"More importantly, attackers are demonstrably and deeply aware of this fact.\"\n\"Second, and more terrifying, we have seen, numerous times, attackers deploy capabilities and backdoors after rapid exploitation designed to survive the patching, upgrade and factory reset processes organizations have come to rely on to mitigate these situations to maintain persistence and access to compromised organizations.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The threat actor known as\nPaper Werewolf\nhas been observed exclusively targeting Russian entities with a new implant called\nPowerModul\n.\nThe activity, which took place between July and December 2024, singled out organizations in the mass media, telecommunications, construction, government entities, and energy sectors, Kaspersky\nsaid\nin a new report published Thursday.\nPaper Werewolf, also known as GOFFEE, is\nassessed\nto have conducted at least seven campaigns since 2022, according to BI.ZONE, with the attacks mainly aimed at government, energy, financial, media, and other organizations.\nAttack chains mounted by the threat actor have also been observed incorporating a disruptive component, wherein the intrusions go beyond distributing malware for espionage purposes to also change passwords belonging to employee accounts.\nThe attacks themselves are initiated via phishing emails that contain a macro-laced lure document, which, upon opening and enabling macros, paves the way for the deployment of a PowerShell-based remote access trojan known as\nPowerRAT\n.\nThe malware is designed to deliver a next-stage payload, often a custom version of the\nMythic\nframework agent known as\nPowerTaskel\nand\nQwakMyAgent\n. Another tool in the threat actor's arsenal is a malicious IIS module called\nOwowa\n, which is used for retrieving Microsoft Outlook credentials entered by users on the web client.\nThe latest set of attacks documented by Kaspersky starts with a malicious RAR archive attachment containing an executable that masquerades as a PDF or a Word document using a double extension (i.e., *.pdf.exe or *.doc.exe). When the executable is launched, the decoy file is downloaded from a remote server and shown to the user, while the infection proceeds to the next stage in the background.\n\"The file itself is a Windows system file (explorer.exe or xpsrchvw.exe), with part of its code patched with a malicious shellcode,\" it said. \"The shellcode is similar to what we saw in earlier attacks, but in addition contains an obfuscated Mythic agent, which immediately begins communicating with the command-and-control (C2) server.\"\nThe alternate attack sequence is a lot more elaborate, using a RAR archive embedding a Microsoft Office document with a macro that acts as a dropper to deploy and launch PowerModul, a PowerShell script capable of receiving and executing additional PowerShell scripts from the C2 server.\nThe backdoor is said to have been used since the start of 2024, with the threat actors initially using it to download and execute PowerTaskel on compromised hosts. Some of the other payloads dropped by PowerModul are listed below -\nFlashFileGrabber\n, which is used to steal files from removable media, such as flash drives, and exfiltrate them to the C2 server\nFlashFileGrabberOffline\n, a variant of FlashFileGrabber that searches removable media for files with specific extensions, and when found, copies them to the local disk within the \"%TEMP%\\CacheStore\\connect\\\" folder\nUSB Worm\n, which is capable of infecting removable media with a copy of PowerModul\nPowerTaskel is functionally similar to PowerModul in that it's also designed to run PowerShell scripts sent by the C2 server. But in addition, it can send information about the targeted environment in the form of a \"checkin\" message, as well as execute other commands received from the C2 server as tasks. It's also equipped to escalate privileges using the PsExec utility.\nIn at least one instance, PowerTaskel has been found to receive a script with a FolderFileGrabber component that, besides replicating the features of FlashFileGrabber, includes the ability to gather files from remote systems via a hardcoded network path using the SMB protocol.\n\"For the first time, they employed Word documents with malicious VBA scripts for initial infection,\" Kaspersky said. \"Recently, we have observed that GOFFEE is increasingly abandoning the use of PowerTaskel in favor of the binary Mythic agent during lateral movement.\"\nThe development comes as BI.ZONE\nattributed\nanother threat group called\nSapphire Werewolf\nto a phishing campaign that distributes an updated version of the open-source Amethyst Stealer.\nThe stealer retrieves \"credentials from Telegram and various browsers, including Chrome, Opera, Yandex, Brave, Orbitum, Atom, Kometa, and Edge Chromium, as well as FileZilla and SSH configuration files,\" the Russian company said, adding it can also grab documents, including those stored on removable media.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "What are IABs?\nInitial Access Brokers (IABs) specialize in gaining unauthorized entry into computer systems and networks, then selling that access to other cybercriminals. This division of labor allows IABs to concentrate on their core expertise: exploiting vulnerabilities through methods like social engineering and brute-force attacks.\nBy selling access, they significantly mitigate the risks associated with directly executing ransomware attacks or other complex operations. Instead, they capitalize on their skill in breaching networks, effectively streamlining the attack process for their clients.\nThis business model enables IABs to operate with a lower profile and reduced risk, while still profiting from their technical skills. Operating primarily on dark web forums and underground markets, IABs can function independently or as part of larger organizations like Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) gangs.\nThey act as a crucial link in the cybercrime ecosystem, providing the initial foothold needed for ransomware gangs, data thieves, and other malicious actors to carry out their operations. The pricing of their services is dependent on the target's size, the level of access granted, and the perceived value of the compromised system, typically conducted within the dark web.\nWhy are IABs gaining steam?\nThe rising prominence of Initial Access Brokers (IABs) is directly tied to their ability to streamline and accelerate ransomware operations, particularly Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) schemes. By handling the complex task of initial network infiltration, IABs allow ransomware groups to focus solely on data encryption and extortion, effectively scaling their attack capabilities.\nThis efficiency is further amplified by the growing trend of IABs working directly for RaaS affiliates, enabling near-instantaneous attacks upon access procurement, eliminating the time-consuming process of establishing a foothold.\nThis symbiotic relationship benefits both sides. RaaS groups gain speed and efficiency, while IABs secure a consistent stream of work, often bypassing the need for public advertising on dark web forums.\nThis reduced visibility provides a layer of protection from law enforcement scrutiny, as their activities are less exposed compared to those operating on open marketplaces. This combination of increased operational efficiency for ransomware groups and reduced risk for IABs has fueled the rapid expansion and influence of IABs within the cyber crime ecosystem.\nWhere are IABs focusing?\nIn 2023, the business services sector was clearly the most targeted industry, although it is still in the top 3 in 2024 with 13% there is a much wider spread of industries being targeted. Whereas in 2023 the business services sector took up a whopping 29% of attacks, that number stood at just 13% in 2024. The same is true for the other industries showing diminished percentages. This could be due to IABs broadening the industries that they are targeting.\nAs usual the USA is a prime target, for its economic and technological power making high value targets. Notably, Brazil and France secured the second and third spots respectively, indicating high value targets in both countries.\nTo see what types of businesses are being targeted in more depth\nread our guide to IABs here.\nThe Financial Motives of IABs\nThe Initial Access Broker (IAB) market demonstrates a dynamic pricing structure, generally offering corporate access between $500 and $3,000. While 2023 saw an average listing price of $1,979, skewed by occasional high-value targets reaching tens of thousands of dollars, the median price remained significantly lower at $1,000, with a majority of listings below $3,000.\nIn 2024, cybercriminals are increasingly targeting smaller victims. While they've generally lowered the prices for selling access to hacked systems, with 86% costing under $3,000, the\naverage\nprice has actually gone up to $2,047. This higher average is misleading because a few very expensive sales are skewing the number.\nAs the chart shows, the vast majority (58%) of access deals now cost less than $1,000 – a big change from 2023. Furthermore, expensive access options are less common, now making up only 7% of what's for sale.\nThis strategic price reduction, coupled with a decrease in high-value listings, suggests a change in IAB tactics. They are now focusing on volume, offering numerous lower-priced access points that, in aggregate, can yield substantial financial gains.\nDespite the lower individual prices, the sheer quantity of available access points poses a significant threat, potentially causing widespread damage and proving more lucrative than a smaller number of high-priced sales. This shift indicates an evolution in the IAB market, prioritizing accessibility and volume over individual high-value transactions.\nTo see detailed information on the TTPs being used by IABs,\nread our guide here.\nWhat's next for IABs?\nThe rise of Initial Access Brokers (IABs) is driven by a confluence of factors that enhance the efficiency and profitability of cyber crime. Their specialization in initial network infiltration allows ransomware groups and other malicious actors to focus on later stages of attacks, streamlining operations and increasing the scale of potential damage.\nThe growing trend of direct collaboration between IABs and Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) affiliates further accelerates attack timelines, creating a more efficient and dangerous cyber criminal ecosystem.\nThe evolution of IAB pricing strategies also reveals a significant shift in tactics. IABs are increasingly focusing on volume, offering numerous lower-priced access. This strategy maximizes potential financial gains by providing a wider range of attack vectors, making cyber crime more accessible and potentially more damaging.\nThis shift, coupled with the reduced visibility afforded by operating outside of public dark web forums, provides IABs with a significant layer of protection from law enforcement.\nLooking ahead, we can expect IABs to continue playing a pivotal role in the cyber crime landscape. Their ability to provide readily available access points will likely fuel the growth of ransomware and other financially motivated attacks. The trend towards lower-priced, high-volume access sales suggests that smaller organizations, previously considered less attractive targets, will face increasing risk.\nFurthermore as IABs mature their tactics, and strengthen ties with RaaS affiliates, the speed and efficiency of cyber attacks will continue to increase. Therefore, proactive cyber security measures, including threat intelligence on up to date TTPs, continuous monitoring, and employee training, will become increasingly critical in mitigating the growing threat posed by IABs.\nFor detailed insights into contemporary IAB tactics, including access types, privilege usage, and recommended protective measures, consult the\ncomprehensive IAB guide\nor attend our talk at this year's RSA conference by Adi Bleih, Security Researcher titled\nInitial Access Brokers – A Deep Dive\non April 30th at 2:25pm in HT-W09.\nYou can add it to your schedule here\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

In May 2024, the malware was\npropagated\nvia another bogus site impersonating a legitimate antivirus solution known as Avast.\nSubsequent analysis by mobile security firm Zimperium has\nunearthed\nsimilarities between SpyNote and Gigabud, raising the possibility that the same threat actor or actors are behind the two malware families. Gigabud is attributed to a Chinese-speaking threat actor codenamed\nGoldFactory\n.\nOver the years, SpyNote has also seen some level of adoption by state-sponsored hacking groups, such as\nOilAlpha\nand\nother\nunknown actors\n.\nThe clone websites identified by DTI include a carousel of images that, when clicked, download a malicious APK file onto the user's device. The package file acts as a dropper to install a second embedded APK payload via the\nDialogInterface.OnClickListener interface\nthat allows for the execution of the SpyNote malware when an item in a dialog box is clicked.\n\"Upon installation, it aggressively requests numerous intrusive permissions, gaining extensive control over the compromised device,\" DTI said.\n\"This control allows for the theft of sensitive data such as SMS messages, contacts, call logs, location information, and files. SpyNote also boasts significant remote access capabilities, including camera and microphone activation, call manipulation, and arbitrary command execution.\"\nThe disclosure comes as Lookout revealed that it observed over 4 million mobile-focused social engineering attacks in 2024, with 427,000 malicious apps detected on enterprise devices and 1,600,000 vulnerable app detections during the time period.\n\"Over the course of the last five years, iOS users have been exposed to significantly more phishing attacks than Android users,\" Lookout\nsaid\n. \"2024 was the first year where iOS devices were exposed more than twice as much as Android devices.\"\nIntel Agencies Warn of BadBazaar and MOONSHINE\nThe findings also follow a joint advisory issued by cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States about the targeting of Uyghur, Taiwanese, and Tibetan communities using malware families such as BadBazaar and MOONSHINE.\nTargets of the campaign include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), journalists, businesses, and civil society members who advocate for or represent these groups. \"The indiscriminate way this spyware is spread online also means there is a risk that infections could spread beyond intended victims,\" the agencies\nsaid\n.\nA subset of app icons used by samples of the MOONSHINE surveillance tool as of January 2024\nBoth\nBadBazaar and MOONSHINE\nare classified as trojans that are capable of gathering sensitive data from Android and iOS devices, including locations, messages, photos, and files. They are typically distributed via apps that are passed off as messaging, utilities, or religious apps.\nBadBazaar was\nfirst documented\nby Lookout in November 2022, although campaigns distributing the malware are assessed to have been ongoing as early as 2018. MOONSHINE, on the other hand, was recently put to use by a threat actor dubbed\nEarth Minotaur\nto facilitate long-term surveillance operations aimed at Tibetans and Uyghurs.\nThe use of\nBadBazaar\nhas been tied to a Chinese hacking group tracked as\nAPT15\n, which is also known as Flea, Nylon Typhoon (formerly Nickel), Playful Taurus, Royal APT, and Vixen Panda.\n\"While the iOS variant of BadBazaar has relatively limited capabilities versus its Android counterpart, it still has the ability to exfiltrate personal data from the victim's device,\" Lookout\nsaid\nin a report published in January 2024. \"Evidence suggests that it was primarily targeted at the Tibetan community within China.\"\nAccording to the cybersecurity company, data collected from the victims' devices via MOONSHINE is exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled infrastructure that can be accessed via a so-called SCOTCH ADMIN panel, which displays details of compromised devices and the level of access to each of them. As of January 2024, 635 devices were logged across three SCOTCH ADMIN panels.\nIn a related development, Swedish authorities have\narrested\nDilshat Reshit, a Uyghur resident of Stockholm, on suspicion of spying on fellow members of the community in the country.

        "Content": "Fortinet warns that threat actors use a post-exploitation technique that helps them maintain read-only access to previously compromised FortiGate VPN devices even after the original attack vector was patched.\nEarlier this week, Fortinet began sending emails to customers warning that their FortiGate/FortiOS devices were compromised based on telemetry received from FortiGuard devices.\nThese emails were titled \"Notification of device compromise - FortiGate / FortiOS - ** Urgent action required **,\" given a TLP:AMBER+STRICT designation.\n\"This issue is not related to any new vulnerability. This file was left behind by a threat actor following exploitation of previous known vulnerabilities,\" the emails said, including but not limited to\nCVE-2022-42475\n,\nCVE-2023-27997\n, and\nCVE-2024-21762\n.\nAfter BleepingComputer contacted Fortinet with questions about these emails, the company released an advisory on Thursday warning about this new exploitation technique. The advisory says that when the threat actors previously breached servers using older vulnerabilities, they created symbolic links in the language files folder to the root file system on devices with SSL-VPN enabled.\nThis allows them to maintain read-only access to the root filesystem through the publicly accessible SSL-VPN web panel even after they're discovered and evicted.\n\"A threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection,\"\nFortinet says\n.\n\"Therefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device's file system, which may include configurations.\"\nEmails sent to owners of compromised devices (BleepingComputer)\n​Attacks go back to early 2023\nWhile Fortinet didn't reveal the exact timeframe of these attacks, the Computer Emergency Response Team of France (CERT-FR), part of the country's National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI), revealed on Thursday that this technique has been used in a massive wave of attacks going back to early 2023.\n\"CERT-FR is aware of a massive campaign involving numerous compromised devices in France. During incident response operations, CERT-FR has learned of compromises occurring since early 2023,\"\nCERT-FR said\n.\nToday, CISA also advised network defenders to\nreport any incidents and anomalous activity\nrelated to Fortinet's report to its 24/7 Operations Center at Report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870.\nIn the emails sent earlier this week, Fortinet advised customers to immediately upgrade their FortiGuard firewalls to the latest version of FortiOS (7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11, 7.0.17, 6.4.16) to remove the malicious files used for persistence.\nAdmins were also urged to review device configurations immediately and focus on finding any unexpected changes.\nThis support document\nprovides further guidance on resetting potentially exposed credentials on compromised devices.\nCERT-FR also recommended isolating compromised VPN devices from the network, resetting all secrets (credentials, certificates, identity tokens, cryptographic keys, etc), and searching for evidence of lateral network movement.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft: Windows 'inetpub' folder created by security fix, don’t delete\nCritical FortiSwitch flaw lets hackers change admin passwords remotely\nNew SuperBlack ransomware exploits Fortinet auth bypass flaws\nWinRAR flaw bypasses Windows Mark of the Web security alerts\nIvanti: VPN appliances vulnerable if pushing configs after mitigation"

        "Content": "Microsoft has now confirmed that an April 2025 Windows security update is creating a new empty \"inetpub\" folder and warned users not to delete it.\nThis folder is typically used by Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS), a web server platform that can be enabled via the Windows Features dialog to host websites and web apps.\nHowever, after installing this month's cumulative updates, many Windows users have found a newly created C:\\inetpub folder on their systems, although IIS wasn't installed during the process.\nBleepingComputer\nhas confirmed this behavior\non our Windows 11 and Windows 10 systems and discovered that the cumulative update creates the folder using the SYSTEM account.\nEven though deleting the folder did not cause issues using Windows in our tests, Microsoft told BleepingComputer on Thursday that this empty folder had been intentionally created and should not be removed.\nHowever, according to\nuser reports\n, the April cumulative updates\nwill fail to install\nif the C:\\inetpub directory is created before update deployment.\nUsers warned not to remove the new folder\nWhile Redmond still has to explain why the security updates are creating this folder in the first place, the company updated the advisory for a Windows Process Activation elevation of privilege vulnerability (tracked as\nCVE-2025-21204\n) overnight to warn users not to delete the new empty inetpub folder on their hard drives.\n\"After installing the updates listed in the Security Updates table for your operating system, a new %systemdrive%\\inetpub folder will be created on your device,\"\nMicrosoft says\n.\n\"This folder should not be deleted regardless of whether Internet Information Services (IIS) is active on the target device. This behavior is part of changes that increase protection and does not require any action from IT admins and end users.\"\nThe CVE-2025-21204 security flaw is caused by an improper link resolution issue before file access ('link following') in the Windows Update Stack which likely means that, on unpatched devices, Windows Update may follow symbolic links in a way that can let local attackers trick the system into accessing or modifying unintended files or folders.\nThe company warns that successful exploitation can let local attackers with low privileges escalate permissions and \"perform and/or manipulate file management operations on the victim machine in the context of the NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM account.\"\nHow to recreate the C:\\inetpub folder\nFor those who deleted the inetpub folder, you can recreate it by going into the Windows \"Turn Windows Features on or off\" control panel and installing Internet Information Services.\nOnce installed, a new inetpub folder will be created in the root of the C: drive, this time with files in it. However, it will have the same SYSTEM ownership as the folder created by the recent Windows security update.\nIf you do not use IIS, you can uninstall it again through the same Windows Features control panel and reboot your computer when prompted.\nThis will remove the software but leave the C:\\inetpub folder behind.\nMicrosoft has confirmed that this method will recreate the folder with the same protections.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft April 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes exploited zero-day, 134 flaws\nMicrosoft adds hotpatching support to Windows 11 Enterprise\nMicrosoft March 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes 7 zero-days, 57 flaws\nMicrosoft February 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes 4 zero-days, 55 flaws\nWindows 11 KB5055523 & KB5055528  cumulative updates released"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nThe CVE-2025-22457 has already been exploited by a China-nexus hacking gang notorious for breaking into edge network devices.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nSecurity researchers at Rapid7 are publicly documenting a path to remote code execution of a critical flaw in Ivanti’s Connect Secure VPN appliances, ramping up the urgency for organizations to apply available patches.\nThe publication of exploit code comes less than a week after Mandiant flagged in-the-wild exploitation of the Ivanti bug (CVE-2025-22457) by a Chinese hacking gang notorious for hacking into edge network devices.\n\n\n\nAlthough the issue was patched back in February, Ivanti misdiagnosed the issue as a so-called “product bug” and failed to issue a CVE identifier with public documentation. It wasn’t until Mandiant’s incident response team discovered the Chinese hacking campaign that Ivanti pushed out an advisory with details on the problem.\n\n\n\nHere’s Ivanti’s explanation of the hiccup:\n\n\n\n“The vulnerability is a buffer overflow with characters limited to periods and numbers, it was evaluated and determined not to be exploitable as remote code execution and didn’t meet the requirements of denial of service.” \n“However, Ivanti and our security partners have now learned the vulnerability is exploitable through sophisticated means and have identified evidence of active exploitation in the wild. We encourage all customers to ensure they are running Ivanti Connect Secure 22.7R2.6 as soon as possible, which remediates the vulnerability.” \nA week after the public disclosure, Rapid7s researchers warn that attackers can use a few carefully crafted HTTP headers to escalate the exploit from a trivial crash to full-blown remote code execution.\n\n\n\nAccording to Rapid7’s technical analysis, the vulnerability stems from an unchecked buffer overflow in the HTTP(S) web server component of the Ivanti Connect Secure software. The researchers traced the vulnerability to a function that processes the “X-Forwarded-For” header and by  manipulating the length of the header value, they were able to trigger an overflow that overwrites key parts of the stack. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“This is a salient reminder that state-sponsored threat actors are actively reverse engineering vendor patches for high-profile software targets, and are able to identify silently patched (or otherwise not publicly disclosed) vulnerabilities,” Rapid7 warned.\n\n\n\n“For reference, it took us approximately 4 business days of work to go from an initial crash to RCE,” the company added.\n\n\n\n“State-sponsored threat actors have both significant time and expertise to develop nuanced and complex exploits against high-profile targets. This highlights what is arguably an asymmetry between threat actor resources and capabilities, and technology producer resources and capabilities when making impact judgments about potential security issues.”\n\n\n\nThe vulnerability, which carries a CVSS severity score of 9/10, affects Ivanti Connect Secure versions 22.7R2.5 and earlier, as well as end-of-support Pulse Connect Secure 9.x.\n\n\n\nBeyond Ivanti Connect Secure, Ivanti plans to release patches for its Policy Secure and ZTA Gateways. While the Policy Secure fix is slated for release on April 21 and the ZTA Gateways update on April 19, neither platform has yet been observed under active attack. \n\n\n\nIvanti customers are urged to update to Connect Secure version 22.7R2.6 without delay and to migrate away from unsupported Pulse Connect Secure appliances.   \n\n\n\nRapid7 has joined Ivanti in recommending that organizations examine appliances for web server crashes that offer a useful indication of attempted exploitation. \n\n\n\n“This is due to how the exploit, in lieu of a suitable info leak to break ASLR, must rely upon brute forcing an address of a shared object library in the web server process. Every failed attempt to guess the correct address will result in the web server process crashing, and subsequently restarting,” Rapid7 noted.\n\n\n\nRelated: CISA Sets 48-Hour Deadline for Removal of Insecure Ivanti Products\nRelated: Details on Ivanti Exploits Chains: What Network Defenders Need to Know\nRelated: Ivanti Warns of New Zero-Day Attacks Hitting Connect Secure Product \n\n\n\nRelated: Ivanti CEO Vows Cybersecurity Makeover After Zero-Day Blitz\nRelated: CISA Issues Emergency Directive on Ivanti Zero-Days\n\nThe publication of exploit code comes less than a week after Mandiant flagged in-the-wild exploitation of the Ivanti bug (CVE-2025-22457) by a Chinese hacking gang notorious for hacking into edge network devices.\n\n\n\nAlthough the issue was patched back in February, Ivanti misdiagnosed the issue as a so-called “product bug” and failed to issue a CVE identifier with public documentation.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nA vulnerability in the OttoKit WordPress plugin with over 100,000 active installations has been exploited in the wild.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThreat actors are actively exploiting a vulnerability in the OttoKit WordPress plugin, with many websites potentially exposed to complete compromise, WordPress security firm Defiant warns.\nFormerly named SureTriggers, ‘OttoKit: All-in-One Automation Platform’ is a plugin that enables website administrators to automate tasks, and connect applications, websites, and WordPress plugins.\n\n\n\nThe plugin has more than 100,000 active installations, putting all websites that use it at risk of takeover due to a high-severity authentication bypass that could allow attackers to create new administrator accounts.\n\n\n\nTracked as CVE-2025-3102 (CVSS score of 8.1), the issue exists due to a missing empty value check in a function that performs permission verifications.\n\n\n\nBecause the function only compares the secret key in the header with the one in the plugin’s database, an attacker can specify an empty value for the secret key and, if the plugin has not been configured, it will match the empty key value in the database.\n\n\n\nThis allows the attacker to access the REST API endpoint that handles different actions and perform various operations, including creating a new administrative account. This would provide the attacker with complete control of the affected site.\n\n\n\n“[The attacker could] then manipulate anything on the targeted site as a normal administrator would. This includes the ability to upload plugin and theme files, which can be malicious zip files containing backdoors, and modify posts and pages which can be leveraged to redirect site users to other malicious sites or inject spam content,” Defiant says.\n\n\n\nHowever, the security defect can only be exploited if the plugin has been installed and activated, but not configured with an API key, meaning that only new and unconfigured installations are susceptible to attacks.Advertisement.

This would provide the attacker with complete control of the affected site.\n\n\n\n“[The attacker could] then manipulate anything on the targeted site as a normal administrator would. This includes the ability to upload plugin and theme files, which can be malicious zip files containing backdoors, and modify posts and pages which can be leveraged to redirect site users to other malicious sites or inject spam content,” Defiant says.\n\n\n\nHowever, the security defect can only be exploited if the plugin has been installed and activated, but not configured with an API key, meaning that only new and unconfigured installations are susceptible to attacks.Advertisement.

Poor OPSEC enabled Outpost24 researchers to track the man’s life in recent years, but they have not made his name public. He was recently credited by Microsoft for responsibly disclosing two vulnerabilities. \n\n\n\nNeptune RAT steals passwords from 270 applications\nCyfirma has analyzed Neptune RAT, a remote access trojan targeting Windows systems with destructive capabilities and the ability to steal passwords from over 270 applications. The malware uses various persistence methods and anti-analysis techniques, and it also packs ransomware, cryptocurrency clipper, desktop monitoring, and anti-antivirus capabilities. Advertisement.

Google’s report focuses on how the attackers leveraged lesser-known RDP features to gain access to victims’ devices and exfiltrate data. The campaign was previously analyzed by Microsoft and AWS.\n\n\n\nWK Kellogg data breach\nFood giant WK Kellogg is notifying employees that their information may have been compromised in the Cleo attack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware group. It’s unclear how many people are impacted by the data breach, but the number may be low.

Unsurprisingly, the malware has been attributed to Chinese state-sponsored threat actors.\n\n\n\nSplunk and Palo Alto Networks patches\nSplunk has published 15 advisories describing the third-party package updates of April 2025. The updates mostly address critical- and high-severity vulnerabilities in Juniper, Microsoft, Symantec, and other components. \n\n\n\nPalo Alto Networks has published nearly a dozen new advisories. A majority of them address medium- and low-severity issues affecting Cortex XDR, PAN-OS, Prisma and GlobalProtect products. The security holes can allow command injection, DoS attacks, information disclosure, user impersonation, and privilege escalation. The security giant says there is no evidence of in-the-wild exploitation. \n\n\n\nScattered Spider still active despite arrests\nDespite several of its members being arrested and prosecuted, the Scattered Spider cybercrime group is still active. According to Silent Push, the hackers this year have targeted services such as Klaviyo, HubSpot, and Pure Storage, as well as brands such as Chick-fil-A, Forbes, Instacart, Louis Vuitton, Morningstar, News Corporation, Nike, X, Tinder, T-Mobile, and Vodafone.\n\n\n\nFortinet says hackers exploiting known vulnerabilities with new techniques\nFortinet has informed customers that threat actors have been observed exploiting known vulnerabilities “with a new technique to maintain read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices after the original access vector was locked down”.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nVery few people in the cybersecurity industry do not know, or know of, Bryson Bort, CEO/Founder of SCYTHE and the co-founder of ICS Village.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nVery few people in the cybersecurity industry do not know, or know of, Bryson Bort. Yes, he’s the CEO/Founder of SCYTHE, but he’s also the co-founder of ICS Village (the next one at RSA Conference from April 28 to May 1, 2025). This event, and all of our industry’s attention on critical infrastructure, is pivotal as it often comes down to a life-threatening situation if something were to go wrong. Read on for more about Bort, why he started SCYTHE, how that led him further down the ICS path, and be sure to check out ICS Village at RSAC.\n\n\n\nQ. Tell me about SCYTHE, what it does, and why you started it–and why the industry needs the offerings it provides.\nA. I started an offensive cybersecurity consultancy called GRIMM in 2013 after leaving the government. In 2016, Target came to us with a request to build a custom implant. I love the story of Target: their breach in 2013 created the modern cybersecurity ecosystem of organizational investment and market innovation we all enjoy now. Instead of it being a consulting project where we build a tool that trains their defense and we have to build another later, I proposed a platform that would allow you to scale any threat behavior that could ever exist on your terms—and SCYTHE was born. \n\n\n\nBryson Bort\nI realized I couldn’t do it alone and Ron Gula and Dmitri Alperovitch helped me raise and launch the company. The concept is simple: once a threat has breached you, they can only: 1) communicate with the protocols already in your environment to blend, 2) execute on computers you already have, 3) capabilities; only do so many things to accomplish their goals on those hosts. SCYTHE is an offensive box of Legos of communications and capabilities that allow you to no-code create anything a threat might do in your organization. This is key.\n\n\n\nCybersecurity is “hard” because it has to be yours. No one else can give the expert prescription at a distance for the right preventative and detective controls for you. Security is defined by the threat; it’s the only measurement that matters. Our platform allows companies to easily drive that understanding safely and easily across all teams with recommendations.\n\n\n\nQ. SCYTHE is not your first endeavor as an entrepreneur. Please tell me about your entrepreneurial journey and what advice you might give to would-be entrepreneurs.\nA. When I founded GRIMM, I learned that it’s not the idea you start with, but the agility to pivot. Which we first did by moving from specialized government work to commercial. When Target approached me in 2016 to help them build custom red team tooling, I realized it was a possible product and asked to keep the intellectual property while co-developing what became the SCYTHE platform with them for two years. Along the way, I realized I knew absolutely nothing about commercial software sales and development  which is why I reached out and expanded my network to learn. This led to Gula and Alperovitch helping me spin out SCYTHE from GRIMM. Then, I learned the hard lesson of Total Addressable Market (TAM). We were building a red team tool, there is no red team market; it’s a $3B market of in-house or outsourced experts with little budget beyond. So, we looked at how we could make it valuable outside of that scope and it’s why we were one of the leading initial proponents of purple teaming.\n\n\n\nThere are three key qualities to an entrepreneur (and being the smartest is not one of them!): risk tolerance, risk and reward of living or dying based on what you can do, and tolerance for pain. You are the chief executive officer (CEO) and the janitor for everything it takes to run this new endeavor.\n\n\n\nQ. How did you first get interested in cybersecurity? Why is it such a passion for you?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nA. Ever since I was little, I had a penchant for technology. I was able to take things apart, put them back together (most of the time), and personally explore the increasing involvement of computers in our lives. I wanted to understand the ins and outs of MS-DOS; I programmed complex games on my graphing calculator for fun when we had to use them in high school; and I wanted to break the protections on games so I could modify them to make them more interesting. “Cybersecurity” when I worked in information security as a cadet at West Point pretty much consisted of running around with golden disks whenever a virus struck, or patches needed to be rolled out and it wasn’t much more complex when I was an Army Officer.\n\n\n\nMy passion for cybersecurity comes from a lifelong passion for service and protection. Cybersecurity isn’t an esoteric nerd thing: it is the regular people trying to live their lives and be able to manage money; it is local schools, hospitals, and towns trying to provide a good quality of life for their citizens.\n\n\n\nQ. Tell me why the intense focus on industrial control systems (ICS) and why you co-founded ICS Village. It seems the focus on this has accelerated significantly in the last five years. Why?\nA. Most people only know industrial control systems as “Stuxnet” and, even then, with a limited idea of what exactly that means. These are the computers that run critical infrastructure, manufacturing plants, and dialysis machines in hospitals. A bad day with normal computers means ransomware where a business can’t run, espionage where a company loses valuable data, or a regular person getting scammed out of their bank account. All pretty bad, but at least everyone is still breathing. With ICS, a bad day can mean loss of life or limb and that’s just at the point of use. The downstream effects of water or electricity being disrupted sends us to the Stone Ages immediately and there is a direct correlation to loss of life in those scenarios.\n\n\n\nSimulated water plant constructed in ICS Village demonstrates hands-on learning experiences for different components of industrial control system security.\nI co-founded the ICS Village, a non-profit 501c3 with a mission to educate and build awareness for critical infrastructure security, with Tom VanNorman in 2017 because we both believe something needs to change. And for years, no one really cared. Then, Oldsmar happened (ironically, nothing actually happened, but it still got the right attention) and we had been demonstrating that attack for years on our custom-built water plant (pictured above). Then, Colonial Pipeline was the real game changer. As I wrote in a USA Today op-ed with Dr. Paul Rosenzweig, you definitely get the attention in a hydrocarbon-based (gas) economy where disruption affects daily life.\n\n\n\nQ.  Many career cyber folks can get myopic by only applying security solutions to the problems security practitioners face. Your approach is perceived as building a community that embraces security far beyond the industry. What makes this important?\nA. Together we will succeed, individually we will continue to struggle and fail.\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. The Law of N which is derivative of Dunbar’s Number, the limit of the number of people with which you can maintain good social relationships. The military is built on the organizational concept of squads, 4-10 soldiers, which allows the agility to respond to a rapidly changing environment with a cohesive team with the capability to drive those changes. Then, the unit scales up into platoons, companies, battalions, etc. As an officer, you learn how to manage at different echelons for a greater impact.\n\n\n\nAs an entrepreneur, it’s the same and the Law of N is the variable number of people that you can lead where you personally have a visible impact on their daily requirements. The second you hit N+1, it is another leader below you in the chain who now has that impact. In summary: 1) you can’t do it alone, being an individual contributor (no matter how talented) is never going to be as impactful as a squad/team; 2) the structure you build is going to dictate the success or failure of the execution of your ideas; and 3) you have leadership limits of what you can control.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, you do a lot of work and coaching with students and future cyber leaders. What advice do you specifically have for them?\nA. You are the next generation; you are the ones who are gonna pick up the mantle. Don’t fear AI. Humankind over and over again has had tools that disrupt, but with critical thinking and lifelong learning, you’ll master anything that comes, and you’ll still be in charge of it. Our society is growing increasingly dependent on you.\n\n\n\nCybersecurity is not just this thing where we can debate what’s happening in Ukraine; it’s happening here with multiple nations and bad actors all over the world trying to ruin our lives daily. They don’t care that you don’t work for the military or at the NSA; you and American citizens are fair game. You are the front lines where they’re attacking our schools, our cities, our homes, our hospitals. So, whether you do it on behalf of the government or not, you are the future of our national security. \nLearn More at SecurityWeek’s ICS Cybersecurity ConferenceThe leading global conference series for Operations, Control Systems and OT/IT Security professionals to connect on SCADA, DCS PLC and field controller cybersecurity.October 27-30, 2025 | Atlantawww.icscybersecurityconference.com\n\n\nQ.

When I founded GRIMM, I learned that it’s not the idea you start with, but the agility to pivot. Which we first did by moving from specialized government work to commercial. When Target approached me in 2016 to help them build custom red team tooling, I realized it was a possible product and asked to keep the intellectual property while co-developing what became the SCYTHE platform with them for two years. Along the way, I realized I knew absolutely nothing about commercial software sales and development  which is why I reached out and expanded my network to learn. This led to Gula and Alperovitch helping me spin out SCYTHE from GRIMM. Then, I learned the hard lesson of Total Addressable Market (TAM). We were building a red team tool, there is no red team market; it’s a $3B market of in-house or outsourced experts with little budget beyond. So, we looked at how we could make it valuable outside of that scope and it’s why we were one of the leading initial proponents of purple teaming.\n\n\n\nThere are three key qualities to an entrepreneur (and being the smartest is not one of them!): risk tolerance, risk and reward of living or dying based on what you can do, and tolerance for pain. You are the chief executive officer (CEO) and the janitor for everything it takes to run this new endeavor.\n\n\n\nQ. How did you first get interested in cybersecurity? Why is it such a passion for you?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nA. Ever since I was little, I had a penchant for technology. I was able to take things apart, put them back together (most of the time), and personally explore the increasing involvement of computers in our lives. I wanted to understand the ins and outs of MS-DOS; I programmed complex games on my graphing calculator for fun when we had to use them in high school; and I wanted to break the protections on games so I could modify them to make them more interesting. “Cybersecurity” when I worked in information security as a cadet at West Point pretty much consisted of running around with golden disks whenever a virus struck, or patches needed to be rolled out and it wasn’t much more complex when I was an Army Officer.\n\n\n\nMy passion for cybersecurity comes from a lifelong passion for service and protection. Cybersecurity isn’t an esoteric nerd thing: it is the regular people trying to live their lives and be able to manage money; it is local schools, hospitals, and towns trying to provide a good quality of life for their citizens.\n\n\n\nQ. Tell me why the intense focus on industrial control systems (ICS) and why you co-founded ICS Village. It seems the focus on this has accelerated significantly in the last five years. Why?\nA. Most people only know industrial control systems as “Stuxnet” and, even then, with a limited idea of what exactly that means. These are the computers that run critical infrastructure, manufacturing plants, and dialysis machines in hospitals. A bad day with normal computers means ransomware where a business can’t run, espionage where a company loses valuable data, or a regular person getting scammed out of their bank account. All pretty bad, but at least everyone is still breathing. With ICS, a bad day can mean loss of life or limb and that’s just at the point of use. The downstream effects of water or electricity being disrupted sends us to the Stone Ages immediately and there is a direct correlation to loss of life in those scenarios.\n\n\n\nSimulated water plant constructed in ICS Village demonstrates hands-on learning experiences for different components of industrial control system security.\nI co-founded the ICS Village, a non-profit 501c3 with a mission to educate and build awareness for critical infrastructure security, with Tom VanNorman in 2017 because we both believe something needs to change. And for years, no one really cared. Then, Oldsmar happened (ironically, nothing actually happened, but it still got the right attention) and we had been demonstrating that attack for years on our custom-built water plant (pictured above). Then, Colonial Pipeline was the real game changer. As I wrote in a USA Today op-ed with Dr. Paul Rosenzweig, you definitely get the attention in a hydrocarbon-based (gas) economy where disruption affects daily life.\n\n\n\nQ.  Many career cyber folks can get myopic by only applying security solutions to the problems security practitioners face. Your approach is perceived as building a community that embraces security far beyond the industry. What makes this important?\nA. Together we will succeed, individually we will continue to struggle and fail.\n\n\n\nQ.  What is the best advice that you’ve ever been given?\nA. The Law of N which is derivative of Dunbar’s Number, the limit of the number of people with which you can maintain good social relationships. The military is built on the organizational concept of squads, 4-10 soldiers, which allows the agility to respond to a rapidly changing environment with a cohesive team with the capability to drive those changes. Then, the unit scales up into platoons, companies, battalions, etc. As an officer, you learn how to manage at different echelons for a greater impact.\n\n\n\nAs an entrepreneur, it’s the same and the Law of N is the variable number of people that you can lead where you personally have a visible impact on their daily requirements. The second you hit N+1, it is another leader below you in the chain who now has that impact. In summary: 1) you can’t do it alone, being an individual contributor (no matter how talented) is never going to be as impactful as a squad/team; 2) the structure you build is going to dictate the success or failure of the execution of your ideas; and 3) you have leadership limits of what you can control.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, you do a lot of work and coaching with students and future cyber leaders. What advice do you specifically have for them?\nA. You are the next generation; you are the ones who are gonna pick up the mantle. Don’t fear AI. Humankind over and over again has had tools that disrupt, but with critical thinking and lifelong learning, you’ll master anything that comes, and you’ll still be in charge of it. Our society is growing increasingly dependent on you.\n\n\n\nCybersecurity is not just this thing where we can debate what’s happening in Ukraine; it’s happening here with multiple nations and bad actors all over the world trying to ruin our lives daily. They don’t care that you don’t work for the military or at the NSA; you and American citizens are fair game. You are the front lines where they’re attacking our schools, our cities, our homes, our hospitals. So, whether you do it on behalf of the government or not, you are the future of our national security. \nLearn More at SecurityWeek’s ICS Cybersecurity ConferenceThe leading global conference series for Operations, Control Systems and OT/IT Security professionals to connect on SCADA, DCS PLC and field controller cybersecurity.October 27-30, 2025 | Atlantawww.icscybersecurityconference.com\n\n\nA. I started an offensive cybersecurity consultancy called GRIMM in 2013 after leaving the government. In 2016, Target came to us with a request to build a custom implant. I love the story of Target: their breach in 2013 created the modern cybersecurity ecosystem of organizational investment and market innovation we all enjoy now. Instead of it being a consulting project where we build a tool that trains their defense and we have to build another later, I proposed a platform that would allow you to scale any threat behavior that could ever exist on your terms—and SCYTHE was born. \n\n\n\nBryson Bort\nI realized I couldn’t do it alone and Ron Gula and Dmitri Alperovitch helped me raise and launch the company. The concept is simple: once a threat has breached you, they can only: 1) communicate with the protocols already in your environment to blend, 2) execute on computers you already have, 3) capabilities; only do so many things to accomplish their goals on those hosts. SCYTHE is an offensive box of Legos of communications and capabilities that allow you to no-code create anything a threat might do in your organization. This is key.\n\n\n\nCybersecurity is “hard” because it has to be yours. No one else can give the expert prescription at a distance for the right preventative and detective controls for you. Security is defined by the threat; it’s the only measurement that matters. Our platform allows companies to easily drive that understanding safely and easily across all teams with recommendations.\n\n\n\nQ. SCYTHE is not your first endeavor as an entrepreneur.

Your approach is perceived as building a community that embraces security far beyond the industry. What makes this important?\nA.

The Law of N which is derivative of Dunbar’s Number, the limit of the number of people with which you can maintain good social relationships. The military is built on the organizational concept of squads, 4-10 soldiers, which allows the agility to respond to a rapidly changing environment with a cohesive team with the capability to drive those changes. Then, the unit scales up into platoons, companies, battalions, etc. As an officer, you learn how to manage at different echelons for a greater impact.\n\n\n\nAs an entrepreneur, it’s the same and the Law of N is the variable number of people that you can lead where you personally have a visible impact on their daily requirements. The second you hit N+1, it is another leader below you in the chain who now has that impact. In summary: 1) you can’t do it alone, being an individual contributor (no matter how talented) is never going to be as impactful as a squad/team; 2) the structure you build is going to dictate the success or failure of the execution of your ideas; and 3) you have leadership limits of what you can control.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, you do a lot of work and coaching with students and future cyber leaders. What advice do you specifically have for them?\nA. You are the next generation; you are the ones who are gonna pick up the mantle. Don’t fear AI. Humankind over and over again has had tools that disrupt, but with critical thinking and lifelong learning, you’ll master anything that comes, and you’ll still be in charge of it. Our society is growing increasingly dependent on you.\n\n\n\nCybersecurity is not just this thing where we can debate what’s happening in Ukraine; it’s happening here with multiple nations and bad actors all over the world trying to ruin our lives daily. They don’t care that you don’t work for the military or at the NSA; you and American citizens are fair game. You are the front lines where they’re attacking our schools, our cities, our homes, our hospitals. So, whether you do it on behalf of the government or not, you are the future of our national security. \nLearn More at SecurityWeek’s ICS Cybersecurity ConferenceThe leading global conference series for Operations, Control Systems and OT/IT Security professionals to connect on SCADA, DCS PLC and field controller cybersecurity.October 27-30, 2025 | Atlantawww.icscybersecurityconference.com\n\n\nA. When I founded GRIMM, I learned that it’s not the idea you start with, but the agility to pivot. Which we first did by moving from specialized government work to commercial. When Target approached me in 2016 to help them build custom red team tooling, I realized it was a possible product and asked to keep the intellectual property while co-developing what became the SCYTHE platform with them for two years. Along the way, I realized I knew absolutely nothing about commercial software sales and development  which is why I reached out and expanded my network to learn. This led to Gula and Alperovitch helping me spin out SCYTHE from GRIMM. Then, I learned the hard lesson of Total Addressable Market (TAM). We were building a red team tool, there is no red team market; it’s a $3B market of in-house or outsourced experts with little budget beyond. So, we looked at how we could make it valuable outside of that scope and it’s why we were one of the leading initial proponents of purple teaming.\n\n\n\nThere are three key qualities to an entrepreneur (and being the smartest is not one of them!): risk tolerance, risk and reward of living or dying based on what you can do, and tolerance for pain. You are the chief executive officer (CEO) and the janitor for everything it takes to run this new endeavor.\n\n\n\nQ. How did you first get interested in cybersecurity? Why is it such a passion for you?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nA. Ever since I was little, I had a penchant for technology. I was able to take things apart, put them back together (most of the time), and personally explore the increasing involvement of computers in our lives. I wanted to understand the ins and outs of MS-DOS; I programmed complex games on my graphing calculator for fun when we had to use them in high school; and I wanted to break the protections on games so I could modify them to make them more interesting. “Cybersecurity” when I worked in information security as a cadet at West Point pretty much consisted of running around with golden disks whenever a virus struck, or patches needed to be rolled out and it wasn’t much more complex when I was an Army Officer.\n\n\n\nMy passion for cybersecurity comes from a lifelong passion for service and protection. Cybersecurity isn’t an esoteric nerd thing: it is the regular people trying to live their lives and be able to manage money; it is local schools, hospitals, and towns trying to provide a good quality of life for their citizens.\n\n\n\nQ. Tell me why the intense focus on industrial control systems (ICS) and why you co-founded ICS Village. It seems the focus on this has accelerated significantly in the last five years. Why?\nA. Most people only know industrial control systems as “Stuxnet” and, even then, with a limited idea of what exactly that means. These are the computers that run critical infrastructure, manufacturing plants, and dialysis machines in hospitals. A bad day with normal computers means ransomware where a business can’t run, espionage where a company loses valuable data, or a regular person getting scammed out of their bank account. All pretty bad, but at least everyone is still breathing. With ICS, a bad day can mean loss of life or limb and that’s just at the point of use. The downstream effects of water or electricity being disrupted sends us to the Stone Ages immediately and there is a direct correlation to loss of life in those scenarios.\n\n\n\nSimulated water plant constructed in ICS Village demonstrates hands-on learning experiences for different components of industrial control system security.\nI co-founded the ICS Village, a non-profit 501c3 with a mission to educate and build awareness for critical infrastructure security, with Tom VanNorman in 2017 because we both believe something needs to change. And for years, no one really cared. Then, Oldsmar happened (ironically, nothing actually happened, but it still got the right attention) and we had been demonstrating that attack for years on our custom-built water plant (pictured above).

The Law of N which is derivative of Dunbar’s Number, the limit of the number of people with which you can maintain good social relationships. The military is built on the organizational concept of squads, 4-10 soldiers, which allows the agility to respond to a rapidly changing environment with a cohesive team with the capability to drive those changes. Then, the unit scales up into platoons, companies, battalions, etc. As an officer, you learn how to manage at different echelons for a greater impact.\n\n\n\nAs an entrepreneur, it’s the same and the Law of N is the variable number of people that you can lead where you personally have a visible impact on their daily requirements. The second you hit N+1, it is another leader below you in the chain who now has that impact. In summary: 1) you can’t do it alone, being an individual contributor (no matter how talented) is never going to be as impactful as a squad/team; 2) the structure you build is going to dictate the success or failure of the execution of your ideas; and 3) you have leadership limits of what you can control.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, you do a lot of work and coaching with students and future cyber leaders. What advice do you specifically have for them?\nA. You are the next generation; you are the ones who are gonna pick up the mantle. Don’t fear AI.

The military is built on the organizational concept of squads, 4-10 soldiers, which allows the agility to respond to a rapidly changing environment with a cohesive team with the capability to drive those changes. Then, the unit scales up into platoons, companies, battalions, etc. As an officer, you learn how to manage at different echelons for a greater impact.\n\n\n\nAs an entrepreneur, it’s the same and the Law of N is the variable number of people that you can lead where you personally have a visible impact on their daily requirements. The second you hit N+1, it is another leader below you in the chain who now has that impact. In summary: 1) you can’t do it alone, being an individual contributor (no matter how talented) is never going to be as impactful as a squad/team; 2) the structure you build is going to dictate the success or failure of the execution of your ideas; and 3) you have leadership limits of what you can control.\n\n\n\nQ.  Finally, you do a lot of work and coaching with students and future cyber leaders. What advice do you specifically have for them?\nA. You are the next generation; you are the ones who are gonna pick up the mantle. Don’t fear AI.

You are the front lines where they’re attacking our schools, our cities, our homes, our hospitals. So, whether you do it on behalf of the government or not, you are the future of our national security. \nLearn More at SecurityWeek’s ICS Cybersecurity ConferenceThe leading global conference series for Operations, Control Systems and OT/IT Security professionals to connect on SCADA, DCS PLC and field controller cybersecurity.October 27-30, 2025 | Atlantawww.icscybersecurityconference.com\n\n\nA. Most people only know industrial control systems as “Stuxnet” and, even then, with a limited idea of what exactly that means. These are the computers that run critical infrastructure, manufacturing plants, and dialysis machines in hospitals. A bad day with normal computers means ransomware where a business can’t run, espionage where a company loses valuable data, or a regular person getting scammed out of their bank account. All pretty bad, but at least everyone is still breathing. With ICS, a bad day can mean loss of life or limb and that’s just at the point of use. The downstream effects of water or electricity being disrupted sends us to the Stone Ages immediately and there is a direct correlation to loss of life in those scenarios.\n\n\n\nSimulated water plant constructed in ICS Village demonstrates hands-on learning experiences for different components of industrial control system security.\nI co-founded the ICS Village, a non-profit 501c3 with a mission to educate and build awareness for critical infrastructure security, with Tom VanNorman in 2017 because we both believe something needs to change. And for years, no one really cared. Then, Oldsmar happened (ironically, nothing actually happened, but it still got the right attention) and we had been demonstrating that attack for years on our custom-built water plant (pictured above). Then, Colonial Pipeline was the real game changer. As I wrote in a USA Today op-ed with Dr. Paul Rosenzweig, you definitely get the attention in a hydrocarbon-based (gas) economy where disruption affects daily life.\n\n\n\nQ.  Many career cyber folks can get myopic by only applying security solutions to the problems security practitioners face. Your approach is perceived as building a community that embraces security far beyond the industry. What makes this important?\nA.
