        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a case of an incomplete patch for a previously addressed security flaw impacting the NVIDIA Container Toolkit that, if successfully exploited, could put sensitive data at risk.\nThe original vulnerability\nCVE-2024-0132\n(CVSS score: 9.0) is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability that could lead to a container escape attack and allow for unauthorized access to the underlying host.\nWhile this flaw was resolved by NVIDIA in September 2024, a new analysis by Trend Micro has revealed the fix to be incomplete and that there also exists a related performance flaw affecting Docker on Linux that could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\"These issues could enable attackers to escape container isolation, access sensitive host resources, and cause severe operational disruptions,\" Trend Micro researcher Abdelrahman Esmail\nsaid\nin a new report published today.\nThe fact that the TOCTOU vulnerability persists means that a specially crafted container could be abused to access the host file system and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. The flaw impacts version 1.17.4 if the feature allow-cuda-compat-libs-from-container is explicitly enabled.\n\"The specific flaw exists within the mount_files function,\" Trend Micro\nsaid\n. \"The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the host.\"\nHowever, for this privilege escalation to work, the attacker must have already obtained the ability to execute code within a container.\nThe shortcoming has been assigned the CVE identifier\nCVE-2025-23359\n(CVSS score: 9.0), which was previously flagged by cloud security firm Wiz as also a bypass for CVE-2024-0132 back in February 2025. It has been\naddressed\nin version 1.17.4.\nThe cybersecurity company said it also discovered a performance issue during the analysis of the CVE-2024-0132 that could potentially lead to a DoS vulnerability on the host machine. It affects Docker instances on Linux systems.\n\"When a new container is created with multiple mounts configured using (bind-propagation=shared), multiple parent/child paths are established. However, the associated entries are not removed in the Linux mount table after container termination,\" Esmail said.\n\"This leads to a rapid and uncontrollable growth of the mount table, exhausting available file descriptors (fd). Eventually, Docker is unable to create new containers due to fd exhaustion. This excessively large mount table leads to a huge performance issue, preventing users from connecting to the host (i.e., via SSH).\"\nTo mitigate the issue, it's advised to monitor the Linux mount table for abnormal growth, limit Docker API access to authorized personnel, enforce strong access control policies, and conduct periodic audits of container-to-host filesystem bindings, volume mounts, and socket connections.\nFound this article interesting?

But, in reality, it harbors features to inject malicious code into cryptocurrency wallet software associated with Atomic Wallet and Exodus.\n\"Effectively, a victim who tried to send crypto funds to another crypto wallet would have the intended wallet destination address swapped out for one belonging to the malicious actor,\" ReversingLabs researcher Lucija Valentić\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe npm package in question was\nfirst published\non March 24, 2025, and has received three updates since then but not before the previous versions were likely removed by the authors themselves. The latest version, 1.1.2, was uploaded on April 8 and remains available for download. The package has been downloaded\n334 times\nto date.\nThe disclosure comes merely weeks after the software supply chain security firm uncovered two npm packages named\nethers-provider2 and ethers-providerz\nthat were engineered to infect locally installed packages and establish a reverse shell to connect to the threat actor's server over SSH.\nWhat makes this approach an attractive option for threat actors is that it allows the malware to persist on developer systems even after the malicious package is removed.\nAn analysis of pdf-to-office has revealed that the malicious code embedded within the package checks for the presence of the \"atomic/resources/app.asar\" archive inside the \"AppData/Local/Programs\" folder to ascertain that Atomic Wallet is installed on the Windows computer, and if so, introduce the\nclipper functionality\n.\n\"If the archive was present, the malicious code would overwrite one of its files with a new trojanized version that had the same functionality as the legitimate file, but switched the outgoing crypto address where funds would be sent with the address of a Base64-encoded Web3 wallet belonging to the threat actor,\" Valentić said.\nIn a similar vein, the payload is also designed to trojanize the file \"src/app/ui/index.js\" associated with the Exodus wallet.\nBut in an interesting twist, the attacks are aimed at two specific versions each of both Atomic Wallet (2.91.5 and 2.90.6) and Exodus (25.13.3 and 25.9.2) so as to ensure that the correct JavaScript files are overwritten.\n\"If, by chance, the package pdf-to-office was removed from the computer, the Web3 wallets' software would remain compromised and continue to channel crypto funds to the attackers' wallet,\" Valentić said. \"The only way to completely remove the malicious trojanized files from the Web3 wallets' software would be to remove them completely from the computer, and re-install them.\"\nThe disclosure comes as ExtensionTotal detailed 10 malicious Visual Studio Code extensions that stealthily download a PowerShell script that disables Windows security, establishes persistence through scheduled tasks, and installs an XMRig cryptominer.\nThe extensions were collectively installed over a million times before they were taken down. The names of the extensions are below -\nPrettier — Code for VSCode (by prettier)\nDiscord Rich Presence for VS Code (by Mark H)\nRojo — Roblox Studio Sync (by evaera)\nSolidity Compiler (by VSCode Developer)\nClaude AI (by Mark H)\nGolang Compiler (by Mark H)\nChatGPT Agent for VSCode (by Mark H)\nHTML Obfuscator (by Mark H)\nPython Obfuscator for VSCode (by Mark H)\nRust Compiler for VSCode (by Mark H)\n\"The attackers created a sophisticated multi-stage attack, even installing the legitimate extensions they impersonated to avoid raising suspicion while mining cryptocurrency in the background,\" ExtensionTotal\nsaid\n.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Overview of the PlayPraetor Masquerading Party Variants\nCTM360\nhas now identified a much larger extent of the ongoing Play Praetor campaign. What started with 6000+ URLs of a very specific banking attack has now grown to 16,000+ with multiple variants. This research is ongoing, and much more is expected to be discovered in the coming days.\nAs before, all the newly discovered play impersonations are mimicking legitimate app listings, deceiving users into installing malicious Android applications or exposing sensitive personal information. While these incidents initially appeared to be isolated, further investigation has revealed a globally coordinated campaign that poses a significant threat to the integrity of the Play Store ecosystem.\nEvolution of the Threat\nThis report\nexpands on the earlier research into PlayPraetor, highlighting the discovery of five newly identified variants. These variants reveal the campaign's increasing sophistication in terms of attack techniques, distribution channels, and social engineering tactics. The continuous evolution of PlayPraetor demonstrates its adaptability and persistent targeting of the Android ecosystem.\nVariant-Specific Targeting and Regional Focus\nIn addition to the original PlayPraetor Banking Trojan, five new variants—\nPhish\n,\nRAT\n,\nPWA\n,\nPhantom\n, and\nVeil\n—have been identified. These variants are distributed through fake websites that closely resemble the Google Play Store. Although they share common malicious behaviors, each variant exhibits unique characteristics tailored to specific regions and use cases. Targeted regions include the Philippines, India, South Africa, and various global markets.\nThese variants employ a mix of credential phishing, remote access capabilities, deceptive web app installations, abuse of Android accessibility services, and stealth techniques that hide malicious activity behind legitimate branding.\nAttack Objectives and Industry Focus\nWhile each variant has unique features and regional targeting, a common theme across all PlayPraetor samples is their focus on the\nfinancial sector\n. Threat actors behind these variants seek to steal banking credentials, credit/debit card details, digital wallet access, and, in some cases, execute fraudulent transactions by transferring funds to mule accounts. These monetization strategies indicate a well-organized operation focused on financial gain.\nVariant Summary and Detection Insights\nThe five new variants—\nPhish\n,\nRAT\n,\nPWA\n,\nPhantom\n, and\nVeil\n—are currently under active investigation. Some variants have confirmed detection statistics, while others are still being analyzed. A comparative table summarizing these variants, their capabilities, and regional targets is included in the following section, along with detailed technical analysis.\nVariant Name\nFunctionality\nDescription\nTarget Industry\nDetected Cases (Approx.)\nPlayPraetor PWA\nDeceptive Progressive Web App\nInstalls a fake PWA that mimics legitimate apps, creates shortcuts on the home screen, and triggers persistent push notifications to lure interaction.\nTechnology Industry, Financial Industry, Gaming Industry, Gambling Industry, e-commerce Industry\n5400+\nPlayPraetor Phish\nWebView phishing\nA WebView-based app that launches a phishing webpage to steal user credentials.\nFinancial, Telecommunication, Fast Food Industry\n1400+\nPlayPraetor Phantom\nStealthy Persistence & Command Execution\nExploits Android accessibility services for persistent control. Runs silently, exfiltrates data, hides its icon, blocks uninstallation, and poses as a system update.\nFinancial Industry, Gambling Industry, Technology Industry\nThese variants are currently under investigation to determine their exact identities.\nPlayPraetor RAT\nRemote Access Trojan\nGrants attackers full remote control of the infected device, enabling surveillance, data theft, and manipulation.\nFinancial Industry\nPlayPraetor Veil\nRegional & Invitation-based Phishing\nDisguises itself using legitimate branding, restricts access via invite codes, and imposes regional limitations to avoid detection and increase trust among local users.\nFinancial Industry, Energy Industry\nGeographic Distribution and Targeting Patterns\nCTM360's analysis indicates that while PlayPraetor variants are being distributed globally, certain strains exhibit broader outreach strategies than others. Notably, the\nPhantom-WW\nvariant stands out for its global targeting approach. In this case, threat actors impersonate a widely recognized application with global appeal, allowing them to cast a wider net and increase the likelihood of victim engagement across multiple regions.\nAmong the identified variants, the\nPWA\nvariant emerged as the most prevalent, with detection across a wide array of geographic regions. Its reach spans\nSouth America, Europe, Oceania, Central Asia, South Asia\n, and parts of the\nAfrican continent\n, underscoring its role as the most widespread variant within the PlayPraetor campaign.\nOther variants showed more specific regional targeting. The\nPhish\nvariant was also distributed across multiple regions, though with slightly less saturation than PWA. In contrast, the\nRAT\nvariant exhibited a notable concentration of activity in\nSouth Africa\n, suggesting a region-specific focus. Similarly, the\nVeil\nvariant was observed primarily in the\nUnited States\nand select\nAfrican nations\n, reflecting a more targeted deployment strategy.\nHow to Stay Safe\nTo mitigate the risk of falling victim to PlayPraetor and similar scams:\n✅ Only download apps from the official Google Play Store or Apple App Store\n✅ Verify app developers and read reviews before installing any application\n✅ Avoid granting unnecessary permissions, especially Accessibility Services\n✅ Use mobile security solutions to detect and block malware-infected APKs\n✅ Stay updated on emerging threats by following cybersecurity reports\nRead the full report\nto explore variant behaviors, detection insights, and actionable recommendations.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "AI agents have rapidly evolved from experimental technology to essential business tools. The\nOWASP\nframework explicitly recognizes that Non-Human Identities play a key role in agentic AI security.\nTheir analysis\nhighlights how these autonomous software entities can make decisions, chain complex actions together, and operate continuously without human intervention. They're no longer just tools, but an integral and significant part of your organization's workforce.\nConsider this reality: Today's AI agents can analyze customer data, generate reports, manage system resources, and even deploy code, all without a human clicking a single button. This shift represents both tremendous opportunity and unprecedented risk.\nAI Agents are only as secure as their NHIs\nHere's what security leaders are not necessarily considering:\nAI agents don't operate in isolation\n. To function, they need access to data, systems, and resources. This highly privileged, often overlooked access happens through non-human identities: API keys,\nservice accounts\n,\nOAuth tokens\n, and other\nmachine credentials\n.\nThese NHIs are the connective tissue between AI agents and your organization's digital assets. They determine what your AI workforce can and cannot do.\nThe critical insight: While AI security encompasses many facets,\nsecuring AI agents fundamentally means securing the NHIs they use.\nIf an AI agent can't access sensitive data, it can't expose it. If its permissions are properly monitored, it can't perform unauthorized actions.\nAI Agents are a force multiplier for NHI risks\nAI agents magnify existing NHI security challenges in ways that traditional security measures weren't designed to address:\nThey operate at machine speed and scale\n, executing thousands of actions in seconds\nThey chain multiple tools and permissions\nin ways that security teams can't predict\nThey run continuously\nwithout natural session boundaries\nThey require broad system access\nto deliver maximum value\nThey create new attack vectors\nin multi-agent architectures\nAI agents require broad and sensitive permissions to interact across multiple systems and environments, increasing the scale and complexity of NHI security and management.\nThis creates severe security vulnerabilities:\nShadow AI proliferation:\nEmployees deploy unregistered AI agents using existing API keys without proper oversight, creating hidden backdoors that persist even after employee offboarding.\nIdentity spoofing & privilege abuse:\nAttackers can hijack an AI agent's extensive permissions, gaining broad access across multiple systems simultaneously.\nAI tool misuse & identity compromise:\nCompromised agents can trigger unauthorized workflows, modify data, or orchestrate sophisticated data exfiltration campaigns while appearing as legitimate system activity.\nCross-system authorization exploitation:\nAI agents with multi-system access dramatically increase potential breach impacts, turning a single compromise into a potentially catastrophic security event.\nSecuring Agentic AI with Astrix\nAstrix transforms your AI security posture by providing\ncomplete control over the non-human identities\nthat power your AI agents. Instead of struggling with invisible risks and potential breaches, you gain immediate visibility into your entire AI ecosystem, understand precisely where vulnerabilities exist, and can act decisively to\nmitigate threats before they materialize\n.\nBy connecting every AI agent to human ownership and\ncontinuously monitoring for anomalous behavior\n, Astrix eliminates security blind spots while enabling your organization to scale AI adoption confidently.\nThe result: dramatically reduced risk exposure,\nstrengthened compliance posture\n, and the freedom to embrace AI innovation without compromising security.\nStay Ahead of the Curve\nAs organizations race to adopt AI agents, those who implement proper NHI security controls will realize the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls. The reality is clear: in the era of AI, your organization's security posture depends on how well you manage the digital identities that connect your AI workforce to your most valuable assets.\nWant to learn more about Astrix and NHI security?

What makes the \"sprawling\" Python-based tool stand apart is its ability to craft content such that it can bypass spam filters.\nIt's believed that the bulk messaging tool has been put to use since at least September 2024, starting off under the name \"Shopbot\" in what appears to be a reference to websites using Shopify.\nOver time, AkiraBot has expanded its targeting footprint to include sites developed using GoDaddy, Wix, and Squarespace, as well as those that have generic contact forms and live chat widgets built using Reamaze.\nThe crux of the operation – which is to generate the spam content – is facilitated by leveraging the OpenAI API. The tool also offers a graphical user interface (GUI) to choose the list of websites to be targeted and customize how many of them can be targeted in a concurrent fashion.\n\"AkiraBot creates custom spam messages for targeted websites by processing a template that contains a generic outline of the type of message the bot should send,\" the researchers said. \"The template is processed by a prompt sent to the OpenAI chat API to generate a customized outreach message based on the contents of the website.\"\nAn analysis of the source code reveals that the OpenAI client uses the gpt-4o-mini model and is assigned the role of a \"helpful assistant that generates marketing messages.\"\nAnother notable aspect of the service is that it can get around CAPTCHA barriers to spam websites at scale and evades network-based detections by relying on a proxy service that's typically offered to advertisers. The targeted CAPTCHA services consist of hCAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA, and Cloudflare Turnstile.\nTo accomplish this, the bot's web traffic is designed to mimic a legitimate end user and makes use of different proxy hosts from SmartProxy to obscure the source of the traffic.\nAkiraBot is also configured to log its activities in a file named \"submissions.csv\" that records both successful and failed spam attempts. An examination of these files has revealed that more than 420,000 unique domains have been targeted to date. Furthermore, success metrics related to CAPTCHA bypass and proxy rotation are collected and posted to a Telegram channel via API.\nIn response to the findings, OpenAI has disabled the API key and other associated assets used by the threat actors.\n\"The author or authors have invested significant effort in this bot's ability to bypass commonly used CAPTCHA technologies, which demonstrates that the operators are motivated to violate service provider protections,\" the researchers said. \"AkiraBot's use of LLM-generated spam message content demonstrates the emerging challenges that AI poses to defending websites against spam attacks.\"\nThe development coincides with the emergence of a cybercrime tool referred to as Xanthorox AI that's marketed as an all-in-one chatbot to handle code generation, malware development, vulnerability exploitation, and data analysis. The platform also supports voice-based interaction via real-time voice calls and asynchronous voice messaging.\n\"Xanthorox AI is powered by five distinct models, each optimized for different operational tasks,\" SlashNext\nsaid\n. \"These models run entirely on local servers controlled by the seller, rather than being deployed over public cloud infrastructure or through exposed APIs. This local-first approach drastically reduces the chances of detection, shutdown, or traceability.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Hackers started exploiting a high-severity flaw that allows bypassing authentication in the OttoKit (formerly SureTriggers) plugin for WordPress just hours after public disclosure.\nUsers are strongly recommended to upgrade to the latest version of OttoKit/SureTriggers, currently 1.0.79, released at the beginning of the month.\nThe\nOttoKit WordPress plugin\nallows users to connect plugins and external tools like WooCommerce, Mailchimp, and Google Sheets, automate tasks like sending emails and adding users, or updating CRMs without code. Statistics\nshow\nthat the product is active on 100,000 websites.\nYesterday,\nWordfence disclosed\nan authentication bypass vulnerability in OttoKit, identified as CVE-2025-3102. The flaw impacts all versions of SureTriggers/OttoKit up to 1.0.78.\nThe flaw stems from a missing empty value check in the\nauthenticate_user()\nfunction, which handles REST API authentication. Exploitation to be possible if the plugin is not configured with an API key, which causes the stored\nsecret_key\nto remain empty.\nThe vulnerable code\nSource: Wordfence\nAn attacker could exploit this by sending an empty\nst_authorization\nheader to pass the check and grant unauthorized access to protected API endpoints.\nEssentially, CVE-2025-3102 allows attackers to create new administrator accounts without authentication, posing a high risk of full site takeover.\nWordfence received a report about the flaw from security researcher 'mikemyers', who earned a bounty of $1,024 for the discovery in mid-March.\nThe plugin vendor was contacted on April 3 with the full exploitation details, and they released a fix via version 1.0.79 on the same day.\nHowever, hackers quickly jumped at the opportunity to exploit the issue, taking advantage of administrators' delay in updating the plugin to address the security problem.\nResearchers at WordPress security platform Patchstack are warning that the first exploitation attempts in the wild were logged only a few hours after the disclosure of the flaw.\n“Attackers were quick to exploit this vulnerability, with the first recorded attempt occurring just four hours after it was added as a vPatch to our database,”\nreports Patchstack\n.\n“This swift exploitation highlights the critical need to apply patches or mitigations immediately upon the public disclosure of such vulnerabilities,” the researchers say.\nThe threat actors attempt to create new administrator accounts using randomized username/password and email address combination, a sign of task automation.\nIf you’re using OttoKit/SureTriggers, upgrade to version 1.0.79 as soon as possible and check logs for unexpected admin accounts or other user roles, installation of plugins/themes, database access events, and modification of security settings.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nNew Mirai botnet behind surge in TVT DVR exploitation\nNewest Ivanti SSRF zero-day now under mass exploitation\nCritical auth bypass bug in CrushFTP now exploited in attacks\nThe 4 WordPress flaws hackers targeted the most in Q1 2025\nPalo Alto Networks tags new firewall bug as exploited in attacks"

        "Content": "The Russian state-backed hacking group Gamaredon (aka “Shuckworm”) has been targeting a military mission of a Western country in Ukraine in attacks likely deployed from removable drives.\nSymantec threat researchers say the campaign started in February 2025 and continued until March, with hackers deploying an updated version of the GammaSteel info-stealing malware to exfiltrate data.\nAccording to the\nreport\n, initial access to the infected systems was probably achieved via removable drives containing malicious .LNK files, a vector that\nGamaredon has used in the past\n.\nThe researchers note a change in the threat actor's tactics, including a shift from VBS scripts to PowerShell-based tools, more obfuscation for payloads, and increased use of legitimate services for evasion.\nLatest Gamaredon attacks in Ukraine\nDuring the investigation, the researchers noticed in the Windows Registry of the compromised system a new value under the UserAssist key, indicating that the infection started from an external drive from a shortcut file named\nfiles.lnk.\nNext, a heavily obfuscated script creates and runs two files. The first handles command and control (C2) communications, resolving the server address using legitimate services, and connecting to Cloudflare-protected URLs.\nThe second file handles the spreading mechanism to infect other removable and network drives using LNK files, while also hiding certain folders and system files to hide the compromise.\nModifying Registry keys to hide specific files\nSource: Symantec\nNext, Gamaredon used a reconnaissance PowerShell script that can capture and exfiltrate screenshots of the infected device and gather information about installed antivirus tools, files, and running processes.\nThe final payload used in the observed attacks is a PowerShell-based version of GammaSteel that is stored in Windows Registry.\nPayload stored in Registry, obfuscated and split by functions\nSource: Symantec\nThe malware can steal documents (.DOC, .PDF, .XLS, .TXT) from various locations like Desktop, Documents, and Downloads, confirming Gamaredon’s continuing interest in espionage.\nUltimately, the malware uses ‘certutil.exe’ to hash the files and exfiltrates them using PowerShell web requests. If the exfiltration fails, Gamaredon uses cURL over Tor to transfer the stolen data.\nFinally, a new key is added to ‘HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run’ to establish persistence on the target computer.\nThe recent Gamaredon campaign reflects an effort to increase operational stealth and effectiveness despite the threat group’s limited sophistication compared to other Russian state actors.\nSymantec comments that various incremental but meaningful improvements in the threat group’s TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) elevate the risks it poses to Western networks, especially considering Gamaredon’s unwavering tenacity.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nRussian military hackers deploy malicious Windows activators in Ukraine\nMicrosoft fixes printing issues caused by January Windows updates\nCyberattack takes down Ukrainian state railway’s online services\nUkrainian military targeted in new Signal spear-phishing attacks\nMicrosoft: Recent Windows updates make USB printers print random text"

Notifications across all connected devices are silenced automatically to avoid disrupting the user while focused.\nThe smart home integration features are compatible with Apple and Google Home, so the device can control lighting, music, blinds, and other connected devices and adjust them to increase productivity.\nThe back side of BUSY Bar\nSource: Flipper Devices\n\"We aim to create a fun, customizable, and practical tool that helps you maintain deep focus,\" stated Pavel Zhovner, co-founder and CEO of Flipper Devices.\n\"Context switching consumes a lot of energy—when you're interrupted while writing an important email or deeply focused on a task, whether in an open-floor office or working remotely at home, it becomes much harder to refocus and continue where you left off.\"\n\"This is where BUSY Bar comes in. It helps you reduce distractions and manage interruptions from others, allowing you to stay in the zone.\"\nBUSY Bar is the second standalone hardware device launched by Flipper Devices, following their initial product, Flipper Zero, which has sold over half a million units and generated over $100 million in revenue since 2020.\nPre-sales for BUSY Bar have already opened through the\nofficial website\n, with the price set to $249.\nA Kickstarter campaign, which will include special offers and perks, is also set to launch in the upcoming period.\nFlipper Devices told BleepingComputer BUSY Bar development is in its final stages, and the first units will be ready to ship before the end of the year.\n\"We’re aiming to launch the device on Kickstarter this summer.

What a silly question, right? It may have been just moments ago and perhaps it’s even how you landed on this blogpost. \nOthers searching online, however, may encounter less favorable outcomes. How so? Our habit of blindly trusting and clicking on top search results has become so predictable that it can be subverted and turned against us. \nCautionary examples aren’t hard to come by, and I recall one that is too quirky not to mention: some Australians who recently searched for something as innocuous as the legality of Bengal cats in the country didn’t receive straightforward information on pet regulations; instead, they unwittingly ran the risk of having their data stolen following a chain of events that started with a click on a top search engine result.\nBut even if you’re not a cat fancier, you should know that even a simple search query may breed trouble. Some cybercriminals have for years been using techniques that can push malicious websites dressed up to look legit into the top of people’s search results, typically leveraging either SEO poisoning (also known as black hat SEO) or, even more commonly, malicious search ads.\nOne sophisticated example of 'SEO fraud as a service' was exposed by ESET researchers in 2021 after they found a previously undocumented server-side trojan that manipulated search engine results by hijacking the reputation of the websites it compromises. Similar campaigns were spotted again just weeks ago.\nIn another example, ESET researchers identified a campaign that deployed ads in Google search results leading victims to phony websites that looked identical to those of popular software, such as Firefox, WhatsApp, or Telegram. The end goal was to gain complete control of the compromised devices.\nThe risks aren’t lost on Google, of course. According to its latest Ads Safety Report, in 2023 the company \"blocked or removed over 5.5 billion ads, slightly up from the prior year, and suspended 12.7 million advertiser accounts, nearly double from the previous year.\"\nSome threats still slip through, however. Which is why it pays to know about the risks involved in both organic and paid search results, and how to separate the wheat from the chaff. \nThe recent meteoric rise of AI tools, for one, has created new hunting grounds for scammers, sparking schemes where fraudsters bought ads for counterfeit ChatGPT sites that redirected people to websites harvesting credit card details. The site below displayed logos of actual OpenAI partners, possibly duping even many tech-savvy victims. Much the same thing happened with other AI tools, including most recently when DeepSeek burst onto the scene.\nESET researchers in Latin America recently spotted a sophisticated campaign that impersonated the La Veloz del Norte bus company campaigns and targeted Argentinians who search for long-distance bus tickets. Travelers who entered their information on the imposter site unwittingly handed over both login credentials and banking details to cybercriminals.\nFinancial services represent particularly high-value targets. In 2022, ESET researchers in Latin America alerted people to scams impersonating Mastercard through ads.\nMost of all, remember that prominence in search results doesn’t automatically equate to legitimacy. Also, chances are high that many people don’t always distinguish between organic results and ads, and criminals take advantage of this especially through malvertising campaigns aimed at people who, for example, search for software.\nIn some cases, fraudsters may register a typosquatting or similar-looking top-level domain to that of the software publisher in order to dupe the victim, as was the case here with telegraem[.]org. Which is why you should avoid blindly clicking on whatever appears at the top of your search page. Instead, examine the URLs meticulously and look out for any signs that something is amiss. Apply the same level of scrutiny if you’re using Google’s AI search features, as scammers are constantly evolving their methods and find new ways of promoting websites that push scams and malware.\nProtect your digital accounts with strong and unique passwords or passphrases, as well as with two-factor authentication. Use reputable security software that can identify and block connections to malicious domains, thus providing an additional layer of protection against deceptive search results.\nAlso, Google itself offers tools to inspect the results, such as accessing details by clicking the three dots adjacent to sponsored listings, which can expose discrepancies between claims and the true identity. If you suspect that you've encountered a dodgy website, you can report it to Google.\nWe’ve all done it a million times: typed a query, scanned results, clicked on one of them, ‘got our fill’, and moved on. And although classic search engines increasingly compete with the likes of ChatGPT and AI-generated search summaries, the classic search-and-click routine is unlikely to go anywhere any time soon. Old habits die hard, and the risks aren’t going anywhere, either. Search carefully.\n\n      Sign up for our newsletters\n    \nDigital Security\nSo your friend has been hacked: Could you be next?\nDigital Security\nSo your friend has been hacked: Could you be next?\n\nDigital Security\n1 billion reasons to protect your identity online\nDigital Security\n1 billion reasons to protect your identity online\n\nDigital Security\nHow scammers are exploiting DeepSeek's rise\nDigital Security\nHow scammers are exploiting DeepSeek's rise\n\nDigital Security\nYou may not care where you download software from, but malware does\nDigital Security\nHow scammers are exploiting DeepSeek's rise\nMalware\nIn plain sight: Malicious ads hiding in search results\n\n            Award-winning news, views, and insight from the ESET security community\n          "

        "Content": "China-based purveyors of SMS phishing kits are enjoying remarkable success converting phished payment card data into mobile wallets from Apple and Google. Until recently, the so-called “Smishing Triad” mainly impersonated toll road operators and shipping companies. But experts say these groups are now directly targeting customers of international financial institutions, while dramatically expanding their cybercrime infrastructure and support staff.\nAn image of an iPhone device farm shared on Telegram by one of the Smishing Triad members. Image: Prodaft.\nIf you own a mobile device, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years you’ve received at least one instant message that warns of a delinquent toll road fee, or a wayward package from the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Those who click the promoted link are brought to a website that spoofs the USPS or a local toll road operator and asks for payment card information.\nThe site will then complain that the visitor’s bank needs to “verify” the transaction by sending a one-time code via SMS. In reality, the bank is sending that code to the mobile number on file for their customer because the fraudsters have just attempted to enroll that victim’s card details into a mobile wallet.\nIf the visitor supplies that one-time code, their payment card is then added to a new mobile wallet on an Apple or Google device that is physically controlled by the phishers. The phishing gangs typically load multiple stolen cards to digital wallets on a single Apple or Android device, and then sell those phones in bulk to scammers who use them for fraudulent e-commerce and tap-to-pay transactions.\nA screenshot of the administrative panel for a smishing kit. On the left is the (test) data entered at the phishing site. On the right we can see the phishing kit has superimposed the supplied card number onto an image of a payment card. When the phishing kit scans that created card image into Apple or Google Pay, it triggers the victim’s bank to send a one-time code. Image: Ford Merrill.\nThe moniker “Smishing Triad” comes from Resecurity, which was among the first to report in August 2023 on the emergence of three distinct mobile phishing groups based in China that appeared to share some infrastructure and innovative phishing techniques. But it is a bit of a misnomer because the phishing lures blasted out by these groups are not SMS or text messages in the conventional sense.\nRather, they are sent via iMessage to Apple device users, and via RCS on Google Android devices. Thus, the missives bypass the mobile phone networks entirely and enjoy near 100 percent delivery rate (at least until Apple and Google suspend the spammy accounts).\nIn a report published on March 24, the Swiss threat intelligence firm Prodaft detailed the rapid pace of innovation coming from the Smishing Triad, which it characterizes as a loosely federated group of Chinese phishing-as-a-service operators with names like Darcula, Lighthouse, and the Xinxin Group.\nProdaft said they’re seeing a significant shift in the underground economy, particularly among Chinese-speaking threat actors who have historically operated in the shadows compared to their Russian-speaking counterparts.\n“Chinese-speaking actors are introducing innovative and cost-effective systems, enabling them to target larger user bases with sophisticated services,” Prodaft wrote. “Their approach marks a new era in underground business practices, emphasizing scalability and efficiency in cybercriminal operations.”\nA new report from researchers at the security firm SilentPush finds the Smishing Triad members have expanded into selling mobile phishing kits targeting customers of global financial institutions like CitiGroup, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, and Visa, as well as banks in Canada, Latin America, Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region.\nPhishing lures from the Smishing Triad spoofing PayPal. Image: SilentPush.\nSilentPush found the Smishing Triad now spoofs recognizable brands in a variety of industry verticals across at least 121 countries and a vast number of industries, including the postal, logistics, telecommunications, transportation, finance, retail and public sectors.\nAccording to SilentPush, the domains used by the Smishing Triad are rotated frequently, with approximately 25,000 phishing domains active during any 8-day period and a majority of them sitting at two Chinese hosting companies: Tencent (AS132203) and Alibaba (AS45102).\n“With nearly two-thirds of all countries in the world targeted by [the] Smishing Triad, it’s safe to say they are essentially targeting every country with modern infrastructure outside of Iran, North Korea, and Russia,” SilentPush wrote. “Our team has observed some potential targeting in Russia (such as domains that mentioned their country codes), but nothing definitive enough to indicate Russia is a persistent target. Interestingly, even though these are Chinese threat actors, we have seen instances of targeting aimed at Macau and Hong Kong, both special administrative regions of China.”\nSilentPush’s Zach Edwards said his team found a vulnerability that exposed data from one of the Smishing Triad’s phishing pages, which revealed the number of visits each site received each day across thousands of phishing domains that were active at the time. Based on that data, SilentPush estimates those phishing pages received well more than a million visits within a 20-day time span.\nThe report notes the Smishing Triad boasts it has “300+ front desk staff worldwide” involved in one of their more popular phishing kits — Lighthouse — staff that is mainly used to support various aspects of the group’s fraud and cash-out schemes.\nThe Smishing Triad members maintain their own Chinese-language sales channels on Telegram, which frequently offer videos and photos of their staff hard at work. Some of those images include massive walls of phones used to send phishing messages, with human operators seated directly in front of them ready to receive any time-sensitive one-time codes.\nAs noted in February’s story How Phished Data Turns Into Apple and Google Wallets, one of those cash-out schemes involves an Android app called Z-NFC, which can relay a valid NFC transaction from one of these compromised digital wallets to anywhere in the world. For a $500 month subscription, the customer can wave their phone at any payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app will relay an NFC transaction over the Internet from a stolen wallet on a phone in China.\nChinese nationals were recently busted trying to use these NFC apps to buy high-end electronics in Singapore. And in the United States, authorities in California and Tennessee arrested Chinese nationals accused of using NFC apps to fraudulently purchase gift cards from retailers.\nThe Prodaft researchers said they were able to find a previously undocumented backend management panel for Lucid, a smishing-as-a-service operation tied to the XinXin Group. The panel included victim figures that suggest the smishing campaigns maintain an average success rate of approximately five percent, with some domains receiving over 500 visits per week.\n“In one observed instance, a single phishing website captured 30 credit card records from 550 victim interactions over a 7-day period,” Prodaft wrote.\nProdaft’s report details how the Smishing Triad has achieved such success in sending their spam messages. For example, one phishing vendor appears to send out messages using dozens of Android device emulators running in parallel on a single machine.\nPhishers using multiple virtualized Android devices to orchestrate and distribute RCS-based scam campaigns. Image: Prodaft.\nAccording to Prodaft, the threat actors first acquire phone numbers through various means including data breaches, open-source intelligence, or purchased lists from underground markets. They then exploit technical gaps in sender ID validation within both messaging platforms.\n“For iMessage, this involves creating temporary Apple IDs with impersonated display names, while RCS exploitation leverages carrier implementation inconsistencies in sender verification,” Prodaft wrote. “Message delivery occurs through automated platforms using VoIP numbers or compromised credentials, often deployed in precisely timed multi-wave campaigns to maximize effectiveness.\nIn addition, the phishing links embedded in these messages use time-limited single-use URLs that expire or redirect based on device fingerprinting to evade security analysis, they found.\n“The economics strongly favor the attackers, as neither RCS nor iMessage messages incur per-message costs like traditional SMS, enabling high-volume campaigns at minimal operational expense,” Prodaft continued. “The overlap in templates, target pools, and tactics among these platforms underscores a unified threat landscape, with Chinese-speaking actors driving innovation in the underground economy. Their ability to scale operations globally and evasion techniques pose significant challenges to cybersecurity defenses.”\nFord Merrill works in security research at SecAlliance, a CSIS Security Group company. Merrill said he’s observed at least one video of a Windows binary that wraps a Chrome executable and can be used to load in target phone numbers and blast messages via RCS, iMessage, Amazon, Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\n“The evidence we’ve observed suggests the ability for a single device to send approximately 100 messages per second,” Merrill said. “We also believe that there is capability to source country specific SIM cards in volume that allow them to register different online accounts that require validation with specific country codes, and even make those SIM cards available to the physical devices long-term so that services that rely on checks of the validity of the phone number or SIM card presence on a mobile network are thwarted.”\nExperts say this fast-growing wave of card fraud persists because far too many financial institutions still default to sending one-time codes via SMS for validating card enrollment in mobile wallets from Apple or Google. KrebsOnSecurity interviewed multiple security executives at non-U.S. financial institutions who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Those banks have since done away with SMS-based one-time codes and are now requiring customers to log in to the bank’s mobile app before they can link their card to a digital wallet.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Thursday 10th of April 2025 11:31 AM \r\n         \nIf I had to install an app, I wouldn’t use NFC payments, and then I’d be less secure than before. There had better be a better way to authenticate than SMS or installing some proprietary garbage app from a bank to hand all my data to the adtech industry. When that day comes, it’ll be back to good old fashioned CASH for me.\n“Garbage app from a bank” > Garbage 1-shot SMS authentication, though.  \nIf your bank doesn’t put out an app you find “suitable”, A: What’s unsuitable about it specifically, B: How do you personally know, and C: Why would you continue your relationship with the bank whose apps you don’t trust for #reasons?  \nIf your bank doesn’t respect info privacy choices in their app chances are good they’re selling your info off the backend also, which again begs the question of why you would have a trust relationship with the bank you don’t trust.  \n*(Cash isn’t great for online transactions or large transactions.  I mean why not diamonds or gold, lol… crude oil…)\n@ A – Regarding the precious comment about using cash:\n  I am going to make a comment out of left field, which is not directly germane to\nthe topic of the story.  But it may inform a bit about the landscape of regular humans\nwho also fear many things virtual, and desire to retain CASH as a medium of exchange.\nThe folks I am specifically thinking about are fundamentalist Christians who have a narrative\nabout the “end times” and think that the “globalists” are  intentionally preparing to eliminate\n“cash money”, as a method of control of “we the people”.\nIf a person thinks the End Times are imminent, and a symptom or indicator of that\nwould be if the government tried to institute\na universal version of cypto-currency in order to institute  a “new global order”.   Most\nfundamentalist  Christians have a high degree of distrust of all of our institutions and our tech,\nand perhaps with a certain amount of reason.  If you are looking for any allies in keeping cash\navailable as a payment option, there are many on the right that would agree.\nText confirmation codes in general, or coming from your bank, do seem like a flaky way to do things.\npaint with a broad brush much?  Cash is a great way to go as it saves the merchant the fees that payment processors charge.  Not sure there’s a big overlap between believers of imminent end-times and people who use mainly cash for payments.\nSMS confirmation codes are a sad mistake.\nof course the US Gubmint is powerless to protect its citizens from such attacks and there is no ‘both sides’\nInterestingly I received this message today from an outlook domain account…\nApple Approval Notice\nWe have noticed that your Apple iCloud id was recently used at “APPLE STORE – CA” for $143.95, paid by Apple Pay Pre Authorization.\nAlso some suspicious sign in request and apple pay activation request detected.\nThat looks like suspicious to us. In order to maintain the security and privacy of your account we have placed those request on hold. Your Photos, Data, Bank\nInformation and Cards are at risk. If NOT you? talk to an Apple Representative.\nFailing may lead to auto debit and charge will not be reversed.

Successful exploitation of these flaws could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.\n\n\n\nThe security defects were identified in Junos OS components such as packet forwarding engine (pfe), flow daemon (flowd), routing protocol daemon (rpd), Anti-Virus processing, flexible PIC concentrator (FPC), jdhcpd daemon, web management interfaces, and syslog stream TCP transport.\n\n\n\nSome of these only impact specific Juniper devices, such as EX Series, MX Series, or SRX Series. Software updates were released for all impacted products, the company says.\n\n\n\nThe company also released fixes for 10 medium-severity vulnerabilities in Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, most of which could lead to DoS conditions.\n\n\n\nOne of the flaws, however, could allow a local, authenticated attacker with access to the command-line interface to obtain sensitive information.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Juniper also announced the release of Junos Space version 24.1R3 with fixes for nearly 50 vulnerabilities in third-party software. Some of these flaws are rated ‘critical severity’.\n\n\n\nJunos Space Security Director version 24.1R3 was also released with fixes for security defects in third-party dependencies, the same as CTP View version 9.2R1.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nFor most vulnerabilities, the company makes no mention of in-the-wild exploitation, while for others it specifically notes that it is not aware of malicious attacks targeting them. Additional information can be found on Juniper’s support portal page.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the company updated a March 2025 advisory for CVE-2025-21590, an improper isolation or compartmentalization vulnerability in Junos OS’s kernel that could be exploited by attackers with access to the shell to inject arbitrary code and compromise the device.\n\n\n\nThe update clarifies that, while Junos OS updates that resolve the bug have been released, certain devices will receive the necessary fixes in future platform iterations.\n\n\n\n“At least one instance of malicious exploitation has been reported to the Juniper SIRT.

Driven by increased threat actor focus, adversaries are rapidly exploiting new vulnerabilities in these devices through large-scale attack campaigns,” Forescout says.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, some of the most dangerous security defects are found in IoMT devices such as pump controllers, medication dispensing systems, and workstations.Advertisement.

Retail and healthcare are impacted the most, with over 70% of non-legacy Windows devices running Windows 10.\n\n\n\nForescout also underlines that special-purpose operating systems such as embedded firmware are more prevalent than mobile platforms across industries, with the healthcare, government, and manufacturing sectors having the highest concentration of such products.\n\n\n\nThe report also shows that organizations in the financial sector have the largest number of open ports on protocols such as SMB, RDP, SSH, and Telnet. Overall, Forescout has observed a decrease in the use of SSH, which provides encrypted communication, and an increase in the use of Telnet, which is not encrypted.\n\n\n\n“The attack surface in modern organizations now spans IT, IoT and OT, with IoMT adding another layer of complexity in healthcare.

First, security teams prioritize the vulnerabilities that need to be fixed, with security campaigns providing predefined templates for common themes (for instance, the most exploited types of flaws). Campaign alerts are selected and a timeline is specified.\n\n\n\nThen, developers impacted by the campaign are notified and the tasks related to patching vulnerabilities are brought into their workflow, enabling them to plan and manage them just like any other work. Advertisement.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nResearchers find vulnerabilities that can be exploited to remotely take control of a Nissan Leaf’s functions, including physical controls.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nResearchers have demonstrated that a series of vulnerabilities affecting the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle can be exploited to remotely hack the car, including for spying and the physical takeover of various functions. \nThe research was conducted by PCAutomotive, a company that offers penetration testing and threat intelligence services for the automotive and financial services industries. The Nissan Leaf hacking was detailed last week at Black Hat Asia 2025.\n\n\n\nPCAutomotive researchers targeted a second generation Nissan Leaf made in 2020. The vulnerabilities they found enabled them to use the infotainment system’s Bluetooth capabilities to infiltrate the car’s internal network.\n\n\n\nThey were then able to escalate privileges and establish a C&C channel over cellular communications to maintain stealthy and persistent access to the EV directly over the internet. \n\n\n\nThe researchers showed that an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities to spy on the owner by tracking the car’s location, taking screenshots of the infotainment system, and recording people talking in the vehicle.\n\n\n\nThey were also able to remotely take control of various physical functions, including doors, wipers, the horn, mirrors, windows, lights, and even the steering wheel, including while the car was in motion. \n\n\n\nThe vulnerabilities have been assigned eight CVE identifiers: CVE-2025-32056 through CVE-2025-32063. The disclosure process started in August 2023 and Nissan confirmed the findings in January 2024, but it took until recently to get the CVEs assigned, according to the researchers. \n\n\n\nContacted by SecurityWeek, a Nissan spokesperson commented, “PCAutomotive contacted Nissan regarding its research. While we decline to disclose specific countermeasures or details for security reasons, for the safety and peace of mind of our customers we will continue to develop and roll out technologies to combat increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nPCAutomotive has published a video showing how their exploits were used to remotely hack the Nissan Leaf. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomotive exploits can have a significant monetary value.

The name ‘ServiceWrap’ also stands out in its SEO domain naming.\n\n\n\nThe framework was designed to target websites with spam messages that can be indexed by search engines, and uses OpenAI services to generate tailored messages for each targeted website.\n\n\n\nThe analysis of archives containing AkiraBot scripts revealed that the framework has been active since September 2024, initially targeting Shopify, and progressively expanding to websites built using GoDaddy, Wix, Squarespace, and generic website contact forms.\n\n\n\n“These technologies are primarily used by small- to medium-sized businesses for their ease in enabling website development with integrations for eCommerce, website content management, and business service offerings,” SentinelOne’s SentinelLabs says.\n\n\n\nThe cybersecurity firm identified multiple versions of the framework, all using hardcoded OpenAI API keys, as well as the same proxy credentials and test sites.\n\n\n\nIn AkiraBot’s user interface, the operator can view attack metrics, select a list of websites to target, and choose how many sites to be targeted concurrently.\n\n\n\nSpam messages are generated based on a template containing a generic outline, which is served to the OpenAI chat API. The OpenAI client is instructed to act as an assistant that generates marketing messages.Advertisement.

The benefit of generating each message using an LLM is that the message content is unique and filtering against spam becomes more difficult compared to using a consistent message template which can trivially be filtered,” SentinelLabs explains.\n\n\n\nTo evade CAPTCHA services, including hCAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, AkiraBot intercepts the website loading process using the Selenium WebDriver automated framework, which also simulates legitimate user activity. As a failover, it uses CAPTCHA bypassing services such as Capsolver, FastCaptcha, and NextCaptcha.\n\n\n\nFor network detection evasion, the bot relies on proxy hosts, and each of the identified iterations has used the SmartProxy service with the same credentials.\n\n\n\nAkiraBot is logging success metrics, which helped SentinelLab identify over 80,000 unique domains successfully spammed by the framework, and more than 420,000 unique domains that have been targeted since September 2024.\n\n\n\nThe Akira and ServiceWrap SEO services that appear in the framework’s messages have numerous 5-star reviews on TrustPilot, all with similar, likely AI-generated content. They also have 1-star reviews with complaints about the service being either a scam or spamming the reviewer.\n\n\n\n“AkiraBot is a sprawling framework that has undergone multiple iterations to integrate new spamming target technologies and evade website defenses. We expect this campaign to continue to evolve as website hosting providers adapt defenses to deter spam,” SentinelLab says.\n\n\n\nRelated: Sites of Major Orgs Abused in Spam Campaign Exploiting Virtual Tour Software Flaw\nRelated: Critical Vulnerabilities Found in Anti-Spam Plugin Used by 200,000 WordPress Sites\nRelated: Scareware Combined With Phishing in Attacks Targeting macOS Users\nRelated: ClickFix Widely Adopted by Cybercriminals, APT Groups\n\nDubbed AkiraBot due to its use of domains that have ‘Akira’ as the search engine optimization (SEO) service brand, the framework can evade CAPTCHA filters and network detections.
