        "Content": "Exposed PostgreSQL instances are the target of an ongoing campaign designed to gain unauthorized access and deploy cryptocurrency miners.\nCloud security firm Wiz said the activity is a variant of an intrusion set that was first flagged by Aqua Security in August 2024 that involved the use of a malware strain dubbed\nPG_MEM\n. The campaign has been attributed to a threat actor Wiz tracks as JINX-0126.\n\"The threat actor has since evolved, implementing defense evasion techniques such as deploying binaries with a unique hash per target and executing the miner payload filelessly – likely to evade detection by [cloud workload protection platform] solutions that rely solely on file hash reputation,\" researchers Avigayil Mechtinger, Yaara Shriki, and Gili Tikochinski\nsaid\n.\nWiz has also revealed that the campaign has likely claimed over 1,500 victims to date, indicating that publicly-exposed PostgreSQL instances with weak or predictable credentials are prevalent enough to become an attack target for opportunistic threat actors.\nThe most distinctive aspect of the campaign is the abuse of the COPY ... FROM PROGRAM SQL command to execute arbitrary shell commands on the host.\nThe access afforded by the successful exploitation of weakly configured PostgreSQL services is used to conduct preliminary reconnaissance and drop a Base64-encoded payload, which, in reality, is a shell script that kills competing cryptocurrency miners and drops a binary named PG_CORE.\nAlso downloaded to the server is an obfuscated Golang binary codenamed postmaster that\nmimics\nthe legitimate PostgreSQL multi-user database server. It's designed to set up persistence on the host using a cron job, create a new role with elevated privileges, and write another binary called cpu_hu to disk.\ncpu_hu, for its part, downloads the latest version of the\nXMRig miner\nfrom GitHub and launches it filelessly via a known Linux fileless technique referred to as\nmemfd\n.\n\"The threat actor is assigning a unique mining worker to each victim,\" Wiz said, adding it identified three different wallets linked to the threat actor. \"Each wallet had approximately 550 workers. Combined, this suggests that the campaign could have leveraged over 1,500 compromised machines.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "On the\n21st birthday of Gmail\n, Google has announced a major update that allows enterprise users to send end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) to any user in any email inbox in a few clicks.\nThe feature is rolling out starting today in beta, allowing users to send E2EE emails to Gmail users within an organization, with plans to send E2EE emails to any Gmail inbox in the coming weeks and to any email inbox later this year.\nWhat makes the new encryption model – an alternative to the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (\nS/MIME\n) protocol – stand out is that it eliminates the need for senders or recipients to use custom software or exchange encryption certificates.\n\"This capability, requiring minimal efforts for both IT teams and end users, abstracts away the traditional IT complexity and substandard user experiences of existing solutions, while preserving enhanced data sovereignty, privacy, and security controls,\" Google Workspace's Johney Burke and Julien Duplant\nsaid\n.\nThe technology that powers E2EE emails is client-side encryption (CSE), which Google has\nalready rolled out\nto Gmail and other services like Calendar, Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Meet.\nThus when an E2EE email is sent to another Gmail recipient, the message is automatically decrypted on the other end. In the case of a non-Gmail recipient (e.g., Microsoft Outlook), the Google email platform sends them an invitation to view the E2EE email in a restricted version of Gmail, which can be accessed via a guest Google Workspace account to securely view and respond to the message.\nThe fact that this is driven by CSE means that data gets encrypted on the client before it is transmitted or stored in Google's cloud-based storage, thereby making it indecipherable to other third-party entities, including Google.\nThat said, one\ncrucial difference\nbetween CSE and E2EE is that the clients use encryption keys that are generated and stored in a cloud-based key management service, thus allowing an organisation's administrator to control the keys, revoke a user's access to the keys, and even monitor encrypted files.\n\"First, at a structural level this approach offers more comprehensive encryption protection,\" Burke and Deplane said. \"It doesn't matter who you send a message to, what email they are using, your message will be encrypted and you are in sole control. There's just one set of keys, and you're the only one who has them.\"\n\"Second, it's simple and easy to implement and use. It reduces friction for both IT teams and users, as no one has to be an encryption savant to make this work. It'll save teams tons of time and money, and finally give them a path to what everyone craves: email encryption that is painless and just works.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The developer of Lucid is a threat actor codenamed LARVA-242, who is also a key figure in the XinXin group.\nAll three PhaaS platforms share overlaps in templates, target pools, and tactics, alluding to a flourishing underground economy where Chinese-speaking actors are leveraging Telegram to advertise their warez on a subscription basis for profit-driven motives.\nPhishing campaigns relying on these services have been found to impersonate postal services, courier companies, toll payment systems, and tax refund agencies, employing convincing phishing templates to deceive victims into providing sensitive information.\nThe large-scale activities are powered on the backend via iPhone device farms and mobile device emulators running on Windows systems to send hundreds of thousands of scam messages containing bogus links in a coordinated fashion. The phone numbers to be targeted are acquired through various methods such as data breaches and cybercrime forums.\n\"For iMessage's link-clicking restrictions, they\nemploy\n'please reply with Y' techniques to establish two-way communication,\" PRODAFT explained. \"For Google's RCS filtering, they constantly rotate sending domains/numbers to avoid pattern recognition.\"\n\"For iMessage, this involves creating temporary Apple IDs with impersonated display names, while RCS exploitation leverages carrier implementation inconsistencies in sender verification.\"\nBesides offering automation tools that simplify the creation of customizable phishing websites, the pages themselves incorporate advanced anti-detection and evasion techniques like IP blocking, user-agent filtering, and time-limited single-use URLs.\nLucid also supports the ability to monitor victim activity and record every single interaction with the phishing links in real-time via a panel, allowing its customers to extract the entered information. Credit card details submitted by victims are subjected to additional verification steps. The panel is built using the open-source Webman PHP framework.\n\"The Lucid PhaaS panel has revealed a highly organized and interconnected ecosystem of phishing-as-a-service platforms operated by Chinese-speaking threat actors, primarily under the XinXin group,\" the company said.\n\"The XinXin group develops and utilizes these tools and profits from selling stolen credit card information while actively monitoring and supporting the development of similar PhaaS services.\"\nIt's worth noting that the\nfindings\nfrom PRODAFT mirror that of Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, which\nrecently\ncalled out unspecified threat actors for utilizing the domain pattern \"com-\" to register over 10,000 domains for propagating various SMS phishing scams via Apple iMessage.\nThe development comes as Barracuda warned of a \"massive spike\" in PhaaS attacks in early 2025 using\nTycoon 2FA\n,\nEvilProxy\n, and\nSneaky 2FA\n, with each service accounting for 89%, 8%, and 3% of all the PhaaS incidents, respectively.\n\"Phishing emails are the gateway for many attacks, from credential theft to financial fraud, ransomware, and more,\" Barracuda security researcher Deerendra Prasad\nsaid\n. \"The platforms that power phishing-as-a-service are increasingly complex and evasive, making phishing attacks both harder for traditional security tools to detect and more powerful in terms of the damage they can do.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The latter is launched by means of a loader dubbed MASQLOADER, or via RSBINJECT, a Rust-based command-line shellcode loader.\nSubsequent iterations of MASQLOADER have also been observed implementing an anti-API hooking technique that overwrites any\nNTDLL.dll hooks\ninserted by security programs to detect suspicious processes running on Windows, thereby allowing the malware and the embedded payload within it to fly under the radar.\nThe execution of VARGEIT results in the deployment of more tools, including a loader component codenamed RAILLOAD that's executed using a technique known as DLL side-loading, and is used for running an encrypted payload located in a different folder.\nThe second payload is a persistence and\ntimestomping\nmodule referred to as RAILSETTER that alters the timestamps associated with RAILLOAD artifacts on the compromised host, alongside creating a scheduled task to launch RAILLOAD.\nVARGEIT and controller interaction\n\"MASQLOADER is also being used by other groups besides Earth Alux,\" Trend Micro said. \"Additionally, the difference in MASQLOADER's code structure compared to other tools such as RAILSETTER and RAILLOAD suggests that MASQLOADER's development is separate from those toolsets.\"\nThe most distinctive aspect of VARGEIT is its ability to support 10 different channels for C&C communications over HTTP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, and Microsoft Outlook, the last of which leverages the\nGraph API\nto exchange commands in a predetermined format using the drafts folder of an attacker-managed mailbox.\nSpecifically, the message from the C&C server is prepended with r_, while those from the backdoor are prefixed with p_. Among its wide range of functions is the extensive data collection and command execution, which makes it a potent malware in the threat actor's arsenal.\n\"Earth Alux conducts several tests with RAILLOAD and RAILSETTER,\" Trend Micro said. \"These include detection tests and attempts to find new hosts for DLL side-loading. DLL side-loading tests involve ZeroEye, an open source tool popular within the Chinese-speaking community, for scanning EXE files' import tables for imported DLLs that can be abused for side-loading.\"\nThe hacking group has also been found to utilize VirTest, another testing tool widely used by the Chinese-speaking community, to ensure that its tools are stealthy enough to maintain long-term access to target environments.\n\"Earth Alux represents a sophisticated and evolving cyberespionage threat, leveraging a diverse toolkit and advanced techniques to infiltrate and compromise a range of sectors, particularly in the APAC region and Latin America,\" the researchers concluded. \"The group's ongoing testing and development of its tools further indicate a commitment to refining its capabilities and evading detection.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Learn about the detection process, response strategies, and steps taken to mitigate this critical issue. Download the full case study\nhere\n.\nBy implementing Reflectiz's recommendations, the retailer avoided the following:\nPotential GDPR fines (up to €20M or 4% of turnover)\n$3.9M data breach cost [on average]\n5% customer churn\nIntroduction\nYou might not know much about CSRF tokens, but as an online retailer, you need to know enough to avoid any accidental oversharing of them by the Facebook Pixel. Getting this wrong could mean enormous fines from data protection regulators, so the purpose of this article is to give you a brief overview of the problem and explain the best way to protect your business against it.\nYou can explore this key issue in greater depth by downloading our free new case study on the subject [\nfrom here\n]. It goes through a real-world example of when this happened to a global online apparel and lifestyle retailer. It explains the issue they faced in more detail, but this article is a bite-sized overview of the threat to get you up to speed.\nLet's take a deeper look at how this issue unfolded and why it matters for online security.\nWhat happened and why it matters\nIn a nutshell, a web threat monitoring solution called Reflectiz discovered a data leak in the retailer's systems that others didn't: its Facebook Pixel was oversharing a security technology called CSRF tokens that it should've kept under wraps.\nCSRF tokens were invented to stop CSRF, which stands for\ncross-site request forgery\n. It's a type of cyberattack that involves tricking a web application into performing certain actions by convincing it that they came from an authenticated user.\nEssentially, it exploits the trust that the web application has in the user's browser.\nHere's how it works:\nThe victim is logged into a trusted website (for instance, their online banking).\nThe attacker creates a malicious link or script and tricks the victim into clicking it (this could happen via email, social media, or another website).\nThe malicious link sends a request to the trusted website. Since the victim is already authenticated, their browser automatically includes their\nsession cookies\nor credentials, making the request appear legitimate to the web application.\nAs a result, the web application will carry out the action in the attacker's malicious request, such as transferring funds or changing account details, without the victim's consent.\n[Note that this is not a malicious activity event. All 'blockers' that monitor the traffic for malicious scripts would not detect any issues.]\nDevelopers can use various tools to stop this happening, and one of them is CSRF tokens. They ensure that authenticated users only perform the actions they intend to, not the ones requested by attackers.\nReflectiz recommended storing CSRF tokens in HttpOnly cookies, which prevents third-party scripts, like Facebook Pixel, from accessing them.\nThe misconfiguration problem\nIn the case study example [that you can find\nhere\n] the retailer's Facebook Pixel had been\naccidentally misconfigured\n. The misconfiguration allowed the pixel to inadvertently access CSRF tokens—critical security elements that prevent unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users. These tokens were exposed, creating a serious security vulnerability. This breach risked multiple security issues, including potential data leaks and unauthorized actions on behalf of users.\nLike many online retailers, your website will probably use the Facebook Pixel to track visitor activities to optimize its Facebook advertising, but it should only be gathering and sharing the information it requires for that purpose, and it should only be doing so after obtaining the correct user permissions. Since CSRF tokens should never be shared with any third party, that's impossible!\nHere's how Reflectiz's technology works to uncover such vulnerabilities before they turn into serious security risks.\nThe Fix\nReflectiz's automated security platform was employed to monitor the retailer's web environment. During a routine scan, Reflectiz identified an anomaly with the Facebook Pixel. It was found to be interacting with the page incorrectly, accessing CSRF tokens and other sensitive data. Through continuous monitoring and deep behavioral analysis, Reflectiz detected this unauthorized data transmission within hours of the breach. This was a bit like sharing the keys to their house or the password to their bank account. They're actions that others could exploit in the future.\nReflectiz acted swiftly, providing a detailed report to the retailer. The report outlined the misconfiguration and recommended immediate actions, such as configuration changes to Facebook Pixel code, to stop the Pixel from accessing sensitive data.\nData protection\nregulators take a dim view of your business even if it accidentally overshares this kind of restricted information with unauthorized third parties, and fines can easily run into millions of dollars. That's why the 10 to 11 minutes it will take you to\nread the full case study\ncould be the best time investment you make all year.\nNext Steps\nReflectiz's recommendations didn't just stop with immediate fixes; they laid the foundation for ongoing security improvements and long-term protection. Here's how you can protect your business from similar risks:\nRegular Security Audits:\nContinuous Monitoring: Implement a system of\ncontinuous monitoring\nto track all third-party scripts and their behavior on your website. This will help you detect potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in real-time, preventing security risks before they escalate.\nPeriodic Security Audits: Schedule regular audits to ensure that all security measures are up to date. This includes checking for vulnerabilities in your third-party integrations and ensuring compliance with the latest security standards and best practices.\nThird-Party Script Management:\nEvaluate and Control Third-Party Scripts: Review all third-party scripts on your website, such as tracking pixels and analytics tools. Limit the access these scripts have to sensitive data and ensure they only receive the data necessary for their function.\nUse Trusted Partners: Only work with third-party vendors that meet stringent security and privacy standards. Ensure that their security practices align with your business's needs to prevent unauthorized data sharing.\nCSRF Token Protection:\nHttpOnly Cookies: Follow Reflectiz's recommendation to store CSRF tokens in HttpOnly cookies, which prevents JavaScript (including third-party scripts) from accessing them. This is a key measure in protecting tokens from unauthorized access by third-party vendors.\nEnforce Secure Cookie Attributes: Ensure that all CSRF tokens are stored with Secure and SameSite=Strict attributes to protect them from being sent in cross-origin requests and mitigate the risk of exposure through malicious third-party scripts.\nPrivacy by Design:\nIntegrate Privacy into Your Development Process: As part of your development and deployment processes, adopt a\nPrivacy by Design approach\n. Ensure that privacy considerations are at the forefront, from the way data is stored to the way third-party scripts interact with your site.\nUser Consent Management: Regularly update your data collection practices, ensuring users have control over what data they share. Always obtain clear, informed consent before sharing any sensitive data with third parties.\nEducate Your Team:\nSecurity Training: Make sure your development and security teams are well-trained in the latest security protocols, especially related to data privacy and CSRF protection. Awareness and understanding of security risks are the first steps to preventing issues like this.\nCross-Department Collaboration: Ensure that marketing and security teams are aligned, especially when using third-party tools like the Facebook Pixel. Both teams should work together to ensure that security and privacy concerns are considered when implementing such tools.\nAdopt a Zero-Trust Approach:\nZero-Trust Security Model: Consider adopting a Zero-Trust approach to security. This model assumes that all users, both inside and outside the network, are untrusted and verifies each request before granting access. By applying this philosophy to data exchanges between your site and third-party services, you can minimize exposure to risks.\nBy implementing these next steps, you can proactively strengthen your security posture, safeguard your sensitive data, and prevent similar issues in the future. Reflectiz's insights provide the roadmap to build a more resilient and secure web environment. Protecting your business from emerging threats is an ongoing effort, but with the right processes and tools in place, you can ensure that your systems remain secure and compliant.\nDownload the full case study here.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Apple has been hit with a fine of €150 million ($162 million) by France's competition watchdog over the implementation of its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy framework.\nThe Autorité de la concurrence said it's imposing a financial penalty against Apple for abusing its dominant position as a distributor of mobile applications for iOS and iPadOS devices between April 26, 2021 and July 25, 2023.\nATT,\nintroduced\nby the iPhone maker with iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and tvOS 14.5, is a\nframework\nthat requires mobile apps to seek users' explicit consent in order to access their device's unique advertising identifier (i.e., the Identifier for Advertisers or\nIDFA\n) and track them across apps and websites for purposes targeted advertising.\n\"Unless you receive permission from the user to enable tracking, the device's advertising identifier value will be all zeros and you may not track them,\" Apple\nnotes\non its website. \"While you can display the AppTrackingTransparency prompt whenever you choose, the device's advertising identifier value will only be returned once you present the prompt and the user grants permission.\"\nApp developers, besides requesting for permission to track the users, are also required to state the purpose behind why such tracking is necessary in the first place.\n\"While the objective of the App Tracking Transparency ('ATT') framework is not at its core problematic, how ATT is implemented is neither necessary for nor proportionate with Apple's stated objective of protecting personal data,\" it\nsaid\n.\nDescribing ATT as \"artificially complex,\" the regulatory authority said the consent obtained via the framework does not meet the legal obligations required under the French Data Protection Act, requiring developers to use their own consent collection solutions. This, it added, leads to multiple consent pop-ups being displayed to users.\nThe Autorité also called out two kinds of asymmetry in how it's implemented. One of them concerns the fact that consent for tracking must be confirmed by the users twice, whereas refusal is a one-step process -- an aspect that it said undermines the \"neutrality of the framework.\"\n\"While publishers were required to obtain double consent from users for tracking on third-party sites and applications, Apple did not ask for consent from users of its own applications (until the implementation of iOS 15),\" it pointed out. \"Due to this asymmetry, the\nCNIL fined Apple\nfor infringing Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act, which transposes the ePrivacy Directive.\"\n\"The asymmetry remains today insofar as Apple has introduced a single\n'Personalized Advertising' pop-up\nto collect user consent for its own data collection, while continuing to require double consent for third-party data collection by publishers.\"\nIt's worth noting that the order does not impose any specific changes to the framework. According to\nReuters\n, it's \"up to the company to make sure it now complied with the ruling.\" The fine is chump change for Apple, which earned a net income of $36.3 billion on revenues of $124.3 billion in the quarter ending December 28, 2024.\nIn a\nstatement\nshared with the Associated Press, Cupertino said the ATT prompt is consistent for all developers, including itself, and that it has received \"strong support\" for the feature from consumers, privacy advocates, and data protection authorities globally.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "​North Korea's IT workers have expanded operations beyond the United States and are now increasingly targeting organizations across Europe.\nAlso referred to as \"IT warriors,\" they hide their true identities and pose as workers based in other countries by connecting via laptop farms to fraudulently secure positions as remote freelance IT employees at companies worldwide to generate revenue for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) regime.\nAs security researchers with the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) found, North Korea's IT army has increasingly targeted positions at companies in Germany, Portugal, and the United Kingdom after many of its members have been charged and targeted with sanctions in the United States.\n\"In their efforts to secure these positions, DPRK IT workers employed deceptive tactics, falsely claiming nationalities from a diverse set of countries, including Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Ukraine, the United States, and Vietnam. The identities used were a combination of real and fabricated personas,\"\nsaid Jamie Collier\n, a lead threat intelligence advisor at GTIG.\n\"IT workers in Europe were recruited through various online platforms, including Upwork, Telegram, and Freelancer. Payment for their services was facilitated through cryptocurrency, the TransferWise service, and Payoneer, highlighting the use of methods that obfuscate the origin and destination of funds.\"\nCountries targeted by DPRK IT workers (GTIG)\n​For instance, GTIG investigators discovered user credentials at European job websites and human capital management platforms linked to DRPK IT worker personas looking for employment at German and Portuguese companies. North Korean IT workers have also been linked to many projects in the United Kingdom, ranging from AI and blockchain technology to web, bot, and content management system (CMS) development.\nAnother DPRK IT worker targeted multiple European organizations in the defense industrial base and government sectors in late 2024 using fabricated references and personas to make it easier to trick job recruiters into hiring them.\n\"We are increasingly seeing North Korean IT workers infiltrating larger organizations to steal sensitive data and follow through on their extortion threats against these enterprises,\" Michael Barnhart, a Mandiant Principal Analyst at Google Cloud, told BleepingComputer in January.\n\"It's also unsurprising to see them expanding their operations into Europe to replicate their success, as it's easier to entrap citizens who aren't familiar with their ploy.\"\nOn September 12, 2024, the United Kingdom's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation\nissued an advisory on North Korean IT workers\nwith info on how potential targets can mitigate their risk exposure and warning that individuals and organizations who hire them could be breaching\nfinancial sanctions\n.\nU.S. crackdown on DPRK IT work schemes\nGTIG's report follows\nmultiple warnings\nissued by the FBI regarding North Korea's\nmassive army of IT workers\nsent abroad to generate revenue, who have tricked\nhundreds of companies\nin the United States and worldwide into hiring them over the years. However, the North Korean regime keeps up to 90% of wages collected this way, generating hundreds of millions every year to fund its weapons programs.\nAfter being discovered and fired, some of these undercover North Korean IT workers have also used insider knowledge to\nextort former employers\n, threatening to leak sensitive information stolen from company systems.\nIn January, the U.S. Justice Department\nindicted two North Korean nationals\nand three facilitators for their involvement in a multi-year fraudulent remote IT work scheme involving at least sixty-four U.S. companies between April 2018 and August 2024.\nThe Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\nalso sanctioned North Korean front companies\nlinked to North Korea's Ministry of National Defense and accused of generating revenue via illegal remote IT work schemes.

        "Summary": "A RAR file, a fake summons, and a Nietzsche quote—all part of a multi-stage malware chain delivering DCRat & Rhadamanthys. Acronis TRU breaks down how attackers use VBS, batch, and PowerShell scripts to slip past defenses. [...]",
        "Date": "2025-04-01",
        "Content": "The Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU) was presented with an interesting threat chain and malware sample for analysis that involved a known cyberthreat along with some interesting twists in targeting and obfuscation.\nIn this article, we’ll dissect the complex malware delivery chain and tactics. The focus will be on a multi-stage infection process involving Visual Basic Script (VBS), a batch file, and a PowerShell script, ultimately leading to the deployment of high-profile malware like DCRat or Rhadamanthys infostealer.\nInitial Infection: The Deceptive Email Attachment\nThe infection begins with a seemingly innocuous email. The message contains a RAR archive attachment, cleverly named “Citación por embargo de cuenta,” which translates to “Summons for account garnishment.”\nThis filename is designed to evoke immediate concern and prompt Spanish-speaking recipients to open the attachment. Once the RAR archive is extracted, it reveals a Visual Basic script (VBS) file.\nWhen executed, this VBS file initiates a multistage delivery process, setting the stage for the deployment of the final malicious payload.\nThe Multi-Stage Delivery Process\nThe VBS file is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult for traditional security solutions to detect its malicious intent.\nUpon execution, the VBS script generates a Windows batch file (BAT) and transfers control to it. This batch file is the next link in the chain, responsible for constructing a Base64 encoded string from environment variables.\nThis string represents a compact PowerShell script, which is then executed using the -command argument.\nThe PowerShell script plays a crucial role in the delivery chain. It reads the last line of the batch file, removes marker bytes, and decodes the resulting payload.\nThe decoded payload is a Windows .NET executable, which is loaded into memory using a common malware technique known as RunPE, facilitated by a helper library.\nThe payload itself is packed using a custom .NET packer and is heavily obfuscated, containing two encrypted data blobs within its resource structure.\nThese data blobs can be decrypted using a byte-by-byte XOR operation with the key 0x78 — this process is also common in cryptography.\nRisks and Evading Detection\nThe deployment of high-profile malware like DCRat or Rhadamanthys infostealer through this complex delivery chain poses significant risks.\nThe multi-stage process, involving multiple script languages and obfuscation techniques, can effectively bypass security solutions, leading to unauthorized access, data theft, and system compromise.\nThe complexity of the delivery chain introduces multiple layers of obfuscation, making it challenging for security solutions to detect and block the malware at each step.\nHowever, the added complexity also introduces more points of failure, which can be exploited to break the chain and prevent the final payload from being executed.\nMultilayered Security Solutions: A Comprehensive Defense\nTo combat such sophisticated threats, multilayered security solutions are essential. These solutions employ a variety of techniques at different stages of the infection process.\nFor instance, during the initial stages, they can detect and block malicious emails and attachments, preventing the execution of the Visual Basic script.\nAdvanced heuristics and behavior analysis can identify obfuscated scripts and suspicious activities, such as the creation of batch files and PowerShell scripts in user directories.\nThe Acronis Threat Research Unit analyzes threats like DCRat as a part of our ongoing research and development work to ensure that our security solutions — such as Acronis Advanced Security + Extended Detection and Response (XDR) — are prepared for emerging threats.\nAcronis XDR leverages real-time protection and in-house-developed generic script emulators to de-obfuscate and analyze scripts, allowing for early detection and neutralization of threats. By monitoring and blocking the execution of encoded payloads in memory, these solutions can prevent the loading of final malware like DCRat, Rhadamanthys, or Remcos.\nKey Findings, Insights and a 19th Century German Philosopher\nThe analysis of this malware delivery chain by the Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU) has yielded several key findings. One notable, and perhaps unique, aspect of the analysis is the inclusion of philosophical quotes from Friedrich Nietzsche in the PowerShell script, likely used as a distraction.\nAs the files were de-obfuscated, the following famous quotations appeared as plain text:\n\"There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.\"\n\"In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs, it is the rule.\"\n“In heaven, all the interesting people are missing.”\nAfter which, addition de-obfuscation was required to dig down to the malicious code.\nThis detail highlights the creativity and sophistication of modern malware authors. Despite these challenges, the Acronis TRU successfully detected and neutralized the components involved.\nAcronis Threat Research Unit's detailed analysis of DCRat provides a comprehensive understanding of this new threat, including secure code samples and screenshots. For a deep dive into the methodology and code in this attack, you can access the complete\ntechnical write up here\n.\nFor more information on the Acronis Threat Research Unit or to follow the latest alerts and updates, access the\nresearch blog here\n.\nSponsored and written by\nAcronis\n."

        "Content": "Autorité de la concurrence, France's antitrust watchdog, has fined Apple €150 million ($162 million) for using the App Tracking Transparency privacy framework to abuse its dominant market position in mobile app advertising on its devices.\nApp Tracking Transparency (ATT)\nrequires apps to request users' permission to collect their data for targeted advertising purposes before tracking them across websites, apps, and services owned by other companies. Apple introduced the data privacy tool in June 2020 and began enforcing its use in April 2021 with the release of iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5.\nThe French competition authority said that although ATT's goal is not inherently problematic, its implementation is neither necessary nor proportionate to Apple's declared objective of protecting its customers' personal information.\n\"ATT as implemented by Apple penalised smaller publishers in particular since, unlike the main vertically integrated platforms, they depend to a large extent on third-party data collection to finance their business,\"\nthe competition regulator said\n.\n\"Although the introduction of ATT has impacted all application publishers, the framework has been particularly harmful for smaller publishers that do not enjoy alternative targeting possibilities, in particular in the absence of sufficient proprietary data.\"\nAs the French competition watchdog explained, the ATT framework fails to comply with GDPR standards due to its lack of neutrality and the overly complicated user experience it implements.\nUsing multiple consent pop-ups puts app publishers at a disadvantage, as users must confirm tracking consent twice but can easily refuse it with a single click, the Autorité de la concurrence said.\nATT also creates an imbalance, given that user access to Apple apps is easier because the company exempts its apps from the regulations that third-party app publishers must follow or provide access to their apps.\nApp Tracking Transparency framework issues (Autorité de la concurrence)\n​\"As part of its investigation into the merits of the case, the Autorité found that while the objective of the App Tracking Transparency (\"ATT\") framework is not at its core problematic, how ATT is implemented is neither necessary for nor proportionate with Apple's stated objective of protecting personal data,\" the watchdog said.\n\"While the principle of the ATT framework is not problematic in terms of the likely benefits for users as regards privacy protection, the Autorité found that how the framework is implemented is abusive within the meaning of competition law, in particular as the implementation methods artificially complicate the use of third-party applications and distort the neutrality of the framework to the detriment of small publishers financed by advertising.\"\nGiven the seriousness of the facts, Apple's economic power, and the duration of the infringement (between 26 April 2021 and 25 July 2023), the French competition watchdog imposed a fine of €150 million and also ordered Apple to publish the decision's summary on its website for seven consecutive days.\nThe fine comes one year after the\nEuropean Commission fined Apple €1.8 billion\n(roughly $1.95 billion) for abusing its dominant market position to prevent other music streaming services from promoting cheaper services outside its App Store.\nTwo years ago,\nFrance's data protection authority (CNIL) also fined Apple €8 million\n($8.5 million) for collecting user data for targeted advertising on the App Store without consent.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nApple blames Spotify for $1.95 billion fine over \"abusive\" App store rules\nApple backports zero-day patches to older iPhones and Macs\nVivaldi integrates Proton VPN into the browser to fight web tracking\nUK fines software provider £3.07 million for 2022 ransomware breach\n23andMe files for bankruptcy, customers advised to delete DNA data"

The email will be automatically decrypted when the recipient is a Gmail user with an enterprise or personal account.\nRecipients using Google's Gmail mobile app or non-Gmail email clients will receive a link to sign in and view the email in a restricted version of Gmail. The recipient can then use a guest Google Workspace account to view and reply to the encrypted message.\nHowever, when the recipient has S/MIME configured on their account, Gmail will automatically send an E2EE email via S/MIME (just as it does today).\nGmail's new E2EE capability is powered by the\nclient-side encryption\n(CSE) Workspace technical control that enables organizations to use encryption keys stored outside Google's servers and under their control to protect sensitive emails and documents,\nThis ensures that all transmitted data is encrypted on the client before being sent to Google's cloud-based storage, which helps meet regulatory requirements, such as data sovereignty, HIPAA, and export controls, by rendering it indecipherable to Google and third-party entities.\nGmail CSE has been available for Google Workspace Enterprise Plus, Education Plus, and Education Standard customers\nsince February 2023\n, and was\nintroduced in Gmail on the web\nas a beta test in December 2022 after an initial rollout to Google Drive, Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Google Meet, and Google Calendar (in beta).\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft fixes button that restores classic Outlook client\nGoogle fixes flaw that could unmask YouTube users' email addresses\nGoogle fixes Chrome zero-day exploited in espionage campaign\nStop Googling how to use Teams or Docs — Get this course deal instead\nGoogle Gemini's Astra (screen sharing) rolls out on Android for some users"

The mere presence of this service without letting the user know is not a good practice and can be seen as malicious.”\n\n\n\n“The decision to enable such functionality should always remain with the user, not the manufacturer,” Makris and Finisterre wrote in the report.\n\n\n\nThe device, which retails in the US for less than $4,000, also contains remnants of an older, inactive codebase for an alternative tunnel client, suggesting leftover development artifacts.\n\n\n\nThe researchers say data from the CloudSail API revealed that a total of 1,919 devices have connected to this service at some point, although only two remain currently active.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“By using our own tunnel manager tool we are able to create a tunnel to any active client,” the researchers explained, noting they gained access to active clients that provided direct access to the robot’s web interface and live camera streams without the need for login credentials.\n\n\n\nAccording to a post-mortem report, the robot dogs are also being shipped shipped with default SSH credentials. If these are not changed, attackers could gain access to the underlying Raspberry Pi, opening a pathway for lateral movement within local networks.\n\n\n\nThe discovery of this undocumented tunnel service, deployed without user notification or consent, represents a significant security risk, the researchers warned, noting the potential for remote exploitation at sensitive environments where these robot dogs might be used. \n\n\n\nThe report also raises concerns that similar backdoors could exist in other Unitree products, including newer models like the Go2 or the company’s humanoid robots.\n\n\n\nThe researchers said the discovery raises numerous questions about the company’s intent. “Did Unitree want to include this for China only? Did they plan to roll out a remote control service to the public but never follow through? If it was meant for China only, why do all robot dogs around the world automatically enroll in the tunnel service? Is it intentional or just sloppy? Is this unfinished tunnel payment page just an excuse in case someone notices that there is a tunnel client pre-installed on the dogs?”\n\n\n\n“We strongly advise everyone with such a robot to remove it from the network permanently, as well as examine all available logs to check if their network was breached,” the research team declared.\n\n\n\nRelated: Academics Devise Cyber Intrusion Detection System for Unmanned Robots\nRelated: New ‘LidarPhone’ Attack Uses Robot Vacuum Cleaners for Eavesdropping\nRelated: Legacy Programming Languages Pose Serious Risks to Industrial Robots\nRelated: Industrial Robotics – Are You Increasing Your Cybersecurity Risk?\nRelated: Flaws Open Telepresence Robots to Prying Eyes\n\nAccording to documentation published by researchers Andreas Makris and Kevin Finisterre, the quadruped robot developed by the Chinese cvompany Unitree Robotics contains the undocumented tunnel service that automatically pings unitree.com to initiate its connection if a certain variable is enabled.\n\n\n\nThe researchers say the tunnel service uses CloudSail, a remote access solution developed by China-based Zhexi Technology.  While CloudSail is normally intended for legitimate remote management of devices, it is being used to grant external access to the robot dog.\n\n\n\n“Anybody with access to the API key can freely access all robot dogs on the tunnel network, remotely control them, use the vision cameras to see through their eyes or even hop on the RPI via ssh,” the researcher warned.\n\n\n\n“If this was abused or not does not matter in this case.

These patterns often coincide with new vulnerabilities emerging 2 to 4 weeks later,” GreyNoise VP Bob Rudis said.\n\n\n\nMost of the attacks originate from the US, where more than 16,000 of the identified IPs are located. Canada comes in second with over 5,800 IPs. The scanning activity mainly targets the US, with a small percentage of the scans targeting the UK, Ireland, Russia, and Singapore.\n\n\n\nGreyNoise also notes that over 20,000 of the identified IPs are associated with 3xK Tech GmbH, under ASN200373.

According to a post from Hudson Rock co-founder and CTO Alon Gal, the screenshots appear genuine, especially since the hacker has a record of legitimate leaks.\n\n\n\nStarting mid-March, CoreInjection announced the sale of data allegedly stolen from five companies, most of them in Israel, suggesting a focus on the country. The asking prices for the other four listings range between $30,000 and $100,000.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Check Point responded to the hacker’s claims, saying that the data did not come from a fresh breach and that the threat actor is greatly exaggerating the importance of the exfiltrated information.\n\n\n\nThe hacker’s post, Check Point says, relates to an incident that occurred in December 2024, after credentials for a portal account were compromised. The account had limited access and the intrusion was addressed immediately, the company says.\n\n\n\n“This event included 3 organizations’ tenants in a portal that does not include customers’ systems, production, or security architecture. The event did not include the description detailed in the post,” Check Point says.Advertisement.

Now, the company released the patches for iOS 16.7.11 and iPadOS 16.7.11, and iOS 15.8.4 and iPadOS 15.8.4 as well.\n\n\n\nThe updates also resolve CVE-2025-24200, a medium-severity authorization bug that could allow a physical attacker to disable USB Restricted Mode on a locked device, and which was fixed in February with the release of iOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1.\n\n\n\nApple says it received reports that both issues have been exploited in sophisticated attacks against specific users. The WebKit bug was exploited against iOS versions before 17.2.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the company rolled out new security updates for the latest generation mobile devices, resolving 60 vulnerabilities with iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, and 38 flaws with iPadOS 17.7.6.\n\n\n\nThe platform refresh includes patches for 60 issues that could lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, privilege escalation, information leak, sandbox escape, unauthorized access, preferences bypass, denial-of-service, memory corruption, user tracking, spoofing, and cross-site scripting attacks.\n\n\n\nmacOS Sequoia 15.4 was released on Monday to address over 130 bugs, macOS Sonoma 14.7.5 to patch over 90 flaws, and macOS Ventura 13.7.5 to fix roughly 85 security defects. Apple also announced the release of security updates for Safari, Xcode, tvOS, and visionOS.Advertisement.

The feature forces apps to obtain permission before collecting data to target users with personalized ads. While the feature was designed to tighten up privacy, it faced criticism from Big Tech rivals that it would make it harder for smaller apps to survive without charging consumers.\n\n\n\nThe fine, punishing Apple for abuse of its dominant position in mobile app distribution, covers the period from April 2021 to July 2023. But the amount is a pittance for the iPhone maker, which earned $124 billion in revenue in the final three months of last year.\n\n\n\nThe watchdog said the feature’s rollout resulted in users being barraged by pop-ups from third-party apps requesting their consent. It bemoaned how the proliferation of these consent windows made it “excessively complex” for app users to navigate the iOS environment.\n\n\n\nIt also questioned the system’s neutrality, saying it penalized the smallest publishers, which depend to a large extent on the collection of third-party data to finance their activity.\n\n\n\nApple said in a statement that ATT gives users more privacy control “through a required, clear, and easy-to-understand prompt about one thing: tracking.”Advertisement.
