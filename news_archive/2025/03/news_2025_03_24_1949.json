        "Content": "A set of five critical security shortcomings have been disclosed in the\nIngress NGINX Controller\nfor\nKubernetes\nthat could result in unauthenticated remote code execution, putting over 6,500 clusters at immediate risk by exposing the component to the public internet.\nThe vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-24513, CVE-2025-24514, CVE-2025-1097, CVE-2025-1098, and CVE-2025-1974 ), assigned a CVSS score of 9.8, have been collectively codenamed IngressNightmare by cloud security firm Wiz. It's worth noting that the shortcomings do not impact\nNGINX Ingress Controller\n, which is another ingress controller implementation for NGINX and NGINX Plus.\n\"Exploitation of these vulnerabilities leads to unauthorized access to all secrets stored across all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster by attackers, which can result in cluster takeover,\" the company said in a\nreport\nshared with The Hacker News.\nIngressNightmare, at its core, affects the\nadmission controller\ncomponent of the Ingress NGINX Controller for Kubernetes. About 43% of cloud environments are vulnerable to these vulnerabilities.\nIngress NGINX Controller uses NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer, making it possible to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside a cluster to services within it.\nThe vulnerability takes advantage of the fact that admission controllers, deployed within a Kubernetes pod, are accessible over the network without authentication.\nSpecifically, it involves injecting an arbitrary NGINX configuration remotely by sending a malicious ingress object (aka AdmissionReview requests) directly to the admission controller, resulting in code execution on the Ingress NGINX Controller's pod.\n\"The admission controller's elevated privileges and unrestricted network accessibility create a critical escalation path,\" Wiz explained. \"Exploiting this flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code and access all cluster secrets across namespaces, that could lead to complete cluster takeover.\"\nThe shortcomings are listed below -\nCVE-2025-24514\n– auth-url Annotation Injection\nCVE-2025-1097\n– auth-tls-match-cn Annotation Injection\nCVE-2025-1098\n– mirror UID Injection\nCVE-2025-1974\n– NGINX Configuration Code Execution\nIn an experimental attack scenario, a threat actor could upload a malicious payload in the form of a shared library to the pod by using the client-body buffer feature of NGINX, followed by sending an AdmissionReview request to the admission controller.\nThe request, in turn, contains one of the aforementioned configuration directive injections that causes the shared library to be loaded, effectively leading to remote code execution.\nHillai Ben-Sasson, cloud security researcher at Wiz, told The Hacker News that the attack chain essentially involves injecting malicious configuration, and utilizing it to read sensitive files and run arbitrary code. This could subsequently permit an attacker to abuse a strong Service Account in order to read Kubernetes secrets and ultimately facilitate cluster takeover.\nFollowing responsible disclosure, the vulnerabilities have been addressed in Ingress NGINX Controller versions 1.12.1, 1.11.5, and 1.10.7.\nUsers are recommended to update to the latest version as soon as possible and ensure that the\nadmission webhook endpoint\nis not exposed externally.\nAs mitigations, it's advised to limit only the Kubernetes API Server to access the admission controller and temporarily disable the admission controller component if it's not needed.\nFound this article interesting?

Affiliates keep 80% of the ransom payments, while the core operators earn 20%,\" Check Point\nsaid\nin a report published over the weekend./p>\n\"The only rule is not to target the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\"\nAs with any affiliate-backed ransomware program, VanHelsing claims to offer the ability to target a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, BSD, Arm, and ESXi. It also employs what's called the double extortion model of stealing data prior to encryption and threatening to leak the information unless the victim pays up.\nThe RaaS operators have also revealed that the scheme offers a control panel that works \"seamlessly\" on both desktop and mobile devices, with even support for dark mode.\nWhat makes VanHelsing notable is that it allows reputable affiliates to join for free, while new affiliates are required to pay a $5,000 deposit in order to gain access to the program.\nOnce launched, the C++-based ransomware takes steps to delete shadow copies, enumerate local and network drives, and encrypt files with the extension \".vanhelsing,\" after which the desktop wallpaper is modified, and a ransom note is dropped onto the victim system, urging them to make a Bitcoin payment.\nIt also supports various command-line arguments to dictate various aspects of the ransomware's behavior, such as the encryption mode to be used, the locations that need to be encrypted, spread the locker to SMB servers, and skip renaming the files with the ransomware extension in \"Silent\" mode.\nAccording to\nCYFIRMA\n, government, manufacturing, and pharmaceutical companies located in France and the United States have become the targets of the nascent ransomware operation.\n\"With a user-friendly control panel and frequent updates, VanHelsing is becoming a powerful tool for cybercriminals,\" Check Point said. Within just two weeks of its launch, it has already caused significant damage, infecting multiple victims and demanding hefty ransoms.\nThe emergence of VanHelsing coincides with a number of developments in the ever-evolving ransomware landscape -\nThe discovery of\nnew versions of Albabat ransomware\nthat go beyond Windows to Linux and macOS, gathering system and hardware information\nBlackLock\nransomware, a rebranded version of\nEldorado\n, has become one of the most active RaaS groups in 2025, targeting technology, manufacturing, construction, finance, and retail sectors\nBlackLock is\nactively recruiting\ntraffers\nto drive early stages of ransomware attacks, directing victims to malicious pages that deploy malware capable of establishing initial access to compromised systems\nThe JavaScript-based malware framework known as\nSocGholish\n(aka FakeUpdates) is being used to\ndeliver\nRansomHub\nransomware, an activity attributed to a threat cluster dubbed Water Scylla\nThe exploitation of security flaws in Fortinet firewall appliances (\nCVE-2024-55591\nand\nCVE-2025-24472\n) by a threat actor dubbed\nMora_001\nsince late January 2025 to deliver a newly discovered ransomware strain codenamed SuperBlack, a modified version of\nLockBit 3.0\nthat utilizes a custom data exfiltration tool\nThe Babuk2 (aka Babuk-Bjorka) ransomware group has been\nobserved\nreusing data from earlier breaches associated with RansomHub, FunkSec, LockBit, and Babuk to issue fake extortion demands to victims\nAccording to\nstatistics\ncompiled by Bitdefender, February 2025 was the worst month for ransomware in history, hitting a record 962 victims, up from 425 victims in February 2024.

        "Content": "A quiet tweak in a popular open-source tool opened the door to a supply chain breach—what started as a targeted attack quickly spiraled, exposing secrets across countless projects.\nThat wasn't the only stealth move. A new all-in-one malware is silently stealing passwords, crypto, and control—while hiding in plain sight. And over 300 Android apps joined the chaos, running ad fraud at scale behind innocent-looking icons.\nMeanwhile, ransomware gangs are getting smarter—using stolen drivers to shut down defenses—and threat groups are quietly shifting from activism to profit. Even browser extensions are changing hands, turning trusted tools into silent threats.\nAI is adding fuel to the fire—used by both attackers and defenders—while critical bugs, cloud loopholes, and privacy shakeups are keeping teams on edge.\nLet's dive into the threats making noise behind the scenes.\n⚡ Threat of the Week\nCoinbase the Initial Target of GitHub Action Supply Chain Breach\n— The supply chain compromise involving the GitHub Action \"tj-actions/changed-files\"\nstarted\nas a highly-targeted attack against one of Coinbase's open-source projects, before evolving into something more widespread and less stealthy. The attackers are suspected of attempting to poison open-source projects associated with Coinbase, failing which they mounted a large-scale campaign by pushing a malicious version of \"tj-actions/changed-files\" that leaked CI/CD secrets from any repository that ran the workflow. It's not clear what the end goal of the campaign was, but Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 told The Hacker News that it was likely financially motivated with an aim to conduct cryptocurrency theft.\nThe State of GRC 2025: From Cost Center to Strategic Business Driver\nDrata's new report takes a look at how GRC professionals are approaching data protection regulations, AI, and the ability to maintain customer trust.\nDownload the Report ➝\n🔔 Top News\nStilachiRAT is a Swiss Army knife of RATs\n— A stealthy remote access trojan (RAT) called\nStilachiRAT\nillustrates how threat actors are bundling a wide array of malicious capabilities into a single tool. The RAT is a Swiss Army knife for hackers, incorporating features for extensive system reconnaissance, data gathering, cryptocurrency theft, and credential theft with mechanisms to evade detection and maintain persistence on compromised systems. It also delays connection to an external server to fly under the radar. Microsoft said it first detected the malware in November 2024 in limited attacks, but the exact delivery mechanism remains unclear.\nOver 300 Android Apps Behind Ad Fraud Campaign\n— A large-scale ad fraud campaign has resulted in more than 60 million downloads of malicious apps from the Google Play Store. As many as 331 apps have been discovered as part of the active campaign codenamed\nVapor\n. These apps display out-of-context ads and attempt to steal credentials from online services. Google has since removed the apps from the Google Play Store, but they may be still available for download from unofficial third-party app marketplaces.\nMedusa Ransomware Uses ABYSSWORKER to Blind EDR Software\n— The threat actors behind the Medusa ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation have been observed using a malicious driver dubbed\nABYSSWORKER\nas part of a bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) attack designed to terminate anti-malware tools. The driver samples are signed using likely stolen, revoked certificates from Chinese companies, allowing it to sidestep security defenses. The development comes as cybercriminals are\nabusing\nMicrosoft's\nTrusted Signing platform\nto sign malware executables with short-lived three-day certificates.\nHead Mare and Twelve Likely Collaborating to Target Russia\n— Two known hacktivist groups codenamed Head Mare and Twelve are\nlikely working together\nto target Russian entities. The links are based on Head Mare's use of tools previously associated with Twelve, as well as command-and-control (C2) servers exclusively employed by Twelve prior to these incidents. The attacks culminated in the deployment of LockBit for Windows and Babuk for Linux (ESXi) in exchange for a ransom.\nAquatic Panda Attributed to 2022 Espionage Campaign\n— The China-aligned Aquatic Panda has been linked to a \"global espionage campaign\" that took place in 2022 targeting seven organizations in Taiwan, Hungary, Turkey, Thailand, France, and the United States. The attacks that took place between January and October 2022 have been codenamed Operation FishMedley. The intrusion set made use of an as-yet-unknown initial access vector to deploy malware families such as ShadowPad, Spyder, SodaMaster, and a previously undocumented C++ implant called RPipeCommander.\n‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs\nAttackers love software vulnerabilities—they're easy doors into your systems. Every week brings fresh flaws, and waiting too long to patch can turn a minor oversight into a major breach. Below are this week's critical vulnerabilities you need to know about. Take a look, update your software promptly, and keep attackers locked out.\nThis week's list includes —\nCVE-2025-29927\n(Next.js),\nCVE-2025-23120\n(Veeam Backup & Replication),\nCVE-2024-56346, CVE-2024-56347\n(IBM Advanced Interactive eXecutive),\nCVE-2024-10441\n(Synology BeeStation Manager, DiskStation Manager, and Unified Controller),\nCVE-2025-26909\n(WP Ghost),\nCVE-2023-43650, CVE-2023-43651, CVE-2023-43652, CVE-2023-42818, CVE-2023-46123, CVE-2024-29201, CVE-2024-29202, CVE-2024-40628, CVE-2024-40629\n(JumpServer), and\nCVE-2025-0927\n(Linux kernel)\n📰 Around the Cyber World\nGoogle Releases OSV-Scanner 2\n— Google has\nannounced\nthe release of an updated iteration of OSV-Scanner, its free vulnerability scanner for open-source developers. \"This V2 release builds upon the foundation we laid with\nOSV-SCALIBR\nand adds significant new capabilities to OSV-Scanner, making it a comprehensive vulnerability scanner and remediation tool with broad support for formats and ecosystems,\" Google said. OSV-SCALIBR, an open-source Go library, was released by Google earlier this January.\nNorth Korea Sets Up New Hacking Group\n— The North Korean government is reportedly setting up a new hacking group within the intelligence agency Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). According to\nDailyNK\n, the new unit, called Research Center 227, will focus on research to develop \"offensive hacking technologies and programs.\" It's also said to research Western cybersecurity systems and computer networks, bolster Pyongyang's capabilities to steal digital assets, and develop AI-based techniques for information theft. Over the past couple of years, North Korean hackers have become adept at siphoning funds from cryptocurrency exchanges and companies around the world, like the recent\n$1.4 billion-worth hack of Bybit\n. \"The Bybit attack demonstrated a sophisticated, multi-stage approach which ultimately allowed the threat actor to take control of Bybit's cold wallet and siphon funds,\" Sygnia\nsaid\nin a post-mortem report of the incident. \"During the attack, the threat actor showed a sophisticated ability to overcome security challenges across multiple domains, including macOS malwares, AWS cloud compromise, application security and smart contract security.\" The incident is said to have first infected a macOS workstation belonging to a Safe{Wallet} developer on February 4, 2025, using their AWS access token to access Safe{Wallet}'s AWS infrastructure and injected malicious JavaScript on the platform's web interface. \"The malicious code included an activation condition, set to execute the transaction manipulation only on a specific Bybit's cold wallet,\" Sygnia added. \"Bybit initiated a transaction from the targeted cold wallet using Safe{Wallet}'s web interface. The transaction was manipulated, and the attackers siphoned the funds from the cold wallets.\" The malicious JavaScript code was removed two minutes after the transaction went through. In the meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange OKX has\ntemporarily suspended\nits DEX aggregator services misused by the North Korean hackers to launder stolen funds. The threat actors are\nestimated\nto have already successfully converted at least $300 million of the stolen assets to unrecoverable funds.\nCloudflare Blocks Unencrypted Traffic to its API Endpoints; Debuts AI Labyrinth\n— Cloudflare has announced that it's closing all HTTP ports on api.cloudflare.com so as to enforce the use of HTTPS so as to secure Cloudflare API traffic. \"Connections made over cleartext HTTP ports risk exposing sensitive information because the data is transmitted unencrypted and can be intercepted by network intermediaries, such as ISPs, Wi-Fi hotspot providers, or malicious actors on the same network,\" it\nnoted\n. \"It's common for servers to either redirect or return a 403 (Forbidden) response to close the HTTP connection and enforce the use of HTTPS by clients. However, by the time this occurs, it may be too late, because sensitive information, such as an API token, may have already been transmitted in cleartext in the initial client request.\" Furthermore, third-parties on shared networks could intercept sensitive data from the plaintext HTTP request, or even carry out a Monster-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by impersonating the web server. The company said it intends to introduce the ability for customers to opt-in to disable all HTTP port traffic for their websites on Cloudflare. The security feature is expected to be made available for free in the last quarter of 2025. The web infrastructure provider has also announced a new feature called AI Labyrinth that aims to combat unauthorized AI data scraping by serving fake AI-generated decoy content when \"inappropriate bot behavior\" is detected. \"When we detect unauthorized crawling, rather than blocking the request, we will link to a series of AI-generated pages that are convincing enough to entice a crawler to traverse them,\" Cloudflare\nsaid\n. \"But while real looking, this content is not actually the content of the site we are protecting, so the crawler wastes time and resources.\"\nEuropol Warns off AI Reshaping Organized Crime\n— Europol has\nwarned\nthat artificial intelligence (AI) is turbocharging organized crime gangs' ability to pull off scams and expand their operations globally. The technology allows them to create multi-lingual messages, impersonate individuals, conduct more sophisticated cyber fraud, and generate manipulated or synthetic imagery. Identifying ransomware, data theft, and disinformation as most acute hybrid cybercrime threats, the European police organization said that criminal groups are using cryptocurrency to launder money and move funds around, making their activities harder to detect. \"The emergence of fully autonomous AI could pave the way for entirely AI-controlled criminal networks, marking a new era in organized crime,\" Europol said.\nU.K. NCSC Releases Guidance For Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Migration\n— The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre has\nreleased\na three-phase timeline to help organizations transition to quantum-resistant encryption by 2035. The advice emphasizes the adoption of post-quantum cryptography to protect sensitive data, such as banking and communications, from future risks posed by quantum computers. To that end, organizations are expected to identify cryptographic services needing upgrades and build a migration plan by 2028, execute high-priority upgrades and refine plans as PQC evolves from 2028 to 2031, and complete migration to PQC for all systems, services and products from 2031 to 2035.\nNew Campaign Targets Misconfigured Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) Servers for Crypto Mining\n— Misconfigured and vulnerable Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) servers have been targeted by unknown threat actors to deliver cryptocurrency miners capable of mining PKT Classic and Monero. \"The attackers utilized the certutil utility, a legitimate Windows tool (also known as a LOLBin), to download PKT mining tool,\" QuickHeal\nsaid\n. The attackers have also been observed launching cmd.exe to execute PowerShell commands that are responsible for downloading the XMRig mining software.\n3.2 Billion Credentials Compromised in 2024\n— Information stealers were used to steal 2.1 billion credentials last year, accounting for nearly two-thirds of 3.2 billion credentials stolen from all organizations, according to a report from Flashpoint. The most prolific stealer malware families observed included RedLine, RisePRO, StealC, Lumma, and Meta Stealer. \"This stolen data dominates illicit marketplaces and is used to fuel a number of illegal campaigns such as ransomware or other types of malware,\" the company\nsaid\n. Over 200 million credentials have already been stolen since the start of 2025. Information stealer infections were detected on 23 million hosts during the time period, with a majority of the systems running Microsoft Windows. The development comes as GitGuardian\nrevealed\nthat it detected 23,770,171 hard-coded secrets in public GitHub commits in 2024, up from 19.1 million in 2023, even as 70% of the secrets leaked in 2022 continue to remain valid, posing a lucrative attack surface.\nTelegram CEO Leaving France Amid Criminal Probe\n— French authorities have allowed Pavel Durov, Telegram's CEO and founder, to temporarily leave the country as they continue to investigate criminal activity on the messaging platform. \"As you may have heard, I've returned to Dubai after spending several months in France due to an investigation related to the activity of criminals on Telegram. The process is ongoing, but it feels great to be home,\" Durov\nsaid\nin a post on Telegram. He was\noriginally arrested\nin August 2024 in connection with a probe into the abuse of Telegram for fraud, drug trafficking, and illegal content distribution. Last week, the messaging service\nsurpassed\n1 billion monthly active users.\n7,966 New Flaws Uncovered in the WordPress Ecosystem in 2024\n— As many as 7,966 new vulnerabilities impacting the WordPress ecosystem were discovered in 2024, with 7,633 defects affecting plugins, and 326 affecting themes. The number represents a 34% increase over 2023. \"While the majority of vulnerabilities don't pose an active risk, high priority vulnerabilities were also up 11% year on year,\" Patchstack\nsaid\n. \"Only seven vulnerabilities were uncovered in WordPress core itself, but none of those were significant enough to pose a widespread threat.\"\nApple Discloses Passwords App Bug\n— Apple fixed a bug in the iOS 18.2 Passwords app that could have allowed a user with a privileged network position to leak credentials. The flaw, tracked as\nCVE-2024-44276\n, was addressed by using HTTPS when sending information over the network. Security researchers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk of Mysk Inc, who have been credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerability,\nsaid\nthe Passwords app was sending unencrypted HTTP requests for the logos and icons it displays next to the sites associated with the stored passwords, as well as the links for changing easily guessable passwords. This also means that an attacker on the same network could intercept the password reset links and redirect victims to a bogus phishing site.\nWhat Happens When a Browser Extension Changes Hands?\n— Secure Annex has warned of the serious privacy and security risks resulting from web browser extensions changing ownership after they are listed for sale on extension marketplaces. \"While original developers typically prioritize user interests, new owners may exploit valuable permissions to access everything from browsing patterns to authentication credentials,\" John Tuckner\nsaid\n. \"The danger lies in how seamlessly these changes occur—users receive no notification when an extension changes hands, and unless new permissions are required, the transition is invisible.\" In the case of Google Chrome add-ons, registered developers are required to submit a request to Google, which then takes about a week to approve the transfer after verifying with the developer that the extension transfer was indeed requested. That said, once the transfer is complete, the new owner has complete control of the extension and could push code updates to the user base. \"The new version I released did seem to go through a review process before being published, but it is very unclear to what degree of scrutiny,\" Tuckner added.\nSignal Threatens to Leave France Over \"Narcotrafic\" Law\n— Privacy-focused messaging app Signal said it would leave France if proposed amendments to\nNarcotrafic law\nare enacted. The changes would compel providers of encrypted communication services to implement backdoors, enabling law enforcement authorities to access decrypted messages of suspected criminals within 72 hours of a request. \"End to end encryption must only have two 'ends' -- sender and recipient(s). Otherwise, it is backdoored,\" Signal President Meredith Whittaker\nsaid\n. \"Whatever method is devised to add a 'third end' —- from a perverted PRNG in a cryptographic protocol to vendor-provided government software grafted onto the side of secure communications that allow said government to add themselves to your chats — it rips a hole in the hull of private communications and is a backdoor.\" Similar backdoor demands have also been made by\nSweden\nand\nthe U.K.\n, prompting Apple to disable the Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for iCloud for U.K. citizens. \"The U.K.'s demand of Apple raises a number of serious concerns which directly impact national security and therefore warrant robust public debate,\" according to a\njoint letter\npublished by Senators Ron Wyden and Alex Padilla, along with Representatives Andy Biggs, Warren Davidson, and Zoe Lofgren. Google, for its part, has refused to deny if it has received a similar technical capabilities notice, something it would be prohibited from publicly disclosing even if that were the case.\nSecurity Considerations With Azure App Proxy\n— New research has found that Microsoft\nAzure app proxy\npre-authentication set to Passthrough may unintentionally expose private network resources. App proxy is a feature that allows for publishing on-premises applications to the public without opening ports on a firewall, allowing secure remote access via Entra ID for authentication. While Entra ID is the default option for pre-authentication, setting it to\nPassthrough\nmeans there are no protections restricting access from the Azure app proxy side. \"Passthrough pre-authentication is basically the equivalent of opening a port on your firewall to the private system,\" TRUSTEDSEC\nsaid\n.\nAmazon to Send Alexa Voice Requests to Cloud Starting March 28\n— Amazon is getting rid of a privacy feature that allows users of its Echo smart speaker to prevent their voice commands from going to the company's cloud and instead be\nprocessed locally on-device\n. Starting March 28, 2025, the option \"Do Not Send Voice Recordings\" will no longer be available, with the company stating it made the decision in light of new generative artificial intelligence features that rely on being processed in the cloud. That said, users still have the option to prevent Alexa from saving voice recordings.\nDragonForce Transitions to a Ransomware Group\n—\nDragonForce\n, originally known for its pro-Palestinian hacktivist activities, has now transitioned into a financially motivated ransomware group. Their operations have expanded beyond ideological motives to include sophisticated ransomware attacks targeting global organizations. \"The group uses a structured extortion model that features a Dark Web leak site to publicly showcase victim data, ransom negotiations, and countdown timers. This strategy increases pressure on victims to meet their demands,\" researchers\nsaid\n. DragonForce's ransomware is based on the LockBit builder from 2022, utilizing similar configurations and attack strategies. Notably, the ransomware includes its icon and wallpaper within the binary's overlay, which is compressed using Zlib and loaded dynamically during execution. This approach improves stealth and helps to evade static detection methods.\nSecurity Flaw in dirk1983/chatgpt Comes Under Exploitation\n— A medium-severity\nsecurity flaw\nimpacting dirk1983/chatgpt has come under active exploitation in the wild. The security vulnerability in question is\nCVE-2024-27564\n(CVSS score: 6.5), a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the pictureproxy.php component that could allow an attacker to force the application to make arbitrary requests via crafted URLs in the url parameter. Cybersecurity company Veriti\nsaid\nit observed over 10,479 attack attempts from a single malicious IP address, with financial institutions and U.S. government entities emerging as the top target of the activity. Financial and healthcare firms in Germany, Thailand, Indonesia, Colombia, and the U.K. have been targeted as well.\nHow Adversaries Could Abuse AWS SNS Service\n— Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Notification Service (\nSNS\n) is a web service that allows users to send and receive notifications from the cloud. Last year, SentinelOne disclosed how threat actors are\nweaponizing SNS\nto send bulk smishing messages. According to\nlatest analysis\nfrom Elastic Security Labs, the service could also be leveraged as a data exfiltration channel to bypass traditional data protection mechanisms such as network access control lists (ACLs). While this approach poses some challenges of its own – specifically when it comes to executing a script or running commands without triggering alarms (e.g., CloudTrail) – it offers a way to blend in with native AWS services and leaves minimal footprint.\n🎥 Expert Webinar\nAI Is Fueling Attacks—Learn How to Shut Them Down\n— AI isn't the future threat—it's today's biggest challenge. From deepfake phishing to AI-powered reconnaissance, attackers are moving faster than legacy defenses can keep up. In this session, Zscaler's Diana Shtil shares practical ways to use Zero Trust to defend against AI-driven threats—before they reach your perimeter.\nForget Detection—Here's How to Eliminate Identity-Based Attacks\n— Phishing, MFA bypass, and device risks are still winning—even after years of tool sprawl and training. Why? Because most defenses assume some attacks will succeed. This session flips that mindset. Join us to explore secure-by-design access that prevents breaches altogether. Learn how to block phishing, enforce device compliance (even on unmanaged endpoints), and apply continuous, risk-based access—before attackers even get a chance.\nAI Tools Are Bypassing Your Controls—Here's How to Find and Stop Them\n— You can't protect what you can't see. Shadow AI tools are quietly spreading across SaaS environments—often unnoticed until it's too late. Join Reco's Dvir Sasson for a real-world look at hidden AI usage, stealthy attack paths, and how to get visibility before threats become incidents.\n🔧 Cybersecurity Tools\nT-Pot Honeypot Platform\n—Looking to catch attackers before they cause damage? T-Pot is a powerful, all-in-one honeypot platform that bundles 20+ honeypots with built-in dashboards, live attack maps, and threat analysis tools—no commercial license needed. Whether you're running a home lab or defending a small enterprise, T-Pot helps you simulate vulnerable services to detect real-world attacks in real-time. It runs on Docker, supports both ARM and x86, and even works in cloud or virtual machines. Ideal for learning, testing, or setting traps for bad actors—just don't forget to isolate it properly from production systems.\nRogue\n— It's an advanced AI-driven security tool that acts like a smart penetration tester—using large language models (OpenAI & Claude) to think through web app behavior, craft tailored attack payloads, and verify vulnerabilities with minimal false positives. Unlike traditional scanners, Rogue analyzes each target in real-time, adapting its tests based on responses and generating detailed, easy-to-read reports. With built-in subdomain discovery, traffic monitoring, and flexible CLI options, it's a powerful free tool for security researchers and red teamers looking to automate smarter, context-aware testing.\n🔒 Tip of the Week\nAudit Your Active Directory in Minutes\n— If you manage or work with Active Directory (AD), don't assume it's secure by default. Many AD environments quietly collect risky settings—like unused admin accounts, weak password rules, or overly broad group permissions—that attackers love to exploit.\nTo find and fix these, try free tools like\nInvokeADCheck\n(great for quick AD health scans),\nPingCastle\n(for visual risk scoring and reports), and\nBloodHound Community Edition\n(to map attack paths across users and permissions). Even basic steps—like identifying inactive accounts, reviewing GPOs, or checking who's a Domain Admin—can uncover big risks. Run these tools in a test-safe environment and start building a checklist of things to clean up. You don't need a full red team to tighten your AD—just the right tools and a bit of time.\nConclusion\nThis week's stories weren't just headlines—they were warning shots. The tools we trust, the systems we rely on, and even the apps we barely notice are all part of the modern attack surface.\nCybersecurity isn't just about blocking threats—it's about understanding how fast the rules are changing. From code to cloud, from RATs to regulations, the landscape keeps shifting under our feet.\nStay curious, stay sharp, and don't underestimate the small stuff—it's often where the big breaches begin.\nUntil next week, patch smart and think like an attacker.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "If given the choice, most users are likely to favor a seamless experience over complex security measures, as they don't prioritize strong password security. However, balancing security and usability doesn't have to be a zero-sum game. By implementing the right best practices and tools, you can strike a balance between robust password security and a frictionless user experience (UX).\nThis article explores how to achieve the perfect balance between strong password security and a seamless user experience, even as the standards for strong passwords continue to evolve.\nWhy user friction is bad for cybersecurity\nEnd users that find security measures cumbersome or frustrating might disregard them, resulting in unintentional cyber risk exposures. These scenarios are especially pronounced in the workplace; if cybersecurity protocols (e.g., strong password security policies) are perceived as obstacles to productivity, employees will frequently ignore or circumvent them due to how difficult, time-consuming, or frustrating a workflow is for users to complete.\nHigh levels of user friction can therefore directly contribute to security risks. For example,\n71% of professionals\nadmit to engaging in risky cybersecurity behaviors, such as\nreusing or sharing passwords\n. When security measures create unnecessary friction, users are more likely to bypass them, ultimately resulting in weakened password security and increased exposure to cyber threats.\nEnhancing UX for better security\nAlthough high user friction can negatively impact cybersecurity, the opposite is also true: a well-optimized UX naturally enhances security. Users faced with security measures that are intuitive, seamless, and minimally disruptive are more likely to follow best practices and comply with security policies.\nReal-time password strength feedback enhances both security and user experience by guiding users toward stronger, more secure passwords without frustration, thanks to\nSpecops Password Policy\nMethods to improve both password security and user experience\nSecurity teams can prioritize usability in their processes and protocols by implementing the following methods:\nReducing password complexity\nIn the past, a common approach to strong password security was selecting a sufficiently complex array of words and characters to ensure uniqueness. However, in practice this has led to password convergence; that is, users recycling the same patterns to cope with complexity requirements. Security teams should implement password policies that\nfocus on length over complexity\n.\nUsing passphrases vs. passwords\nBy using passphrases over passwords, users can comply with long password requirements (e.g., 15 characters and above) while at the same time improving recallability. For example, a passphrase that joins three or more random words like \"Mustache-Breadcrumb-Headspin\" is a lot easier to remember than a random sequence of letters and numbers.\nUsers can start by joining three or more random words, followed by swapping out some characters and introducing intentional misspellings. This allows for an additional bolstering of password strength without introducing significant memorization overhead.\nYou can find a full guide on moving to passphrases here\n.\nSpecops Password Policy\n: Enforcing passphrase rules to increase entropy and enhance security without compromising usability\nProviding dynamic feedback during password creation\nA key principle of usability and UX design is the reduction of interaction costs. As defined by leading UX design firm Nielsen Norman Group,\ninteraction cost\nis the sum of mental and physical efforts that users must exert to reach a specific goal. Users appreciate immediate feedback related to a potential password's efficacy and whether or not it aligns with policy. By providing users with\ndynamic password feedback\nduring password creation, you can reduce the interaction cost of strong password security by making the process interactive and streamlined.\nHandling forced password resets gracefully\nWhen security incidents like data breaches or compromises occur, firms may have no choice but to implement organization-wide password resets. Security teams can enforce password resets gracefully with solutions like\nSpecops Password Policy\n—these tools smooth the friction by providing dynamic feedback to users during the forced password reset process, as well as options for traditional passwords, longer and more secure passphrases, or both.\nAging passwords based on length\nPasswords that\nnever expire\nare security compromises waiting to happen. As a result, today's users —though often reluctantly—accept that they will need to change their passwords at some point. Security teams can make this experience as painless as possible by providing users an option for length-based aging. By allowing for either shorter/weaker passwords with a reduced shelf life or longer/stronger passwords with an extended lifespan, security teams can strike a balance between\nrobust security and UX\n.\nRoll out passphrases using a password policy\nSecurity teams that\nroll out new password policies\nare better positioned to preserve UX while maintaining a strong password security posture. Solutions like\nSpecops Password Policy\nsimplify the management of fine-grained password policies while ensuring that compromised credentials and weak passwords are blocked or handled appropriately.\nFind the balance between password security and UX\nIn short, strong security measures shouldn't come at the cost of frustrating users, nor should convenience lead to weak cyber defenses. Striking the right balance between strong password security and an optimal UX is crucial for long-term resilience.\nSpeak to an expert\ntoday and find out how Specops Password Policy enables effective and user-friendly password security.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A China-linked advanced threat group named Weaver Ant spent more than four years in the network of a telecommunications services provider, hiding traffic and infrastructure with the help of compromised Zyxel CPE routers.\nResearchers investigating the intrusion found multiple variants of the China Chopper backdoor and a previously undocumented custom web-shell called ‘INMemory’ that executes payloads in the host’s memory.\nThe threat actor targeted a major Asian telecommunications provider and proved to be resilient to multiple eradication attempts, according to the researchers at cyber technology and services company Sygnia.\n“Weaving” a network within the network\nWeaver Ant intrusions leveraged an operational relay box (ORB) network made primarily of Zyxel CPE routers to proxy traffic and conceal infrastructure.\nThe threat actor established a foothold on the network by using an AES-encrypted variant of the China Chopper web shell, which allowed remote control of servers while bypassing firewall restrictions.\nAs the operation matured, Weaver Ant introduced a more advanced, custom-build web shell known as INMemory, which leverages a DLL (eval.dll) for stealthy ‘just-in-time code execution.’\nThe INMemory web-shell\nSource: Sygnia\nThe data exfiltration methods used in the attacks were also selected to raise as little alarm as possible, including passive network traffic capturing via port mirroring, Sygnia researchers say in a\nreport\ntoday.\nInstead of deploying web shells in isolation, Weaver Ant linked them together in a technique called ‘web shell tunneling,’ previously pioneered by the financially-motivated threat actor ‘\nElephant Beetle\n.’\nThis technique routes traffic from one server to the next across distinct network segments, essentially creating a covert command-and-control (C2) network inside the victim’s infrastructure.\nEach shell acts as a proxy, passing nested and encrypted payloads to others for staged execution deeper inside the network.\n“Web shell tunneling is a method that leverages multiple web shells as ‘proxy servers’ to redirect inbound HTTP traffic to another web shell on a different host for payload execution,” explains Sygnia in the technical report.\nBecause of this, Weaver Ant could \"operate on servers within different network segments.\" These were mainly internal servers with no internet connection and accessed through servers reachable over the web that acted as operational gateways.\nWeb-shell tunneling\nSource: Sygnia\nSygnia’s findings show that Weaver Ant moved laterally using SMB shares and high-privileged accounts that had the same password for years, often authenticated via NTLM hashes.\nThe data they collected over more than four years of access to the victim's network includes configuration files, access logs, and credential data to map out the environment and target valuable systems.\nThey also disabled logging mechanisms like ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) patching and AMSI bypasses (overwriting the ‘AmsiScanBuffer’ function in the ‘amsi.dll’ module) to keep a smaller footprint and remain undetected for a longer time.\nWeb-shell deployment chain\nSource: Sygnia\nWeaver Ant proves to be a skilled state-sponsored actor capable to achieve long-term access on the victim network for cyber espionage operations.\nSygnia says that its attribution is based on the use of Zyxel router models that are popular within specific geographic regions, the use of backdoors previously linked to Chinese threat groups, and the operation of Weaver Ant during GMT +8 business hours.\nThe threat actor appears to be more focused on network intelligence, credential harvesting, and continuous access to telecom infrastructure rather than stealing user data or financial records, which is consistent with state-sponsored espionage goals.\nTo defend against this advanced threat, it is recommended to apply internal network traffic controls, enable full IIS and PowerShell logging, apply least privilege principles, and rotate user credentials frequently.\nAlso, the reuse of known web shells gives defenders an opportunity to catch malicious activity early using static detection tools and known signatures.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nChinese cyberspies backdoor Juniper routers for stealthy access\nSilk Typhoon hackers now target IT supply chains to breach networks\nChinese hackers use custom malware to spy on US telecom networks\nChinese espionage tools deployed in RA World ransomware attack\nNew NailaoLocker ransomware used against EU healthcare orgs"

        "Content": "African law enforcement authorities have arrested 306 suspects as part of 'Operation Red Card,' an INTERPOL-led international crackdown targeting cross-border cybercriminal networks.\nBetween November 2024 and February 2025, authorities seized 1,842 devices allegedly used in mobile banking, investment, and messaging app scams linked to over 5,000 victims.\n\"Ahead of the operation, countries exchanged criminal intelligence on key targets. This intelligence was enriched by INTERPOL with insights into criminal modus operandi using data from its private sector partners—Group-IB, Kaspersky and Trend Micro,\" the international police organization said.\n\"The seven participating countries were Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Togo and Zambia.\"\nNigerian police recently detained 130 individuals (including 113 foreign nationals) linked to investment fraud and online casino scams. They concealed their illicit earnings in digital assets and were recruited from various countries, operating in multiple languages. Some workers in these scam centers may also be human trafficking victims.\nZambian police also apprehended 14 suspects, part of a cybercrime gang that was allegedly hacking into victims' phones via malicious links that installed malware. This allowed them to control messaging accounts and access banking apps, spreading scams through victims' messaging apps.\nIn South Africa, police officers arrested 40 individuals and confiscated over 53 computers and over 1,000 SIM cards used in a SIM box fraud operation that rerouted international calls as local ones, facilitating large-scale SMS phishing attacks.\nRwandan authorities also detained another 45 individuals linked to a network involved in social engineering scams, who defrauded victims of over USD 305,000 in 2024. Their strategies included impersonating telecom staff and pretending to be injured relatives seeking financial help.\n\"The success of Operation Red Card demonstrates the power of international cooperation in combating cybercrime, which knows no borders and can have devastating effects on individuals and communities,\" said Neal Jetton, INTERPOL's Director of the Cybercrime Directorate.\n\"The recovery of significant assets and devices, as well as the arrest of key suspects, sends a strong message to cybercriminals that their activities will not go unpunished.\"\nThis is the latest INTERPOL-led operation targeting cybercrime in Africa in recent years, with multi-million operations either disrupted or dismantled after previous joint actions.\nBetween September 2nd and October 31st, another law enforcement action coordinated by Interpol and\ndubbed 'Operation Serengeti\n' led to the arrest of 1,006 suspects believed to be part of cybercrime links behind ransomware, digital extortion, business email compromise (BEC), and online scams.\nAs part of '\nOperation Africa Cyber Surge II\n,' launched in April 2023, law enforcement agencies from 25 African countries also disrupted over 20,000 cybercrime networks involved in extortion, phishing, BEC, and online scams, responsible for losses of over $40,000,000.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMalware campaign 'DollyWay' breached 20,000 WordPress sites\nUS govt says Americans lost record $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024\nAmericans lost record $10 billion to fraud in 2023, FTC warns\nGoogle expands Android AI scam detection to more Pixel devices\nDarcula PhaaS can now auto-generate phishing kits for any brand"

        "Content": "A critical severity vulnerability has been discovered in the Next.js open-source web development framework, potentially allowing attackers to bypass authorization checks.\nThe flaw, tracked as\nCVE-2025-29927\n, enables attackers to send requests that reach destination paths without going through critical security checks.\nNext.js is a popular React framework with more than 9 million weekly downloads\non npm\n. It is used for building full-stack web apps and includes middleware components for authentication and authorization.\nFront-end and full-stack developers use it to build web apps with React. Some of the more notable companies using it for their sites/apps are TikTok, Twitch, Hulu, Netflix, Uber, and Nike.\nAuthorization bypass\nIn Next.js, middleware components run before a request hits an application routing system and serve purposes like authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, redirecting users, applying geo-blocking or rate limits.\nTo prevent infinite loops where middleware re-triggers itself, Next.js uses a header called 'x-middleware-subrequest' that dictates if middleware functions should be applied or not.\nThe header is retrieved by the 'runMiddleware' function responsible for processing incoming requests. If it detects the 'x-middleware-subrequest' header, with a specific value, the entire middleware execution chain is bypassed and the request is forwarded to its destination.\nAn attacker can manually send a request that includes the header with a correct value and thus bypass protection mechanisms.\nAccording to researchers\nAllam Rachid\nand Allam Yasser (inzo_), who discovered the vulnerability and published a\ntechnical write-up\n, \"the header and its value act as a universal key allowing rules to be overridden.\"\nThe vulnerability impacts all Next.js versions before 15.2.3, 14.2.25, 13.5.9. and 12.3.5. Users are recommended to upgrade to newer revisions as soon as possible, since technical details for exploiting the security issue are public.\nNext.js'\nsecurity bulletin\nclarifies that CVE-2025-29927 impacts only self-hosted versions that use 'next start' with 'output: standalone'. Next.js apps apps hosted on Vercel and Nerlify, or deployed as static exports, are not affected.\nAlso affected are environments where middleware is used for authorization or security checks and there is no validation later in the application.\nIf patching is not possible at the time, the recommendation is to block external user requests that include the 'x-middleware-subrequest header'.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nGitLab patches critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities\nPalo Alto Networks tags new firewall bug as exploited in attacks\nJuniper patches critical auth bypass in Session Smart routers\nHackers exploit authentication bypass in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS\nSonicWall firewall exploit lets hackers hijack VPN sessions, patch now"

        "Date": "2025-03-24",
        "Content": "As businesses continue to migrate their operations to the cloud, maintaining and managing the security of these environments has become mission-critical. Microsoft 365 is a widely adopted suite of productivity tools, but relying solely on its built-in security features may leave organizations vulnerable to significant risks.\nThe Acronis Threat Research Unit recently conducted a quantitative study to explore the core security landscape of Microsoft 365 , and the findings are both alarming and instructive.\nThe Research Project\nThe Acronis Threat Research Unit assessed the security of Microsoft 365 email and application backup data. The study focused on Microsoft 365 seats that were configured to rely solely on the security settings provided by Microsoft, without the use of any additional third-party security solutions, including those offered by Acronis.\nTo ensure a broad and representative sample, the research team randomly selected data sets from more than 300,000 M365 seats from a pool of 1.2 million.\nThe Findings\nThe results of the study were both revealing and concerning. The Acronis Threat Research Unit detected a staggering number of malicious and suspicious elements within the backup data:\nMore than 2 million malicious or suspicious URLs: These URLs could lead to phishing sites, malware downloads, or other cyber threats.\nMore than 5,000 instances of actual malware: This includes a variety of malicious software designed to compromise systems, steal data, or disrupt operations.\nThe fact that these protocols identified such a high number of risks indicates that the basic security measures included with M365 are insufficient to protect against the current threat landscape.\nThe Shared Responsibility Model\nMicrosoft operates on a \"shared responsibility\" model when it comes to\nM365 secuirty and data protection\n. This model means that while Microsoft is responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure, the security of the data and applications within that infrastructure is the responsibility of the organization using the service.\nThis division of responsibility is crucial to understand, as it highlights the need for organizations to take proactive steps to secure their data.\nThe statistical data analysis conducted by the Acronis Threat Research Unit clearly demonstrates that the basic security protocols included in M365 are not sufficient to mitigate the level of threats present in today's digital environment. Relying solely on these basic security measures can allow risks to not only evade detection but also to persist in backups, creating a long-term threat to cloud systems and endpoint devices.\nThe Risks of Inadequate Security\nThe persistence of threats in backups is a particularly concerning issue. When malware or malicious URLs are not detected and removed, they can be restored along with legitimate data, re-infecting systems and causing further damage.\nThis persistence can lead to a cycle of recurring security incidents, undermining the integrity and reliability of the organization's data and systems.\nRecommendations for MSPs and IT Teams\nTo ensure business resilience and continuity, the Acronis Threat Research Unit strongly recommends that Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and IT teams within organizations adopt a full spectrum of security and data protection solutions. This includes:\nComprehensive Backup Solutions\n— Using robust backup solutions that include advanced security features can help ensure that backups are free from malware and other risks for both email and collaboration apps. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of data and systems in the event of a security incident.\nAdvanced Email Security\n— Implementing advanced email security solutions can help detect and block malicious emails, phishing attempts, and other email-based threats before they reach users' inboxes.\nCollaboration App Security\n— Ensuring that collaboration apps, such as Teams and SharePoint, are protected against malware and other threats is essential. Advanced security protocols can help identify and mitigate risks in real-time.\nRegular Security Audits\n— Conducting regular security audits and vulnerability assessments can help identify and address potential weaknesses in the organization's security posture.\nSecurity Awaeness Training\n— Educating employees about the latest security threats and best practices can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks. Regular training sessions and phishing simulations can help employees recognize and respond to threats effectively.\nConclusion\nThe findings of the Acronis Threat Research Unit underscore the importance of a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. While Microsoft 365 provides a solid foundation, it is not a comprehensive solution on its own. By leveraging advanced security and data protection solutions, organizations can significantly enhance their defenses and protect against the evolving threats that lurk below the surface.\nThe Acronis Threat Research Unit remains committed to ongoing research and innovation to help organizations stay one step ahead of cyber threats and ensure the security and resilience of their digital environments.\nFor more information about Acronis 7-in-One comprehensive solutions for M365, access our\ndedicated resources page\n.\nFor more information on the Acronis Threat Research Unit or to follow the latest alerts and updates, access the\nresearch blog here\n.\nSponsored and written by\nAcronis\n."

A controller binary was used to communicate with the driver.\n\n\n\nElastic’s analysis of AbyssWorker revealed that the driver sets up a protection feature during initialization, by searching for and stripping any handles to its client process in other processes.\n\n\n\nOnce up and running, the driver can perform requests for a broad range of operations, including process manipulation, file manipulation, process tampering, API loading, hook removal, driver termination, and system reboot, which enables it to terminate and permanently disable security tools.Advertisement.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nNetSfere Integrates ML-KEM and AES into its text, voice and video messaging platform to meet 2027 NSA Quantum Security mandates.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nCommunications services provider NetSfere has upgraded its platform to use a combination of NIST recommended and NSA required ML-KEM and AES algorithms.\nThe NSA has specified, “CNSSP 15 states that by January 1, 2027, all new acquisitions for NationalSecurity Systems (NSS) will be required to be CNSA 2.0 compliant unless otherwise noted.” Removing the less common acronyms, this says the encryption policy wonks at the NSA require most government agencies, military and intelligence operators and sectors of the critical infrastructure should only be able to buy new services or products that are NIST PQC compliant within less than two years from now.\n\n\n\nWhile the organizations themselves have until 2035 to complete their migration to NIST standard quantum-resilient encryption, vendors wishing to sell their goods into the NSS market have only until January 1, 2027, to ensure their products already employ NIST standard PQC.\n\n\n\nWe are seeing, and will increasingly see, new product announcements stressing their PQC creds. On March 18, 2025, HP announced new quantum ready printers. On March 24, 2025, NetSfere announced “the world’s first and only quantum-proof secure communication platform”. It is primarily the company’s existing communication platform upgraded to quantum-readiness and therefore available to the NSS market both now and after 2027.\n\n\n\nWithin the platform, NetSfere has put special emphasis into its end-to-end encrypted messaging able to handle text, voice and video. The firm sees mobile chats increasingly emerging from personal comms into a major part of business communication, and it offers the enterprise a way to incorporate mobile messaging into the organization in a secure and manageable format.\n\n\n\nThe key factor is that this is true end-to-end encryption with quantum ready algorithms. Keys are shared from source to destination, using FIPS 203 ML-KEM (Kyber). The message is encrypted with AES 256, which – while not a new symmetric algorithm – is considered by NIST to be quantum resistant.\n\n\n\nNIST also urges that crypto agility be built into the migration to QPC. It is the nature of cryptographic algorithms to sooner or later be broken. For example, in August 2022, it emerged that one of the finalists in NIST’s competition to find new quantum-proof algorithms had already been broken by a combination of AI and a classic PC.\n\n\n\nCrypto agility requires that if the algorithm in use is broken or fails for any reason, it can be easily swapped out for an alternative (unbroken) algorithm. Right now there is no standardized quantum proof key encapsulation mechanism available as a backup to ML-KEM, although HQC has been chosen by NIST to become one.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“We don’t believe that ML-KEM is going to be broken anytime soon,” Anurag Lal, CEO at NetSfere, told SecurityWeek. “But the good news is that we built NetSfere with a crypto agile platform, allowing us to move from one algorithm to another efficiently and seamlessly. So, if there is ever a need to swap out ML-KEM and an alternative to swap in – whether it is HQC or anything else – we are confident that we have the agility to do that.”\n\n\n\nThe NetSfere platform is a ‘product’ paid for, and therefore loosely ‘owned’ by, individual companies. This provides numerous advantages to both the users and NetSfere. For example, platform management is controlled by the customer, not by the provider. This allows versatility and flexibility – for example, in the use of MFA. Most delivery of one-time MFA is via a mobile device. This can be problematic for secure mobile messaging. If the phone is stolen, the attacker has access to both the means of communicating, and the one-time code that supposedly proves he is the genuine user. NIST has gone further and deprecated the use of SMS to deliver MFA at all.\n\n\n\nNetSfere offers delivery by email, which – done properly – could be more secure. But it may not be realistic or efficient for a traveling businessperson needing a quick and urgent response from the office. So, NetSfere still offers the choice of MFA sent direct to the phone (SMS). The choice is a risk management decision, but one made and implemented by the company – on demand – rather than by NetSfere.\n\n\n\nAnother advantage of user ownership for both the user and NetSfere is that each company owns, keeps and is responsible for its own encryption keys. NetSfere never sees the keys and cannot be forced or persuaded to hand over what it hasn’t got to law enforcement. While this approach ensures true end-to-end encryption, it also counters the current problem of individual national governments demanding a backdoor into that end-to-end encryption. \n\n\n\nThe UK government, for example, has required Apple (under the Investigatory Powers Act) to give backdoor access for data encrypted between the user and iCloud. The Apple service is called Advanced Data Protection (ADP). Rather than provide the keys or a backdoor, Apple has discontinued its ADP service for the UK – a solution that benefits no-one.\n\n\n\nIf a similar situation arose between any government and NetSfere, the firm could reply, “We don’t have the keys, we don’t own them, they are owned and kept by the customer. If you have a legal right to demand the keys from the customer, just do so.” This should keep most people happy: there is no requirement for a backdoor, while law enforcement can still get legal access.\n\n\n\nNetSfere has announced a quantum-proof, end-to-end encrypted enterprise messaging system that is administered by the enterprise. It is primarily designed for in-company communications but can also be used for secure messaging to outsiders. Its purpose is to combine the business use and advantages of mobile messaging with maximum security. During 2025, we will see more and more providers rapidly implementing the use of quantum proof cryptography in both new and existing products to secure their users and maintain the option of selling into the huge NSS market from 2027.\n\n\n\nRelated: What Microsoft’s Majorana 1 Chip Means for Quantum Decryption\nRelated: QuSecure Banks $28M Series A for Post-Quantum Cryptography Tech\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Quantum and the Threat to Encryption\nRelated: Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards Officially Announced by NIST – a History and Explanation\n\nThe NSA has specified, “CNSSP 15 states that by January 1, 2027, all new acquisitions for NationalSecurity Systems (NSS) will be required to be CNSA 2.0 compliant unless otherwise noted.” Removing the less common acronyms, this says the encryption policy wonks at the NSA require most government agencies, military and intelligence operators and sectors of the critical infrastructure should only be able to buy new services or products that are NIST PQC compliant within less than two years from now.\n\n\n\nWhile the organizations themselves have until 2035 to complete their migration to NIST standard quantum-resilient encryption, vendors wishing to sell their goods into the NSS market have only until January 1, 2027, to ensure their products already employ NIST standard PQC.\n\n\n\nWe are seeing, and will increasingly see, new product announcements stressing their PQC creds.

During 2025, we will see more and more providers rapidly implementing the use of quantum proof cryptography in both new and existing products to secure their users and maintain the option of selling into the huge NSS market from 2027.\n\n\n\nRelated: What Microsoft’s Majorana 1 Chip Means for Quantum Decryption\nRelated: QuSecure Banks $28M Series A for Post-Quantum Cryptography Tech\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Quantum and the Threat to Encryption\nRelated: Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards Officially Announced by NIST – a History and Explanation\n\nNIST also urges that crypto agility be built into the migration to QPC. It is the nature of cryptographic algorithms to sooner or later be broken. For example, in August 2022, it emerged that one of the finalists in NIST’s competition to find new quantum-proof algorithms had already been broken by a combination of AI and a classic PC.\n\n\n\nCrypto agility requires that if the algorithm in use is broken or fails for any reason, it can be easily swapped out for an alternative (unbroken) algorithm. Right now there is no standardized quantum proof key encapsulation mechanism available as a backup to ML-KEM, although HQC has been chosen by NIST to become one.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“We don’t believe that ML-KEM is going to be broken anytime soon,” Anurag Lal, CEO at NetSfere, told SecurityWeek. “But the good news is that we built NetSfere with a crypto agile platform, allowing us to move from one algorithm to another efficiently and seamlessly. So, if there is ever a need to swap out ML-KEM and an alternative to swap in – whether it is HQC or anything else – we are confident that we have the agility to do that.”\n\n\n\nThe NetSfere platform is a ‘product’ paid for, and therefore loosely ‘owned’ by, individual companies. This provides numerous advantages to both the users and NetSfere. For example, platform management is controlled by the customer, not by the provider. This allows versatility and flexibility – for example, in the use of MFA. Most delivery of one-time MFA is via a mobile device. This can be problematic for secure mobile messaging. If the phone is stolen, the attacker has access to both the means of communicating, and the one-time code that supposedly proves he is the genuine user. NIST has gone further and deprecated the use of SMS to deliver MFA at all.\n\n\n\nNetSfere offers delivery by email, which – done properly – could be more secure. But it may not be realistic or efficient for a traveling businessperson needing a quick and urgent response from the office. So, NetSfere still offers the choice of MFA sent direct to the phone (SMS). The choice is a risk management decision, but one made and implemented by the company – on demand – rather than by NetSfere.\n\n\n\nAnother advantage of user ownership for both the user and NetSfere is that each company owns, keeps and is responsible for its own encryption keys. NetSfere never sees the keys and cannot be forced or persuaded to hand over what it hasn’t got to law enforcement. While this approach ensures true end-to-end encryption, it also counters the current problem of individual national governments demanding a backdoor into that end-to-end encryption. \n\n\n\nThe UK government, for example, has required Apple (under the Investigatory Powers Act) to give backdoor access for data encrypted between the user and iCloud. The Apple service is called Advanced Data Protection (ADP). Rather than provide the keys or a backdoor, Apple has discontinued its ADP service for the UK – a solution that benefits no-one.\n\n\n\nIf a similar situation arose between any government and NetSfere, the firm could reply, “We don’t have the keys, we don’t own them, they are owned and kept by the customer. If you have a legal right to demand the keys from the customer, just do so.” This should keep most people happy: there is no requirement for a backdoor, while law enforcement can still get legal access.\n\n\n\nNetSfere has announced a quantum-proof, end-to-end encrypted enterprise messaging system that is administered by the enterprise.

The repository was created in February 2024 and last updated in February 2025.\n\n\n\n“These new versions retrieve their configuration data through the GitHub REST API using a ‘User-Agent’ string labelled ‘Awesome App’. The configuration provides key details about the ransomware’s behavior and operational parameters,” Trend Micro explains.\n\n\n\nThe configuration files reveal that the ransomware ignores dozens of folders when encrypting files, that it targets a broad range of file extensions, and that it attempts to kill numerous processes that might interfere with its operations.\n\n\n\nIn addition to encrypting the victim’s files, Albabat steals data from the machine, storing the collected information in a remote PostgreSQL database.Advertisement.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nPublic officials and private citizens are consistently warned about hacking and data leaks, but technologies designed to increase privacy often decrease government transparency.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nAs a devastating wildfire burned through a Maui town, killing more than 100 people, emergency management employees traded dozens of text messages, creating a record that would later help investigators piece together the government’s response to the 2023 tragedy.\nOne text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.\n\n\n\n“That’s what Signal was supposed to be for,” then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.\n\n\n\nSignal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.\n\n\n\nWhile such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren’t returned under public information requests.\n\n\n\nAn Associated Press review in all 50 states found accounts on encrypted platforms registered to cellphone numbers for over 1,100 government workers and elected officials.\n\n\n\nIt’s unclear if Maui officials actually used the app or simply considered it — a county spokesperson did not respond to questions — but the situation highlights a growing challenge: How can government entities use technological advancements for added security while staying on the right side of public information laws?\n\n\n\nHow common is governmental use of encryption apps?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThe AP found accounts for state, local and federal officials in nearly every state, including many legislators and their staff, but also staff for governors, state attorneys general, education departments and school board members.\n\n\n\nThe AP is not naming the officials because having an account is neither against the rules in most states, nor proof they use the apps for government business. While many of those accounts were registered to government cellphone numbers, some were registered to personal numbers. The AP’s list is likely incomplete because users can make accounts unsearchable.\n\n\n\nImproper use of the apps has been reported over the past decade in places like Missouri, Oregon, Oklahoma, Maryland and elsewhere, almost always because of leaked messages.\n\n\n\nWhat’s the problem?\nPublic officials and private citizens are consistently warned about hacking and data leaks, but technologies designed to increase privacy often decrease government transparency.\n\n\n\nApps like Signal, WhatsApp, Confide, Telegram and others use encryption to scramble messages so only the intended end-user can read them, and they typically aren’t stored on government servers. Some automatically delete messages, and some prevent users from screenshotting or sharing messages.\n\n\n\n“The fundamental problem is that people do have a right to use encrypted apps for their personal communications, and have those on their personal devices. That’s not against the law,” said Matt Kelly, editor of Radical Compliance, a newsletter that focuses on corporate compliance and governance issues. “But how would an organization be able to distinguish how an employee is using it?”\n\n\n\nAre there acceptable government uses of end-to-end encryption apps?\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, has recommended that “highly valued targets” — senior officials who handle sensitive information — use encryption apps for confidential communications. Those communications are not typically releasable under public record laws.\n\n\n\nCISA leaders also say encrypted communications could be a useful security measure for the public, but did not encourage government officials to use the apps to skirt public information laws.\n\n\n\nJournalists, including many at the AP, often use encrypted messages when talking to sources or whistleblowers.\n\n\n\nWhat are states doing?\nWhile some cities and states are grappling with how to stay transparent, public record laws aren’t evolving as quickly as technology, said Smarsh general manager Lanika Mamac. The Portland, Oregon-based company helps governments and businesses archive digital communications.\n\n\n\n“People are worried more about cybersecurity attacks. They’re trying to make sure it’s secure,” Mamac said. “I think that they are really trying to figure out, ‘How do I balance being secure and giving transparency?’”\n\n\n\nMamac said Smarsh has seen an uptick in inquiries, mostly from local governments. But many others have done little to restrict the apps or clarify rules for their use.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the New Mexico Child, Youth and Families Department’s new division director told employees to use the app Signal for internal communications and to delete messages after 24 hours. A 2021 investigation into the possible violation of New Mexico’s document retention rules was followed by a court settlement with two whistleblowers and the division director’s departure.\n\n\n\nBut New Mexico still lacks regulations on using encrypted apps. The AP’s review found at least three department or agency directors had Signal accounts as of December 2024.\n\n\n\nIn Michigan, State Police leaders were found in 2021 to be using Signal on state-issued cellphones. Michigan lawmakers responded by banning the use of encrypted messaging apps on state employees’ work-issued devices if they hinder public record requests.\n\n\n\nHowever, Michigan’s law did not include penalties for violations, and monitoring the government-owned devices used by 48,000 executive branch employees is a monumental task.\n\n\n\nWhat’s the solution?\nThe best remedy is stronger public record laws, said David Cuillier, director of the Brechner Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. Most state laws already make clear that the content of communication — not the method — is what makes something a public record, but many of those laws lack teeth, he said.\n\n\n\n“They should only be using apps if they are able to report the communications and archive them like any other public record,” he said.\n\n\n\nGenerally, Cuillier said, there’s been a decrease in government transparency over the past few decades. To reverse that, governments could create independent enforcement agencies, add punishments for violations, and create a transparent culture that supports technology, he said.\n\n\n\n“We used to be a beacon of light when it came to transparency. Now, we’re not. We have lost our way,” Cuillier said.\n\n\n\nRelated: NetSfere Launches Quantum-Resilient Messaging Platform for Enterprise and Government Use\nRelated: Surveillance ‘Existential’ Danger of Tech: Signal Boss\n\nOne text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.\n\n\n\n“That’s what Signal was supposed to be for,” then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.\n\n\n\nSignal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.\n\n\n\nWhile such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making.

Most state laws already make clear that the content of communication — not the method — is what makes something a public record, but many of those laws lack teeth, he said.\n\n\n\n“They should only be using apps if they are able to report the communications and archive them like any other public record,” he said.\n\n\n\nGenerally, Cuillier said, there’s been a decrease in government transparency over the past few decades.

Now, we’re not. We have lost our way,” Cuillier said.\n\n\n\nRelated: NetSfere Launches Quantum-Resilient Messaging Platform for Enterprise and Government Use\nRelated: Surveillance ‘Existential’ Danger of Tech: Signal Boss\n\nWhile some cities and states are grappling with how to stay transparent, public record laws aren’t evolving as quickly as technology, said Smarsh general manager Lanika Mamac. The Portland, Oregon-based company helps governments and businesses archive digital communications.\n\n\n\n“People are worried more about cybersecurity attacks. They’re trying to make sure it’s secure,” Mamac said. “I think that they are really trying to figure out, ‘How do I balance being secure and giving transparency?’”\n\n\n\nMamac said Smarsh has seen an uptick in inquiries, mostly from local governments. But many others have done little to restrict the apps or clarify rules for their use.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the New Mexico Child, Youth and Families Department’s new division director told employees to use the app Signal for internal communications and to delete messages after 24 hours.
