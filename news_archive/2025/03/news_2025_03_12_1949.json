This is accomplished by gaining privileged access to a router from a terminal server used for managing network devices using legitimate credentials.\nThe elevated permissions are then used to inject the malicious payloads into the memory of a legitimate cat process, resulting in the execution of the lmpad backdoor while veriexec is enabled.\n\"The main purpose of this malware is to disable all possible logging before the operator connects to the router to perform hands-on activities and then later restore the logs after the operator disconnects,\" Mandiant noted.\nSome of the other tools deployed by UNC3886 include rootkits like Reptile and Medusa; PITHOOK to hijack SSH authentications and capture SSH credentials; and GHOSTTOWN for anti-forensics purposes.\nOrganizations are recommended to upgrade their Juniper devices to the\nlatest images\nreleased by Juniper Networks, which includes mitigations and updated signatures for the Juniper Malware Removal Tool (\nJMRT\n).\nThe development comes a little over a month after Lumen Black Lotus Labs\nrevealed\nthat enterprise-grade Juniper Networks routers have become the target of a custom backdoor as part of a campaign dubbed J-magic that delivers a variant of a known backdoor named cd00r.\n\"The malware deployed on Juniper Networks' Junos OS routers demonstrates that UNC3886 has in-depth knowledge of advanced system internals,\" Mandiant researchers said.\n\"Furthermore, UNC3886 continues to prioritize stealth in its operations through the use of passive backdoors, together with log and forensics artifact tampering, indicating a focus on long-term persistence, while minimizing the risk of detection.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "We've been hearing the same story for years: AI is coming for your job. In fact, in 2017, McKinsey printed a report,\nJobs Lost, Jobs Gained: Workforce Transitions in a Time of Automation\n, predicting that by 2030, 375 million workers would need to find new jobs or risk being displaced by AI and automation.\nQueue the anxiety.\nThere have been ongoing whispers about what roles would be impacted, and pentesting has recently come into question. With AI now able to automate tasks such as vulnerability scans and network scans—among other things—and with platforms like\nPlexTrac adding AI capabilities\nto cut back on the manual effort, will pentesters be out of a job?\nLet's start with some optimism. This year, McKinsey retracted its former prediction that 375 million workers would be displaced by AI, lowering the prediction to roughly 92 million workers. The article continued to ease concern stating that although some jobs may become obsolete, it's more likely that jobs will simply undergo a transition and that an estimated 170 million new roles will emerge from the ashes.\nCircling back to pentesting, it's fair to assume that some aspects of the role will lend itself more to automation in the coming years, and some pentesting-related roles might have to pivot, but AI is missing an element that sets pentesting apart from other automated scanner tools: the human element. As cited by the Cloud Security Alliance, \"Rather than replacing humans, AI serves as a force multiplier for penetration testers.\"\nAI Will Enhance, Not Replace, Pentesting Capabilities\nOne common misconception is that AI will make pentesters a thing of the past. The reality is far more nuanced. Automation has already begun to assist in streamlining some of the more monotonous, repetitive tasks, but human creativity and expertise remain irreplaceable.\nThe Script Kiddies Are (Machine) Learning\nAI is changing the barriers to entry for pentesting. With the help of AI-powered tools, folks with less technical experience—often referred to as\nscript kiddies\n—will be able to perform more sophisticated tests without needing an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanics. AI lowers the barrier to entry by automating more complex tasks like vulnerability scanning, adversary simulation, and exploitation. Such automation enables these users to identify and exploit weaknesses in systems with greater ease.\nWhile pentesters may have a negative view of script kiddies, the advancements in AI and automation benefit everyone. Removing low-hanging fruit allows testers of all levels to take on more intricate and valuable engagements, raising their skill level and making them more effective and secure in their roles. With AI handling the tedious groundwork, all testers can focus on learning the deeper nuances of pentesting, ultimately becoming more proficient and contributing more to the security landscape.\nFocusing on Higher-Value Work: Let AI Handle the Monotonous Tasks\nIt's not just script kiddies that will reap the benefits of AI—pentesters can as well. By leveraging automation, pentesters are freed up to focus on tasks that demand a higher level of expertise or human intervention. For instance, AI can automate the discovery of vulnerabilities, allowing pentesters to focus on crafting unique exploits or conducting advanced red team exercises that require a nuanced understanding of human behavior and business logic.\nSpecific tasks AI can automate include:\nFacilitating deeper research and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering\nScanning for common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in target systems\nConducting basic network scans and identifying potential attack vectors\nCategorizing and prioritizing discovered vulnerabilities based on severity and exploitability\nCrafting exploits based on the technology stack of the current engagement\nSuggesting additional test cases to conduct based on previously identified vulnerabilities\nBy eliminating these repetitive tasks, AI allows pentesters to spend more time exploring sophisticated exploits, finding hidden flaws, and thinking outside the box—skills that are beyond AI's reach for the foreseeable future.\nPhishing and Social Engineering 2.0: AI's Hook for Better Simulations\nAI's impact on pentesting is also evident in the realm of social engineering. The technology is already advancing phishing simulations and training exercises. AI's ability to analyze vast amounts of data, understand human behaviors, and craft more believable phishing attacks or social engineering scenarios allows penetration testers to conduct more realistic attacks. This means that businesses can be better prepared for real-world threats, as AI enhances the authenticity of simulated attacks.\nMoreover, AI tools can provide feedback and coaching, allowing penetration testers to refine their social engineering techniques and learn from past engagements, improving their craft over time.\nAI Will Accelerate the Pentesting Process: Speed Meets Precision\nAI can dramatically speed up most, if not all, stages of the penetration testing lifecycle. For example:\nOSINT and Information Gathering:\nAI can analyze an organization's technology stack, identify known vulnerabilities in the tools and platforms in use, and suggest potential attack vectors more quickly than a human could manually research.\nThreat Modeling:\nBased on the data collected, AI can recommend specific threats to emulate based on previous success rates correlated to the gathered intelligence.\nAnomaly Detection:\nWhen sifting through massive datasets, AI excels at detecting patterns and identifying outliers. It can flag anomalous findings that might otherwise be buried in an ocean of data, allowing pentesters to focus on the most critical vulnerabilities.\nExploit Development:\nAI tools can assist pentesters in generating exploit code tailored to the specific technology stack or system they are testing.\nPost Exploitation:\nAI can help cover tracks of exploitation, removing evidence that the testers were even there in a more comprehensive fashion. It can also leave false clues to keep the defenders guessing and lead their investigation down rabbit trails.\nPentest/Offensive Security Reporting:\nJust like GPT tools that help you write an email, you can use generative AI to speed pentest reports. PlexTrac, a leading pentest reporting platform, integrates AI to help generate exploit findings, summarize data, and even draft executive summaries for reports. But, of course, you need to make sure the platform you leverage keeps your data safe.\nPlexTrac's homegrown AI solution\noperates in a pre-trained capacity. The system and underlying components do not learn over time or retain user submissions beyond the requirement to process the submission and provide a generative response.\nWhat to Expect From AI in Pentesting: A Hacker's Best Friend?\nThe future of pentesting will likely involve a synergistic relationship between AI and human expertise. Here's how AI will support pentesters in the near future:\nCollaboration:\nAI can serve as a sidekick to penetration testers, helping to analyze findings, create reports, and even recommend next steps based on past engagements. It can act as a \"red team assistant\" facilitating collaboration among team members and providing guidance throughout the engagement.\nBusiness Logic and Contextual Awareness:\nAI will also help penetration testers understand how vulnerabilities impact the business. Instead of just identifying a technical flaw, AI will provide context on how that flaw could lead to business disruptions, data loss, or reputational damage. This understanding can guide pentesters in crafting more impactful recommendations and reports.\nAgentic Frameworks and Reasoning Models:\nWith advancements in reasoning models, AI can provide insights into why it makes specific decisions, allowing penetration testers to better understand the logic behind its findings and suggestions. This transparency will improve the way humans interact with AI and enhance its effectiveness in pentesting tasks.\nEmbracing Your New Pentest Partner\nAI is not here to take over the job of penetration testers; rather, it is here to make their work faster, more efficient, and more effective. The mundane tasks of scanning for vulnerabilities, writing reports, and even executing basic exploits can be automated, but the nuanced tasks that require creativity, critical thinking, and deep technical knowledge will always need a hacker's touch.\nBy embracing AI as a tool to enhance their work, penetration testers can spend more time on the exciting and challenging aspects of their job—hacking, problem-solving, and outsmarting adversaries. As AI continues to evolve, it's clear that pentesters will be empowered, not displaced. In fact, those who embrace AI will likely find themselves more competitive in an ever-changing cybersecurity landscape.\nResources:\nManyika, James, et al. \"Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained: Workforce Transitions in a Time of Automation.\"McKinsey, December 2017,\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/BAB489A30B724BECB5DEDC41E9BB9FAC.ashx\n.\nMayer, Hannah, et al. \"Superagency in the Workplace: Empowering People to Unlock AI's Full Potential.\" McKinsey , 28 Jan. 2025,\nwww.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work\n.\nMehta, Umang. \"AI-Enhanced Penetration Testing: Redefining Red Team Operations.\" Cloud Security Alliance, 06 December 2024, ​​\nhttps://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2024/12/06/ai-enhanced-penetration-testing-redefining-red-team-operations\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Microsoft on Tuesday\nreleased\nsecurity updates to address 57 security vulnerabilities in its software, including a whopping six zero-days that it said have been actively exploited in the wild.\nOf the 56 flaws, six are rated Critical, 50 are rated Important, and one is rated Low in severity. Twenty-three of the addressed vulnerabilities are remote code execution bugs and 22 relate to privilege escalation.\nThe updates are in addition to\n17 vulnerabilities\nMicrosoft addressed in its Chromium-based Edge browser since the release of\nlast month's Patch Tuesday update\n, one of which is a spoofing flaw specific to the browser (\nCVE-2025-26643\n, CVSS score: 5.4).\nThe six vulnerabilities that have come under active exploitation are listed below -\nCVE-2025-24983\n(CVSS score: 7.0) - A Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability that allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges locally\nCVE-2025-24984\n(CVSS score: 4.6) - A Windows NTFS information disclosure vulnerability that allows an attacker with physical access to a target device and the ability to plug in a malicious USB drive to potentially read portions of heap memory\nCVE-2025-24985\n(CVSS score: 7.8) - An integer overflow vulnerability in Windows Fast FAT File System Driver that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally\nCVE-2025-24991\n(CVSS score: 5.5) - An out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Windows NTFS that allows an authorized attacker to disclose information locally\nCVE-2025-24993\n(CVSS score: 7.8) - A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Windows NTFS that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally\nCVE-2025-26633\n(CVSS score: 7.0) - An improper neutralization vulnerability in Microsoft Management Console that allows an unauthorized attacker to bypass a security feature locally\nESET, which is credited with discovering and reporting CVE-2025-24983, said it first discovered the zero-day exploit in the wild in March 2023 and delivered via a backdoor named PipeMagic on compromised hosts.\n\"The vulnerability is a use-after-free in Win32k driver,\" the Slovakian company\nnoted\n. \"In a certain scenario achieved using the WaitForInputIdle API, the W32PROCESS structure gets dereferenced one more time than it should, causing UAF. To reach the vulnerability, a race condition must be won.\"\nPipeMagic, first discovered in 2022, is a plugin-based trojan that has targeted entities in Asia and Saudi Arabia, with the malware distributed in the form of a fake OpenAI ChatGPT application in late 2024 campaigns.\n\"One of unique features of PipeMagic is that it generates a 16-byte random array to create a named pipe in the format \\\\.\\pipe\\1.<hex string>,\" Kaspersky\nrevealed\nin October 2024. \"It spawns a thread that continuously creates this pipe, reads data from it, and then destroys it.\"\n\"This pipe is used for receiving encoded payloads, stop signals via the default local interface. PipeMagic usually works with multiple plugins downloaded from a command-and-control (C2) server, which, in this case, was hosted on Microsoft Azure.\"\nThe Zero Day Initiative noted that CVE-2025-26633 stems from how MSC files are handled, allowing an attacker to evade file reputation protections and execute code in the context of the current user. The activity has been linked to a threat actor tracked as\nEncryptHub\n(aka LARVA-208).\nAction1\npointed out\nthat threat actors could chain the four vulnerabilities affecting core Windows file system components to cause remote code execution (CVE-2025-24985 and CVE-2025-24993) and information disclosure (CVE-2025-24984 and CVE-2025-24991). All the four bugs were reported anonymously.\n\"Specifically, the exploit relies on the attacker crafting a malicious VHD file and convincing a user to open or mount a VHD file,\" Kev Breen, senior director of threat research at Immersive, said. \"VHDs are Virtual Hard Disks and are typically associated with storing the operating system for virtual machines.\"\n\"Whilst they are more typically associated with Virtual Machines, we have seen examples over the years where threat actors use VHD or VHDX files as part of phishing campaigns to smuggle malware payloads past AV solutions. Depending on the configuration of Windows systems, simply double-clicking on a VHD file could be enough to mount the container and, therefore, execute any payloads contained within the malicious file.\"\nAccording to Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, CVE-2025-26633 is the second flaw in MMC to be exploited in the wild as a zero-day after CVE-2024-43572 and CVE-2025-24985 is the first vulnerability in the Windows Fast FAT File System Driver since March 2022. It's also the first to be exploited in the wild as a zero-day.\nAs is customary, it's currently not known the remaining vulnerabilities are being exploited, in what context, and the exact scale of the attacks. The development has\nprompted\nthe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add them to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (\nKEV\n) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the fixes by April 1, 2025.\nSoftware Patches from Other Vendors\nIn addition to Microsoft, security updates have also been released by other vendors over the past several weeks to rectify several vulnerabilities, including —\nAdobe\nAmazon Web Services\nAMD\nApple\nAtlassian\nBroadcom\n(including VMware)\nCanon\nCisco\nCitrix\nD-Link\nDell\nDrupal\nF5\nFortinet\nGitLab\nGoogle\nAndroid\nand\nPixel\nGoogle Chrome\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Wear OS\nHitachi Energy\nHP\nHP Enterprise\n(including Aruba Networking)\nIBM\nIvanti\nJenkins\nLenovo\nLibreOffice\nLinux distributions\nAmazon Linux\n,\nDebian\n,\nOracle Linux\n,\nRed Hat\n,\nRocky Linux\n,\nSUSE\n, and\nUbuntu\nMediaTek\nMitsubishi Electric\nMoxa\nMozilla\nFirefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird\nNVIDIA\nQNAP\nQualcomm\nRockwell Automation\nSamsung\nSAP\nSchneider Electric\nSiemens\nSynology\nVeritas\nZimbra\nZoho ManageEngine\nZoom\n, and\nZyxel\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "CISA says the Medusa ransomware operation has impacted over 300 organizations in critical infrastructure sectors in the United States until last month.\nThis was revealed in a\njoint advisory\nissued today in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC).\n\"As of February 2025, Medusa developers and affiliates have impacted over 300 victims from a variety of critical infrastructure sectors with affected industries including medical, education, legal, insurance, technology, and manufacturing,\" CISA, the FBI, and MS-ISAC warned on Wednesday.\n\"FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Medusa ransomware incidents.\"\nAs the advisory explains, to defend against Medusa ransomware attacks, defenders are advised to take the following measures:\nMitigate known security vulnerabilities to ensure operating systems, software, and firmware are patched within a reasonable timeframe,\nSegment networks to limit lateral movement between infected devices and other devices within the organization, and\nFilter network traffic by blocking access from unknown or untrusted origins to remote services on internal systems.\nMedusa ransomware surfaced almost four years ago, in January 2021, but the gang's activity only picked up\ntwo years later\n, in 2023, when it launched the Medusa Blog leak site to pressure victims into paying ransoms using stolen data as leverage.\nSince it emerged, the gang has claimed over 400 victims worldwide and gained media attention in March 2023 after claiming responsibility for an\nattack on the Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS) district\nand sharing a video of the stolen data.\nThe group also leaked files allegedly stolen from Toyota Financial Services, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, on its dark extortion portal in November 2023 after the company refused to pay an $8 million ransom demand and\nnotified customers of a data breach\n.\nMedusa was first introduced as a closed ransomware variant, where a single group of threat actors handled all development and operations. Although Medusa has since evolved into a Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation and adopted an affiliate model, its developers continue to oversee essential operations, including ransom negotiations.\n\"Medusa developers typically recruit initial access brokers (IABs) in cybercriminal forums and marketplaces to obtain initial access to potential victims,\" they added. \"Potential payments between $100 USD and $1 million USD are offered to these affiliates with the opportunity to work exclusively for Medusa.\"\nIt's also important to note that multiple malware families and cybercrime operations call themselves Medusa, including a\nMirai-based botnet\nwith ransomware capabilities and an\nAndroid malware-as-a-service\n(MaaS) operation discovered in 2020 (also known as TangleBot).\nDue to this commonly used name, there's also been some confusing reporting about Medusa ransomware, with many thinking it's the same as the widely known\nMedusaLocker ransomware operation\n, although they're entirely different operations.\nLast month, CISA and the FBI\nissued another joint alert\nwarning that victims from multiple industry sectors across over 70 countries, including critical infrastructure, have been breached in Ghost ransomware attacks.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nCISA and FBI: Ghost ransomware breached orgs in 70 countries\nCISA: Hackers still exploiting older Ivanti bugs to breach networks\nCISA tags critical Ivanti EPM flaws as actively exploited in attacks\nCritical Ivanti RCE flaw with public exploit now used in attacks\nMicrosoft: North Korean hackers join Qilin ransomware gang"

        "Content": "A new Android spyware named 'KoSpy' is linked to North Korean threat actors who have infiltrated Google Play and third-party app store APKPure through at least five malicious apps.\nAccording to Lookout researchers, the spyware is attributed to the North Korean threat group APT37 (aka 'ScarCruft'). The campaign has been active since March 2022, with the threat actors actively developing the malware based on newer samples.\nThe spyware campaign primarily targets Korean and English-speaking users by disguising itself as file managers, security tools, and software updaters.\nThe five apps Lookout identified are\n휴대폰 관리자 (Phone Manager)\n,\nFile Manager (com.file.exploer)\n,\n스마트 관리자 (Smart Manager)\n,\n카카오 보안 (Kakao Security)\n, and\nSoftware Update Utility\n.\nMalicious app on Google Play\nSource: Lookout\nThe malicious apps offer at least some of the promised functionality but load the KoSpy spyware in the background.\nThe only exception is Kakao Security, which only displays a fake system window while requesting access to risky permissions.\nInterface of KoSpy apps\nSource: Lookout\nThe campaign was attributed to\nAPT37\nbased on IP addresses previously linked to North Korean operations, domains that facilitated the distribution of\nKonni malware\n, and infrastructure that overlaps with APT43, another DPRK-sponsored threat group.\nKoSpy details\nOnce active on the device, KoSpy retrieves an encrypted configuration file from a Firebase Firestore database to evade detection.\nNext, it connects to the actual command and control (C2) server and runs checks to ensure it's not running in an emulator. The malware can retrieve updated settings from the C2, additional payloads to execute, and be activated/deactivated dynamically via an \"on/off\" switch.\nKoSpy's data collection capabilities are:\nSMS and call logs interception\nTracks victim's GPS location in real-time\nReads and exfiltrates files from local storage\nUses the device's microphone to record audio\nUses the device's camera to capture photos and videos\nCaptures screenshots of the device display\nRecords keystrokes via Android Accessibility Services\nEach app uses a separate Firebase project and C2 server for the data exfiltration, which is encrypted with a hardcoded AES key prior to transmission.\nAlthough the spyware apps have now been removed from both Google Play and APKPure, users will need to manually uninstall them and scan them with security tools to uproot any remnants of the infection from their devices. In critical cases, a factory reset is recommended.\nGoogle Play Protect is also able to block known malicious apps, so enabling it on up-to-date Android devices can help protect against KoSpy.\nA Google spokesperson confirmed to BleepingComputer that all the KoSpy apps\nidentified by Lookout\nhave been removed from Google Play and that the corresponding Firebase projects have also been taken down.\n\"The use of regional language suggests this was intended as targeted malware.

        "Date": "2025-03-12",
        "Content": "For years, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions focused on email, endpoints, and network traffic, where security teams could enforce clear policies with predictable outcomes.\nBut work has changed. Employees aren’t just moving data through controlled corporate channels anymore—they’re copying, pasting, uploading, and transferring sensitive information through the browser every day.\nInline DLP was never built to control how employees handle data inside SaaS applications. Personal and corporate accounts blur together while newly adopted Gen-AI tools and browser extensions quietly expand the risk surface.\nThe browser is now the largest data exfiltration point, yet security strategies remain stuck in a perimeter-based world. The real challenge isn’t just detecting data loss; it’s understanding why traditional defenses keep missing it.\nHow Data Loss Happens in the Browser\nData exfiltration no longer happens through obvious channels like USB drives or unauthorized email attachments. Instead, employees unknowingly expose data as they work in the web browser.\nA developer pastes API keys into ChatGPT, exposing credentials. A sales rep exports CRM contacts to a personal Google Sheet, revealing confidential customer data. A marketing manager grants OAuth permissions to an AI tool, unknowingly allowing ongoing data access.\nWhile not blatant security violations, these routine actions bypass controls because the data never officially leaves an approved app. The browser is now the main channel for this data movement with employees uploading, copying, and transferring sensitive information across several SaaS applications, each handling data differently.\nThis growing usage of applications has made enforcing consistent DLP policies increasingly complex.\nData exposure goes beyond uploads:\nSensitive data now moves beyond file transfers, with copy-paste actions, browser extensions, and Gen-AI prompts enabling data exposure.\nCloud storage obfuscates data movement:\nMany SaaS providers leverage AWS, Azure, or GCP for backend storage and signed requests, making it difficult to trace uploads back to specific applications.\nData sprawl across browsers:\nEmployees use Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari, each creating monitoring blind spots for security teams.\nTo better understand where data is going, we have analyzed the top shared storage destinations across browsers, revealing how most activity is a blend of personal and work behavior.\nMetrics pulled from Keep Aware users in recent State of Browser Security report\n1. The Hidden Risk of Personal Accounts\nPersonal accounts are one of the most overlooked and significant sources of data loss. Employees regularly switch between work and personal accounts within the same browser session, especially in Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, ChatGPT, and Dropbox, blurring the line between corporate and unmanaged environments.\nIn our recent\nState of Browser Security report\n, we highlight the scale of this risk:\n39% of all browser activity on Google web apps involves personal accounts.\n34% of upload events on managed devices go to personal accounts.\nEmployees aren’t typically acting maliciously, but it’s easy for resumes, tax forms, and personal information to creep into daily work on corporate devices, often through personal cloud storage, email, or messaging apps.\nWithout browser-based policies, security teams have no control over whether data is moving to an approved business account or an unmanaged personal one.\nBlocking all personal uploads is neither practical nor effective. Instead, organizations need browser-enforced policies that differentiate between corporate and personal usage, ensuring data stays within sanctioned environments without disrupting legitimate work.\nReal-Time Browser Threat Response With Keep Aware\nKeep Aware provides security teams with instant visibility into browser activity. With click-by-click telemetry, DOM-tree analysis, and threat blocking capabilities, you can detect and stop malicious activity where it starts. Gain full investigative power and ensure browser threats are stopped before they harm your users, data, or apps.\nRequest a Demo\n2. Data in Motion is Most at Risk\nOrganizations are rapidly adopting data classification and labeling to manage sensitive information. Tools like Microsoft Purview have expanded classification efforts, but these solutions focus primarily on data at rest, leaving a major enforcement gap when data is in motion.\nIdentifying sensitive data is only half the battle; securing it as it moves through SaaS applications, browsers, and collaboration tools is the real challenge.\nUnsurprisingly, most data loss happens when information is actively handled, shared, or transferred. The same SaaS apps that drive productivity also introduce high-risk data exposure:\nGoogle Drive and Gmail\nstore business documents—but also personal tax forms.\nSlack\nenables team discussions—but also unauthorized file sharing.\nChatGPT\nsummarizes reports—but can just as easily ingest confidential contracts.\nTraditional security models assume that blocking known exfiltration channels is enough. Yet when the most commonly used business apps are the most common sources of data loss, relying on static controls no longer works. Organizations need real-time enforcement at the browser level to secure data in motion, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected without disrupting productivity.\n3. Extensions and Shadow IT: A Hidden Backdoor\nBeyond direct data exfiltration, browser extensions and shadow IT services create another major security gap. Employees install plugins and grant permissions to apps every day often without realizing how much access they are giving away.\nMalicious Extensions:\nAttackers use extensions to siphon data, capture keystrokes, and extract authentication tokens.\nConsent Phishing:\nEmployees are tricked into granting excessive OAuth permissions, allowing continuous data access even after they log out.\nThird-Party Integrations:\nAI tools, note-taking apps, and automation services often request broad data permissions that security teams can’t easily monitor.\nThird-party components and offerings that attackers infiltrate as part of web supply chain attacks\nThe Browser is the New Security Perimeter\nThe browser has become the most critical yet overlooked layer of enterprise security. Existing controls were built for email and endpoints, not modern work where everything is handled through the browser. Real-time detection and response in the browser is no longer optional.\nSecurity teams need visibility inside applications, not just where data is going. Blocking exfiltration isn’t enough and proactive protection must happen at the source.\nA browser-based DLP model ensures security follows the data, applying consistent protection without disrupting work.

        "Content": "Chinese hackers are deploying custom backdoors on Juniper Networks Junos OS MX routers that have reached end-of-life (EoL) and no longer receive security updates.\nThe backdoors are primarily variants of the TinyShell malware, an open-source tool that facilitates data exchange and command execution on Linux systems, and which has been used by\nmultiple threat groups\nover the years.\nThe attacks were discovered in mid-2024 by Mandiant, who attributed the attacks to a cyberespionage threat actor known as UNC3886.\n\"In mid 2024, Mandiant discovered threat actors deployed custom backdoors operating on Juniper Networks' Junos OS routers,\" explains a\nnew report by Mandiant\n.\n\"Mandiant attributed these backdoors to the China-nexus espionage group, UNC3886. Mandiant uncovered several TINYSHELL based backdoors operating on Juniper Networks' Junos OS routers.\"\nThis threat actor is known for sophisticated attacks utilizing zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise virtualization platforms and edge networking devices.\nIn 2023, Chinese hackers were behind a series of attacks on government organizations\nusing a Fortinet zero-day vulnerability\n(CVE-2022-41328) to deploy custom backdoors. Later that year, the threat actors\nexploited a VMware ESXi zero-day\nvulnerability to backdoor ESXi hosts.\nAttacking Juniper routers with 6 backdoors\nMandiant has observed UNC3886 attacks starting from terminal servers used for managing network devices, where the threat actors used compromised credentials to access the Junos OS CLI and escalate to FreeBSD shell mode.\nThe researchers note that Junos OS has a file integrity system named 'Veriexec' that prevents unauthorized code from running on devices. However, they discovered that code injected into trusted processes could still be executed.\n\"Veriexec protection prevents unauthorized binaries from executing. This poses a challenge for threat actors, as disabling veriexec can trigger alerts,\" explains the Mandiant researchers.\n\"However, execution of untrusted code is still possible if it occurs within the context of a trusted process. Mandiant's investigation revealed that UNC3886 was able to circumvent this protection by injecting malicious code into the memory of a legitimate process.\"\nUtilizing this method, UNC3886 installed the six custom backdoors on the MX routers, all based on TinyShell:\nappid\n– Active backdoor which mimics the legitimate process' appidd.' It establishes a remote shell session, allows uploading/downloading files, and can act as a proxy for malicious traffic.\nto\n– Active backdoor which mimics the legitimate process' top.' It functions similarly to appid but uses different command-and-control (C2) addresses.\nirad\n– A passive backdoor that mimics the legitimate process' irad.' It operates as a packet sniffer backdoor, remaining dormant until activated by a magic ICMP string embedded in network traffic. Once triggered, it establishes a remote shell session while evading traditional detection methods.\njdosd\n– A passive backdoor that mimics the legitimate 'jddosd' process. It listens on UDP port 33512 and activates when it receives a magic value (0xDEADBEEF) from the attacker. Once enabled, it provides remote shell access, allowing attackers to execute commands covertly.\noemd\n– Passive backdoor which mimics the legitimate process 'oamd.' It is designed to be network-activated, binding itself to specific network interfaces rather than a fixed port. It communicates with C2 over TCP using AES encryption to ensure stealthy, encrypted control.\nlmpad\n– A utility and passive backdoor that mimics the legitimate 'lmpd' process. It is primarily used to turn off logging and security monitoring before an attack, modifying Juniper's SNMP and management daemons to prevent detection. After attacker operations, it can restore logs, erasing forensic traces of the intrusion.\nFor stealth and persistence, each of the six backdoors used by UNC3886 in the attacks has a distinct C2 communication method and uses a separate set of hardcoded C2 server addresses.\nGiven that UNC3886 targets end-of-life Juniper MX routers, the priority should be replacing these devices with new models that are actively supported and then upgrading those to the latest firmware.\nAlthough Juniper did not release fixes this time, the vendor\npublished a bulletin\nthat includes mitigation recommendations and updated signatures for its Juniper Malware Removal Tool (\nJMRT\n).\nSystem administrators should also strengthen authentication security by using a centralized Identity & Access Management (IAM) system and enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all network devices.\nA complete list of the indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to this campaign and YARA and Snort/Suricata rules are provided at the bottom of Mandiant's report.\nJuniper routers were also previously targeted in\nJ-Magic malware attacks\nthat opened a reverse shell to the device when it received specially crafted packets.

        "Content": "Microsoft says that some USB printers will start printing random text after installing Windows updates released since late January 2025.\nThe known issue affects Windows 10 (version 22H2) and Windows 11 (versions 22H2 and 23H2), but according to an update to the Windows release health dashboard, the latest Windows 11 24H2 is not impacted.\n\"After installing the January 2025 Windows preview update (\nKB5050092\n), released January 29, 2025, or later updates, you might observe issues with USB connected dual-mode printers that support both USB Print and IPP Over USB protocols,\"\nRedmond explains\n.\n\"You might observe that the printer unexpectedly prints random text and data, including network commands and unusual characters.\"\nOn affected systems, users will often see erroneously printed text that begins with the header \"POST /ipp/print HTTP/1.1,\" followed by other IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) related issues headers.\nThese printing issues are more frequent when the printer is turned on or reconnected after being disconnected. Affected users will observe the printer unexpectedly printing when the print spooler sends IPP protocol messages to the printer and the printer driver is installed on the Windows device.\n​Fixed via Known Issue Rollback\nMicrosoft has resolved these printing issues through Known Issue Rollback (KIR)—a Windows feature that helps reverse flawed non-security updates delivered via Windows Update—and says the fix will also roll out automatically with a future Windows update.\nTo resolve the known issue on impacted Windows enterprise-managed devices, IT admins must install and set up the following group policies:\nWindows 11 22H2 KB5050092 250131_150523 Known Issue Rollback\nWindows 10 22H2, 21H1, 21H2 and 22H2 KB5050081 250131_082569 Known Issue Rollback\nAfter installation, the Group Policy can be found under Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates.\nTo deploy the Known Issue Rollback, you must go to the Local Computer Policy or the Domain policy on the domain controller using the Group Policy Editor to choose the Windows version that needs to be targeted. Next, restart the affected devices to apply the group policy setting.\nIT admins can find further guidance on deploying and configuring KIR Group Policies on the\nMicrosoft support website\n.\nEarlier this week,\nMicrosoft also lifted a compatibility hold\nthat blocked some AutoCAD users from upgrading to Windows 11 24H2 due to launch and crash issues.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft: January Windows security updates break audio playback\nWindows BitLocker bug triggers warnings on devices with TPMs\nWindows 10 KB5052077 update fixes broken SSH connections\nMicrosoft testing fix for Windows 11 bug breaking SSH connections\nMicrosoft rolls out BIOS update that fixes ASUS blue screen issues"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nOrganizations must recognize that security is not about the number of tools deployed, it is about ensuring those tools effectively disrupt the attack chain at every stage.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nNAC, SDN, SASE, CASB, IDaaS, PAM, IGA, SIEM, TI, EDR, MDR, XDR, CTEM—the list goes on. If this “alphabet soup” sounds familiar, it is because organizations worldwide are deploying an array of security tools, all promising protection against data breaches. Global spending on information security is projected to reach $212 billion in 2025, a 15.1% increase from 2024, according to a recent Gartner forecast.\n\n\n\nWith such significant investments, one might assume we are several steps ahead of cybercriminals. Yet, hardly a week goes by without a new high-profile cyberattack—whether it’s the mass exploitation of a PHP vulnerability, data breaches across multiple healthcare organizations, or ransomware attacks on enterprises like Tata Technologies.\n\n\n\nThis raises a crucial question: Are we focusing on the right security measures? The sheer number of tools deployed does not determine an organization’s cyber resilience. What truly matters is the efficacy of these security controls and the ability to disrupt the attack chain in its early stages. To achieve this, organizations must understand the anatomy of a cyberattack.\n\n\n\nThe Reality of Cyberattacks\nFor years, cyberattacks have been portrayed as sophisticated operations exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, requiring advanced coding techniques to break through seemingly impenetrable defenses. The reality is quite different:\n\n\n\nToday, cyber adversaries are not hacking in—they are logging in. Attackers primarily exploit weak, stolen, or compromised credentials. According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 80% of breaches involve phishing and credential misuse.\n\n\n\nDespite this, many organizations still allocate the largest share of their security budget to perimeter defenses rather than investing in controls that address the most common attack vectors: credential abuse and compromised endpoints.\n\n\n\nThis is a critical mistake. To build an effective cybersecurity strategy, organizations must understand how hackers operate, identifying their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This requires a deep dive into the cyberattack lifecycle.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThe Anatomy of a Cyberattack\nWhile various models exist to describe the cyberattack lifecycle—also known as the kill chain—most follow the same fundamental three-phase structure.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nExploiting trust in the DeepSeek brand, scammers attempt to harvest personal information or steal user credentials.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nIn recent months, DeepSeek, an advanced AI large language model from China, has garnered significant attention as a strong contender to ChatGPT. Its sudden rise is attracting not only legitimate users and developers but also malicious actors and scammers. Per recent reports, scammers have begun deceiving individuals and organizations by employing different tactics and capitalizing on the public’s curiosity and lack of familiarity with the technology. Let’s understand in more detail how scammers are exploiting the DeepSeek hype.\n\n\n\nFake Websites\nResearchers tracked thousands of look-alike domain names and fake websites (around 2,600 websites surfaced between December 1, 2024 and February 3, 2025) impersonating DeepSeek. Some websites such as deepseek-login[.]com, were aimed at stealing user credentials, while others tricked users into downloading malware (example: Fake Captcha). Certain fake websites, like the one claiming to offer a DeepSeek API ‘Plateform,’ [sic] are easily identifiable. But others, for example, credential phishing pages, are said to be well designed, making them harder to spot. Although the cybersecurity community has made considerable effort  taking these mock sites down, dozens of new ones crop up weekly.\n\n\n\nFake Developer Tools\nThreat actors uploaded two malicious Python packages—”deepseeek” and “deepseekai”—to the Python Package Index (PyPI), a widely used repository for Python software. These packages, masquerading as developer tools for DeepSeek, were designed to steal sensitive user and system data, including API keys, database credentials, and access tokens. The stolen information was exfiltrated to a command-and-control server using Pipedream, a legitimate automation platform. When these malicious packages were discovered, researchers reported them to PyPI, which then promptly removed them. However, by then, 222 developers, primarily from the U.S. and China, had already downloaded them.\n\n\n\nFake Social Media Accounts\nDeepSeek has reported that it is battling a barrage of fake social media accounts. In a recent public statement, they stated discovering numerous fake accounts impersonating DeepSeek on social media, spreading misinformation and scams, misleading users into believing they were engaging with the authentic company. DeepSeek clarified that it operates only three official accounts – on WeChat, X, and Chinese social media app, RedNote  – warning users of imposters charging fees or promoting bogus cryptocurrencies. DeepSeek also alerted users of a fraudulent account on X impersonating its founder, Liang Wenfeng.\n\n\n\nFake Investment and Cryptocurrency SchemesAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nResearchers encountered deceptive sites that mimic DeepSeek and trick users into scanning QR codes that compromise their crypto wallets. Once users connect their wallets, the QR code leads to financial theft. Scammers also promoted a fake DeepSeekAI agent token, which was identified as a honeypot token, rendering purchased tokens worthless. Another fraud involved a fraudulent site, “deepseek-shares.com,” claiming to sell DeepSeek pre-IPO shares. Since DeepSeek is privately held with no official plans of going public, these scams aim to steal sensitive user information and commit victims to financial fraud.\n\n\n\nFake Bots And Telegram Channels\nA scam involving a fake bot page promoting meme tokens falsely associated with DeepSeek, urged users to purchase them. The page also included buttons labeled “CHAT AI” and “PIC AI,” which seemed genuine but instead directed users to fraudulent Telegram bots. The bots then interacted with users, tried to steal their credentials, or tricked them into investing in bogus schemes.\n\n\n\nHow to Protect Yourself and Your Business\nTo avoid falling victim to scams exploiting DeepSeek’s popularity, individuals and organizations should take the following precautions:\n\n\n\nVerify Sources: Always verify the authenticity of websites, emails, and social media accounts claiming to be affiliated with DeepSeek. Check for official domain names, look for spelling errors or inconsistencies, and contact the company directly if you’re unsure.\n\n\n\nAvoid Unofficial Apps and Tools: Only download software or apps from official sources, such as DeepSeek’s website or authorized app stores. Be wary of third-party tools that claim to enhance or integrate with DeepSeek, as these are often fronts for malware.\n\n\n\nEducate Yourself and Others: Share knowledge of these scams with your colleagues, friends, and family. If you run a business, ensure that you run phishing simulations and security awareness programs to boost security alertness and secure practices among employees.\n\n\n\nUse Strong Security Controls: Implement strong passwords, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication, and keep software and devices up to date. Deploy cybersecurity tools that can detect malware and phish emails and websites.\n\n\n\nBe Skeptical of Unrealistic Promises: Be cautious of claims that DeepSeek or any AI technology can deliver guaranteed results or extraordinary returns with minimal effort.\n\n\n\nReport Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a potential scam, report it to relevant authorities, such as your local cybersecurity agency or DeepSeek’s official support team. This can help prevent others from falling victim.\n\n\n\nThe rapid rise of DeepSeek has brought immense potential for innovation and growth, but it has also created opportunities for scammers to exploit the hype. By understanding the techniques used by threat actors and taking proactive steps to protect themselves, organizations can mitigate the risks and continue to benefit from the transformative power of AI.\n\t\t\t\nFake Websites\nResearchers tracked thousands of look-alike domain names and fake websites (around 2,600 websites surfaced between December 1, 2024 and February 3, 2025) impersonating DeepSeek.

Since DeepSeek is privately held with no official plans of going public, these scams aim to steal sensitive user information and commit victims to financial fraud.\n\n\n\nFake Bots And Telegram Channels\nA scam involving a fake bot page promoting meme tokens falsely associated with DeepSeek, urged users to purchase them. The page also included buttons labeled “CHAT AI” and “PIC AI,” which seemed genuine but instead directed users to fraudulent Telegram bots. The bots then interacted with users, tried to steal their credentials, or tricked them into investing in bogus schemes.\n\n\n\nHow to Protect Yourself and Your Business\nTo avoid falling victim to scams exploiting DeepSeek’s popularity, individuals and organizations should take the following precautions:\n\n\n\nVerify Sources: Always verify the authenticity of websites, emails, and social media accounts claiming to be affiliated with DeepSeek. Check for official domain names, look for spelling errors or inconsistencies, and contact the company directly if you’re unsure.\n\n\n\nAvoid Unofficial Apps and Tools: Only download software or apps from official sources, such as DeepSeek’s website or authorized app stores. Be wary of third-party tools that claim to enhance or integrate with DeepSeek, as these are often fronts for malware.\n\n\n\nEducate Yourself and Others: Share knowledge of these scams with your colleagues, friends, and family. If you run a business, ensure that you run phishing simulations and security awareness programs to boost security alertness and secure practices among employees.\n\n\n\nUse Strong Security Controls: Implement strong passwords, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication, and keep software and devices up to date. Deploy cybersecurity tools that can detect malware and phish emails and websites.\n\n\n\nBe Skeptical of Unrealistic Promises: Be cautious of claims that DeepSeek or any AI technology can deliver guaranteed results or extraordinary returns with minimal effort.\n\n\n\nReport Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a potential scam, report it to relevant authorities, such as your local cybersecurity agency or DeepSeek’s official support team. This can help prevent others from falling victim.\n\n\n\nThe rapid rise of DeepSeek has brought immense potential for innovation and growth, but it has also created opportunities for scammers to exploit the hype. By understanding the techniques used by threat actors and taking proactive steps to protect themselves, organizations can mitigate the risks and continue to benefit from the transformative power of AI.\n\t\t\t\nFake Developer Tools\nThreat actors uploaded two malicious Python packages—”deepseeek” and “deepseekai”—to the Python Package Index (PyPI), a widely used repository for Python software. These packages, masquerading as developer tools for DeepSeek, were designed to steal sensitive user and system data, including API keys, database credentials, and access tokens. The stolen information was exfiltrated to a command-and-control server using Pipedream, a legitimate automation platform. When these malicious packages were discovered, researchers reported them to PyPI, which then promptly removed them. However, by then, 222 developers, primarily from the U.S. and China, had already downloaded them.\n\n\n\nFake Social Media Accounts\nDeepSeek has reported that it is battling a barrage of fake social media accounts. In a recent public statement, they stated discovering numerous fake accounts impersonating DeepSeek on social media, spreading misinformation and scams, misleading users into believing they were engaging with the authentic company. DeepSeek clarified that it operates only three official accounts – on WeChat, X, and Chinese social media app, RedNote  – warning users of imposters charging fees or promoting bogus cryptocurrencies. DeepSeek also alerted users of a fraudulent account on X impersonating its founder, Liang Wenfeng.\n\n\n\nFake Investment and Cryptocurrency SchemesAdvertisement.

The utility had been in the process of implementing Dragos operational technology (OT) security solutions when the intrusion was detected, which led to an expedited deployment.\n\n\n\nThe case study published by Dragos focuses on the benefits of its solutions, including how they can be used to detect such intrusions and protect OT organizations against threats. \n\n\n\nHowever, the industrial cybersecurity firm has shared some additional details with SecurityWeek. \n\n\n\nDragos said the LELWD breach was discovered in November 2023, just before Thanksgiving, and an investigation showed that the hackers had been in the organization’s network since February 2023, for more than 300 days. \n\n\n\nThe existence of Volt Typhoon came to light in May 2023, when Microsoft reported that the group, which the tech giant linked to the Chinese government, had been targeting US critical infrastructure in espionage operations. The threat actor has since made many headlines due to its sophistication, its botnets, and its use of zero-days.\n\n\n\nDragos reported one year ago that Volt Typhoon, which the company tracks as Voltzite, had been collecting sensitive OT data from hacked organizations. The security firm warned that while it had not been observed hacking ICS and causing disruption, Volt Typhoon could pose a serious threat to such systems.\n\n\n\nIn the case of the LELWD power utility, the hackers were seen collecting data on OT systems, Dragos told SecurityWeek. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“The significance of the discovery of this attack is that it highlights that the adversary not only aimed to maintain persistent access to the victim’s environment for a long tenure, but also were aiming to exfiltrate specific data related to OT operating procedures and spatial layout data relating to energy grid operations,” Dragos said. \n\n\n\n“This information can be pivotal for helping the adversary know exactly where to attack when, or if, they decide to utilize a Stage 2 capability in the future,” it added. \n\n\n\nStage 2 in the ICS Cyber Kill Chain means that hackers can develop and test specific and meaningful attacks on industrial control systems. Volt Typhoon is one of the several active threat groups tracked by Dragos that have such capabilities. \n\n\n\nDragos also told SecurityWeek that Volt Typhoon was in many cases — outside of the LELWD hack — observed exfiltrating geographic information system (GIS) data containing critical information about the spatial layout of energy systems. \n\n\n\n“Exfiltrated data and persistent access to OT systems could be employed as a means for actions on objectives in the future,” the security firm explained. \n\n\n\nLearn More at SecurityWeek’s ICS Cybersecurity ConferenceThe leading global conference series for Operations, Control Systems and OT/IT Security professionals to connect on SCADA, DCS PLC and field controller cybersecurity.October 27-30, 2025 | Atlantawww.icscybersecurityconference.com\nRelated: Nine Threat Groups Active in OT Operations in 2024\nRelated: Organizations Still Not Patching OT Due to Disruption Concerns\nRelated: Details Disclosed for SCADA Flaws That Could Facilitate Industrial Attacks\n\nThe target was Littleton Electric Light and Water Departments (LELWD), a small public power utility in Massachusetts that serves Littleton and Boxborough.
