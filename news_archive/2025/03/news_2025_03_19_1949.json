It's also consistent with\nhistorical\nobservations\nabout how cryptjacking attacks are known to terminate rival miner processes prior to deploying their own payloads.\nThe development comes shortly after Cisco Talos\nrevealed\ndetails of a campaign weaponizing the PHP flaw in attacks targeting Japanese organizations since the start of the year.\nUsers are advised to update their PHP installations to the latest version to safeguard against potential threats.\n\"Since most campaigns have been using LOTL tools, organizations should consider limiting the use of tools such as PowerShell within the environment to only privileged users such as administrators,\" Zugec said.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The threat actors behind the\nClearFake\ncampaign are using fake reCAPTCHA or Cloudflare Turnstile verifications as lures to trick users into downloading malware such as Lumma Stealer and Vidar Stealer.\nClearFake\n, first highlighted in July 2023, is the name given to a threat activity cluster that employs\nfake web browser update baits\non compromised WordPress as a malware distribution vector.\nThe campaign is also known for relying on another technique known as\nEtherHiding\nto fetch the next-stage payload by utilizing Binance's Smart Chain (BSC) contracts as a way to make the attack chain more resilient. The end goal of these infection chains is to deliver information-stealing malware capable of targeting both Windows and macOS systems.\nAs of May 2024, ClearFake attacks have adopted what has by now come to be known as\nClickFix\n, a\nsocial engineering ploy\nthat involves deceiving users into running malicious PowerShell code under the guise of addressing a non-existent technical issue.\n\"Although this new ClearFake variant continues to rely on the EtherHiding technique and the ClickFix tactic, it has introduced additional interactions with the Binance Smart Chain,\" Sekoia\nsaid\nin a new analysis.\n\"By using smart contract's Application Binary Interfaces, these interactions involve loading multiple JavaScript codes and additional resources that fingerprint the victim's system, as well as downloading, decrypting and displaying the ClickFix lure.\"\nThe latest iteration of the ClearFake framework marks a significant evolution, adopting Web3 capabilities to resist analysis and encrypting the ClickFix-related HTML code.\nThe net result is an updated multi-stage attack sequence that's initiated when a victim visits a compromised site, which then leads to the retrieval of an intermediate JavaScript code from BSC. The loaded JavaScript is subsequently responsible for fingerprinting the system and fetching the encrypted ClickFix code hosted on Cloudflare Pages.\nShould the victim follow through and execute the malicious PowerShell command, it leads to the deployment of\nEmmenhtal Loader\n(aka PEAKLIGHT) that subsequently drops Lumma Stealer.\nSekoia said it observed an alternate ClearFake attack chain in late January 2025 that served a PowerShell loader responsible for installing Vidar Stealer. As of last month, at least 9,300 websites have been infected with ClearFake.\n\"The operator has consistently updated the framework code, lures, and distributed payloads on a daily basis,\" it added. \"ClearFake execution now relies on multiple pieces of data stored in the Binance Smart Chain, including JavaScript code, AES key, URLs hosting lure HTML files, and ClickFix PowerShell commands.\"\n\"The number of websites compromised by ClearFake suggest that this threat remains widespread and affects many users worldwide. In July 2024, [...] approximately 200,000 unique users were potentially exposed to ClearFake lures encouraging them to download malware.\"\nThe development comes as over 100 auto dealership sites have been discovered compromised with\nClickFix lures\nthat lead to the deployment of\nSectopRAT\nmalware.\n\"Where this infection on the auto dealerships happened was not on the dealership's own website, but a third-party video service,\"\nsaid\nsecurity researcher Randy McEoin, who detailed some of the earliest\nClearFake campaigns\nin 2023, describing the incident as an instance of a supply chain attack.\nThe video service in question is LES Automotive (\"idostream[.]com\"), which has since removed the malicious JavaScript injection from the site.\nThe findings also coincide with the discovery of several phishing campaigns that are engineered to push various malware families and conduct credential harvesting -\nUsing\nvirtual hard disk (VHD) files\nembedded within archive file attachments in email messages to distribute\nVenom RAT\nby means of a Windows batch script\nUsing\nMicrosoft Excel file attachments\nthat exploit a known security flaw (\nCVE-2017-0199\n) to download an HTML Application (HTA) that then uses Visual Basic Script (VBS) to fetch an image, which contains another payload responsible for decoding and launching AsyncRAT and Remcos RAT\nExploiting\nmisconfigurations in Microsoft 365 infrastructure\nto take control of tenants, create new administrative accounts, and deliver phishing content that bypasses email security protections and ultimately facilitates credential harvesting and account takeover (ATO)\nAs social engineering campaigns continue to become more sophisticated, it's essential that organizations and businesses stay ahead of the curve and implement robust authentication and access-control mechanisms against Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) and Browser-in-the-Middle (BitM) techniques that allow attackers to hijack accounts.\n\"A pivotal benefit of employing a BitM framework lies in its rapid targeting capability, allowing it to reach any website on the web in a matter of seconds and with minimal configuration,\" Google-owned Mandiant\nsaid\nin a report published this week.\n\"Once an application is targeted through a BitM tool or framework, the legitimate site is served through an attacker-controlled browser. This makes the distinction between a legitimate and a fake site exceptionally challenging for a victim. From the perspective of an adversary, BitM allows for a simple yet effective means of stealing sessions protected by MFA.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Identity-based attacks are on the rise. Attackers are targeting identities with compromised credentials, hijacked authentication methods, and misused privileges. While many threat detection solutions focus on cloud, endpoint, and network threats, they overlook the unique risks posed by SaaS identity ecosystems. This blind spot is wreaking havoc on heavily SaaS-reliant organizations big and small.\nThe question is, what can security teams do about it?\nHave no fear, because\nIdentity Threat Detection and Response\n(ITDR) is here to save the day. It's essential to have the visibility and response mechanisms to stop attacks before they become breaches.\nHere's the super lineup that every team needs to stop SaaS identity threats.\n#1 Full coverage: cover every angle\nLike Cap's shield, this defense should cover every angle. Traditional threat detection tools such as XDRs and EDRs fail to cover SaaS applications and leave organizations vulnerable. SaaS identity threat detection and response (ITDR) coverage should include:\nITDR should extend beyond traditional cloud, network, IoT, and endpoint security to include SaaS applications like Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Jira, and Github.\nSeamless integrations with IdPs like Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace to make sure no logins slip through the cracks.\nDeep forensic investigation of events and audit logs for a detailed report of logging and historical analysis of all identity-related incidents.\n#2 Identity-centric: let no one slip through the threads\nSpidey's web ensnares enemies before they strike, and no one slips through the threads. When security events are only listed in chronological order, abnormal activity by a single identity can go undetected. It's crucial to make sure your ITDR detects and correlates threats in an identity-centric timeline.\nWhat identity-centric in ITDR means:\nYou can see the complete attack story by one identity across your entire SaaS environment, mapping lateral movements from infiltration to exfiltration.\nAuthentication events, privilege changes, and access anomalies are structured into attack chains.\nUser and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) are leveraged to identify deviations from normal identity activity so you don't have to hunt through events to find the suspicious ones.\nBoth human and non-human identities like service accounts, API keys, and OAuth tokens are continuously monitored and flagged for abnormal activity.\nUnusual privilege escalations or lateral movement attempts within your SaaS environments are detected so you can investigate and respond rapidly.\n#3 Threat intelligence: detect the undetectable\nProfessor X can see everything with Cerebro, and complete ITDR should be able to detect the undetectable. ITDR threat intelligence should:\nClassify any darknet activity for easy investigation by security teams.\nInclude IP geolocation and IP privacy (VPNs) for context.\nEnrich threat detection with Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) like compromised credentials, malicious IPs, and other suspicious markers.\nMap attack stages using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to help identify identity compromise and lateral movement.\n#4 Prioritization: focus on the real threats\nAlert fatigue is real. Daredevil's heightened senses allow him to filter through overwhelming noise, detect hidden dangers, and focus on the real threats—just like ITDR prioritization cuts through alert fatigue and highlights critical risks. SaaS ITDR threat prioritization should include:\nDynamic risk scoring in real-time to reduce false positives and highlight the most critical threats.\nA complete incident timeline that connects identity events into a cohesive attack story, turning scattered signals into high-fidelity, actionable alerts.\nClear alert context with affected identities, impacted applications, attack stage in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and key event details like failed logins, privilege escalation, and behavioral anomalies.\n#5 Integrations: Be unstoppable\nJust like the Avengers combine their powers to be unstoppable, an effective SaaS ITDR should have integrations for automated workflows, making the team more efficient and reducing heavy lifting. ITDR integrations should include:\nSIEM & SOAR for automated workflows.\nStep-by-step mitigation playbooks and policy enforcement guides for every application and every stage of the MITRE ATT&CK framework\n#6 Posture management: Leverage the dynamic duo (BONUS TIP!)\nBlack Widow and Hawkeye are a dynamic duo, and a comprehensive ITDR relies on SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) to minimize the attack surface as the first layer of protection. A complimentary SSPM should include:\nDeep visibility into all SaaS applications, including Shadow IT, app-to-app integrations, user permissions, roles, and access levels.\nMisconfiguration & policy drift detection, aligned to the SCuBA framework by CISA, to identify misconfigured authentication policies like lack of MFA, weak password policies, and excessive role-based permissions to ensure policies are consistently enforced\nDormant and orphaned account detection to flag inactive, unused, or orphaned accounts that pose a risk.\nTracking of user lifecycle events to prevent unauthorized access.\nWith great power comes great responsibility\nThis lineup of must-haves fully equips organizations to face any SaaS identity-based threat that comes their way. Not all heroes wear capes… some just have unstoppable ITDR.\nLearn more about Wing Security's SaaS identity threat detection and response\nhere\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

But the compromise is said to have occurred on March 11, 2025. The breach of tj-actions/changed-files happened at some point before March 14.\nThis means that the infected reviewdog action could be used to insert malicious code into any CI/CD workflows using it, in this case a Base64-encoded payload that's appended to a file named install.sh used by the workflow.\nLike in the case of tj-actions, the payload is designed to expose secrets from repositories running the workflow in logs. The issue impacts only one tag (v1) of reviewdog/action-setup.\nThe maintainers of tj-actions have disclosed that the attack was the result of a compromised Github Personal Access Token (PAT) that enabled the attackers to modify the repository with unauthorized code.\n\"We can tell the attacker gained sufficient access to update the v1 tag to the malicious code they had placed on a fork of the repository,\" McCarthy said.\n\"The reviewdog Github Organization has a relatively large contributor base and appears to be actively adding contributors through automated invites. This increases the attack surface for a contributor's access to have been compromised or contributor access to have been gained maliciously.\"\nIn light of the compromise, affected users and federal agencies are advised to update to the latest version of tj-actions/changed-files (46.0.1) by April 4, 2025, to secure their networks against active threats. But given the root cause, there is a risk of re-occurrence.\nBesides replacing the affected actions with safer alternatives, it's advised to audit past workflows for suspicious activity, rotate any leaked secrets, and pin all GitHub Actions to specific commit hashes instead of version tags.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Most organizations today have invested in an email security solution of some description. But even the most premium tools have significant limitations when it comes to modern phishing attacks.\nThe data speaks for itself — phishing remains as big a problem as it ever was (if not bigger!) despite enormous investment in security products and training. In 2024, identity-based attack vectors involving a human element (phishing and stolen credentials) accounted for 80% of the initial access observed by\nVerizon\n, while 69% of organizations experienced a phishing incident in 2024 according to\nIDSA\n.\nIDSA Digital Identities Report 2024\nSource: IDSA\nSo, why are phishing attacks still so effective for attackers?\nModern phishing attacks are evading established controls\nLet’s start with the lay of the land: What controls and capabilities do organizations typically rely on when it comes to blocking credential phishing?\nIf you’re using an email security solution, you’re relying on the following core capabilities when it comes to detecting malicious phishing pages:\nKnown-bad blocklists:\nBlock users from accessing known-bad or unapproved domains/URLs, and block traffic from known-bad malicious IPs, using Threat Intelligence (TI) feeds.\nMalicious webpage detection:\nInspect webpages by loading them in a sandbox to detect malicious elements.\nThis also applies to other solutions that rely on these capabilities, such as web-based content filtering (e.g. Google Safe Browsing), CASB, SASE, SWG, etc.\nBut, attackers are now using specific tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs) and tooling designed to defeat these solutions.\nLet’s look at where these controls are falling short.\nAttackers are innovating with new tooling and techniques\nThe vast majority of phishing attacks today are executed using\nAitM phishing kits — otherwise known as “MFA bypass” kits\n.\nThese kits use dedicated tooling to act as a proxy between the target and a legitimate login portal for an application. This allows the target to log in successfully with a legitimate service they use and even continue to interact with it.\nAs it’s a proxy to the real application, the page will appear exactly as the user expects, because they are logging into the legitimate site – just taking a detour via the attacker’s device.\nHowever, because the attacker is sitting in the middle of this connection, they are able to observe all interactions, intercept authentication material like credentials, MFA codes, and session tokens to take control of the authenticated session and gain control of the user account.\nEvilginx being used to take over an M365 account\nSource: Push Security\nMFA was once widely regarded as the silver bullet for phishing (we all remember the Microsoft stat “MFA prevents over 99% of identity-based attacks”) but this is no longer the case.\nNot only are these kits incredibly effective at bypassing other anti-phishing controls like MFA, attackers are building them specifically to evade common detection tooling and techniques.\nProtect and defend your identity attack surface with Push Security\nBook a demo to see how Push's browser-based identity security platform prevents account takeover attacks like MFA-bypass phishing, credential stuffing, password spraying, and session hijacking.\nFind, fix, and defend workforce identities where they're created and used — in employee browsers.\nBook a demo or try it for free\nKnown-bad blocklists can’t keep up\nThe fundamental limitation with known-bad blocklists is that they focus on indicators that are easy for attackers to change, in turn making detections based on them easy to bypass.\nAttackers have gotten pretty good at disguising and rotating these elements. In modern phishing attacks, every target can receive a unique email and link. Even just using a URL shortener can bypass this. It’s equivalent to a malware hash – trivial to change, and therefore not a great thing to pin your detections on. The kind of detection that sits right at the bottom of the Pyramid of Pain.\nYou could look at which IP address the user connects to, but these days it’s very simple for attackers to add a new IP to their cloud-hosted server. If a domain is flagged as known-bad, the attacker only has to register a new domain, or compromise a WordPress server on an already trusted domain.\nBoth of these things are happening on a massive scale as attackers pre-plan for the fact that their domains will be burned at some point. Attackers are more than happy to spend $10-$20 per new domain in the grand scheme of the potential proceeds of crime.\nFor example,\nrecent examples of Adversary-in-the-Middle phishing kits\nincluding Tycoon, Nakedpages, Evilginx were seen to rotate the URLs they resolve to (from a continually refreshed pool of URLs), mask the HTTP Referer header to disguise suspicious redirects, and redirect to benign (legitimate) domains if anyone but the intended victims attempted to visit the page.\nAnd in many cases, attackers are\nleveraging legitimate SaaS services\nto conduct their campaigns (\nsometimes even using email protection services themselves!\n) making it even harder to filter genuine from harmful links.\nBut there’s a bigger issue here – for defenders to know that a URL, IP, or domain name is bad, it needs to be reported first. When are things reported? Typically after being used in an attack — so unfortunately, someone always gets hurt.\nMalicious webpage detections are failing\nAttackers are using various tricks to prevent security tools and bots from reaching their phishing pages to analyse them.\nUsing legitimate services to host their domains is increasingly common, with services like Cloudflare Workers used for the initial gateway, and Cloudflare Turnstile to prevent security bots from advancing to the page.\nEven if you can get past Turnstile, then you’ll need to supply the correct URL parameters and headers, and execute JavaScript, to be served the malicious page. This means that a defender who knows the domain name can’t discover the malicious behavior just by making a simple HTTP(S) request to the domain.\nAnd if all this wasn’t enough, they’re also obfuscating both visual and DOM elements to prevent signature-based detections from picking them up — so even if you can land on the page, there’s a high chance that your detections won’t trigger.\nBy changing the DOM structure, attackers are loading functionally equivalent pages that look very different under the hood.\nComparing a legitimate page’s DOM structure with an attacker’s cloned page\nSource: Push Security\nThey’re also randomizing page titles, dynamically decoding text, changing the size and name of image elements, using different favicons, blurring backgrounds, substituting logos, and more… all to defeat common detections.\nThe left image is a fake login page — looks pretty believable though, right?\nSource: Push Security\nWith all this, it’s no surprise that defenders can’t keep up.\nThe verdict\nHistorically, the industry has seen email security solutions and anti-phishing as the same thing. But it’s clear that email-based phishing protection isn’t really cutting it when it comes to modern credential phishing attacks (the most common and impactful phishing variant today).\nThis isn’t to say that email-based solutions have no value — far from it. But relying on email scanners to detect phishing pages as a single line of defense isn’t enough anymore.\nBuilding better phishing controls\nThe key to solving this problem is, put simply, building better controls. But to do this, we need to move away from email as being the primary (or often the only) place where phishing attacks can be stopped.\nWhile email is the main delivery vector for phishing attacks (at least, according to the data we have, which comes primarily from email security solutions) it’s not the only one. Phishing links are increasingly delivered to victims over IM platforms, social media — and generally over the internet.\nA better solution to the problem would therefore be able to follow the user across the sites they use, and see the actual phishing pages as the user sees them, as opposed to a sandbox (which, as we’ve discussed, attackers are well prepared for).\nIs browser-based phishing protection the solution?\nWhile we’ve been conditioned to think about phishing as something that happens over email, it’s actually the browser where most of the action happens, regardless of the initial delivery channel.\nAnd while it’s tempting to view the delivery of a phishing link as the attack itself, the phish can’t succeed unless the victim enters their genuine credentials on the malicious page.\nPush Security\nprovides a browser-based identity security solution that stops phishing attacks where they happen — in employee browsers.\nBeing in the browser delivers a lot of advantages when it comes to detecting and intercepting phishing attacks. You see the live webpage that the user sees, meaning you have much better visibility of malicious elements running on the page. It also means that you can implement real-time controls that kick in when a malicious element is detected.\nThere’s a clear difference when you compare a phishing attack with and without Push.\nHere, an attacker hacks a WordPress blog to get a reputable domain and then runs a phishing toolkit on the webpage. They email one of your employees a link to it. Your SWG or email scanning solution inspects it in a sandbox but the phish kit detects this and redirects to a benign site so that it passes the inspection.\nYour user gets the email with the link and is now free to interact with the phishing page. They enter their credentials plus MFA code into the page and voila! The attacker steals the authenticated session and takes over the user’s account.\nBut with Push, the Push browser extension inspects the webpage running in the user's browser. Push observes that the webpage is a login page and the user is entering their password into the page, detecting that:\nThe password the user is entering matches the domain that password is pinned to. Since it doesn't match, based on this detection alone the user is automatically redirected to a blocking page.\nThe rendered web app is using a cloned app login page.\nA phishing toolkit is running on the web page.\nAs a result, the user is blocked from interacting with the phishing site and prevented from continuing.\nThese are good examples of detections that are difficult (or impossible) for an attacker to evade —\nyou can’t phish a victim if they can’t enter their credentials into your phishing site!\nIf we look at the Pyramid of Pain again, we can see that these are much harder detections for attackers to get around,\nenabling earlier detection and interception of account takeover\nwhen compared to static, TI-driven blocklists — stopping attacks before anyone gets hurt.\nApplying the Pyramid of Pain to identity-based attacks\nSource: Push Security\nTest it out for yourself\nYou can try some of our anti-phishing controls for free.\nSign up by hitting the ‘login’ button and creating a free account\n.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nOrion protects against data exfiltration by using AI to compare actual data flows against permitted and expected data flows.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nOrion Security has emerged from stealth with a $6 million seed funding round led by Pico Partners and FXP, with participation from Underscore VC and cybersecurity leaders. Based in Tel Aviv, Israel, the firm was founded in 2024 by Nitay Milner (CEO) and Yonatan Kreiner (CTO) with a mission to use AI to revitalize data leak prevention (DLP).\n\n\n\nOrion’s platform automatically learns and understands how data normally flows within an organization. “By using AI to map and understand an organization’s operational DNA, we’re enabling a new generation of data protection that can accurately distinguish between legitimate business workflows and potential data theft, without burdening an already overstretched security team,” explains Milner.\n\n\n\nOrion uses two primary AI models. The first uses multiple LLMs to understand and classify company data: is it PCI traffic, is it unstructured IP, is it PII or PHI with SSNs or private addresses. “The second,” says Milner, “is a reasoning model. It helps you understand the entire context around a data incident. Who sent this data outside? What department does he work for? Where did this data go? What is this data containing? It basically considers all the criteria around an incident to be able to decide whether it was a genuine incident or just a legitimate business flow inside the company.”\n\n\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it will instantly detect the first attempt at low and slow data exfiltration by an insider (or, indeed, an attacker) and draw the security team’s attention to the incident –- or stop it.\n\n\n\n“The three primary use cases we look at,” says Milner, “are human error, the insider threat, and attackers who have got into the system and are now trying to exfiltrate data. The insider threat is our current focus. It could be a disgruntled employee, it could be a curious employee who wants information, such as payroll information, that he or she should not see; or it could be a North Korean agent who has gained employment but is really after company IP.”\n\n\n\nThe third use case is interesting. Since the platform’s first attention is to the flow of data, followed by an instant determination on the legitimacy of the flow (that is, should that person be doing this with such data at this time?), the potential of the solution has further possibilities. For example, attempts at large scale data exfiltration could indicate the presence of an undetected attacker. It could, in fact, be the pre-encryption data theft stage of double extortion ransomware — which it could detect and stop.\n\n\n\nMilner recognizes this. While stressing that the platform is currently designed for the insider threat, he told SecurityWeek, ‘We are looking at the wider ransomware threat and what we could do about it. It’s part of our vision for the future and the next use cases we can include in the platform.”\n\n\n\nThis platform uses the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize the current approach to DLP. Instead of relying on manual policies to prevent data leaks, the platform monitors the data, relates it to the company’s DNA, and stops (or reports) illegitimate data movement. In this sense it automates the whole process of DLP policy creation and enforcement. Manual policies are never enough. They are expensive in manpower, always lag behind reality, and generate too many false positive alerts. There are new applications and new workflows every day – and they all require new policies.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nOrion eliminates reliance on this. By first understanding the company at a very deep level, it can concentrate on protecting the data in real time without waiting for manual policies that may not yet exist. Its purpose is to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of data leak prevention.\n\n\n\nA separate report from DLP firm MIND published on March 18, 2025, reveals the failure of traditional methods. Fifty-three percent of participants in a survey reported two or more unstructured data leaks in the last 12 months. Alert fatigue is real: 92% deferred inspection for more than 24 hours; and 47% of alerts inspected within 24 hours are false positives. \n\n\n\nRelated: Mandiant Offers Clues to Spotting and Stopping North Korean Fake IT Workers\nRelated: VirusTotal Provides Clarifications on Data Leak Affecting Premium Accounts\nRelated: Data Loss Prevention Startup MIND Emerges From Stealth With $11M in Funding\nRelated: New CCA Jailbreak Method Works Against Most AI Models\n\nOrion’s platform automatically learns and understands how data normally flows within an organization. “By using AI to map and understand an organization’s operational DNA, we’re enabling a new generation of data protection that can accurately distinguish between legitimate business workflows and potential data theft, without burdening an already overstretched security team,” explains Milner.\n\n\n\nOrion uses two primary AI models.

While stressing that the platform is currently designed for the insider threat, he told SecurityWeek, ‘We are looking at the wider ransomware threat and what we could do about it. It’s part of our vision for the future and the next use cases we can include in the platform.”\n\n\n\nThis platform uses the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize the current approach to DLP. Instead of relying on manual policies to prevent data leaks, the platform monitors the data, relates it to the company’s DNA, and stops (or reports) illegitimate data movement. In this sense it automates the whole process of DLP policy creation and enforcement. Manual policies are never enough.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nDefending high profile sporting events from adversarial attacks requires a mix of experienced capabilities and a solid threat intelligence program.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nWith the Super Bowl and NBA All-Star weekend behind us this means March Madness is nearly upon us. I’m sure most of us know about March Madness, which is the nickname for the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s (NCAA) Division I men’s and women’s college basketball tournaments.\nEmotions run high around this tournament, as millions of people across America fill out March Madness “brackets” with the hope of predicting the Final Four as 67 games are played over a 3-week period in March and April. I’m a life-long March Madness fan and I absolutely understand the excitement it generates. I even did my college Honors paper on inter-collegiate athletics (men’s football and basketball), how their teams performed, how far they got in tournaments and how that correlated with alumni contributions to the school. I won’t bore you with the findings here, but you won’t be surprised that money flowed in based on results relative to expectations; such is the very personal connection that sporting success generates.   \n\n\n\nWhy March Madness ticket sales are targeted \nHowever, fast forward to the present day and what we find is that, like many other major sporting events, the excitement and enormous interest doesn’t just stop with fans and businesses, but it is also on the radar of many threat actors. Ticket sales for these games represent prime pickings and provide the perfect opportunity for adversaries because they are:\n\n\n\n\nHigh value – Tickets are expensive, and it is not unusual for fans to buy groups of tickets to go to events together.  Therefore, it doesn’t raise suspicion when a high-dollar figure purchase is made by a threat actor.\nControlled through official channels – Meaning fans who don’t want to purchase the ‘Official Ticketmaster NCAA Experience Package” are incentivised to look elsewhere for tickets, which gives fraudsters the perfect opportunity for scams.\nTime-critical – Fans rush to buy tickets last-minute as teams go through to the next round. This urgency creates chaos and makes it easier for adversaries to hide in plain sight.\nAn emotional purchase – As already mentioned, emotions run high, meaning that some of the standard security protocols and learnings about security go out the window in the rush to get many sought-after tickets.\n\nAll the above means that pressure on security teams intensifies as they struggle to keep pace, especially when so many purchases happen in a flood once the brackets are set and then when results are known.\n\n\n\nAttacks are becoming more sophisticated\nDefending the Super Bowl and other high profile sporting events from adversarial attacks that potentially include weaponized AI, endpoint attacks, deepfakes, and finely tuned social engineering skills requires a mix of experienced capabilities and a solid threat intelligence program. Just taking Super Bowl Sunday as an example, this saw a 57% rise in malicious gambling and betting content. There was also a 15% increase in illegal streaming and torrenting traffic related to fake streaming sites during the championship weekend compared to the previous average held between May and December, indicating an escalating risk of security issues tied to these big events.\n\n\n\nAnother example is the Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics. The SOC team recognized how important it is to really understand the threat landscape and what you can expect in terms of threats and attacks. There will of course be some known paths for hackers to exploit, but there will also be areas that are unknown or unexpected and this is where collective knowledge sharing is so important.\n\n\n\nTo understand potential attack paths, the Olympic SOC team looked at past games to identify who attacked these events and how they did it. Once this analysis had been undertaken, the priority was to determine how the cybersecurity posture and approach might be adapted given this context. This is where arming the team with actionable insights is so important. This includes trying to understand the modus operandi (MO) of the threat actors: who is trying to attack you, do you know their last movements, what facts can you arm the SOC team with to protect against these sorts of attacks?Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nWorking as a collective\nI can’t emphasise enough the importance of sharing this threat intelligence and letting others know what you have found, working as a collective to share intelligence between specific companies. The timings of attacks, and methods, and which part of the tournament do hackers and fraudsters attack most?  It wouldn’t be unreasonable to think that the Final Four is where efforts are targeted, but threat actors and fraudsters don’t attend the matches, they are in it for maximum monetizable ROI, and this starts right from the earliest games where there are many more excited – and therefore vulnerable – fans to target.  Only by sharing intelligence will we uncover their techniques, tactics, motivations and more. This is one of the reasons why we set up our ThreatQ Community, which now boasts more than 500 experienced cyber security professionals sharing intel to level up threat detection and response.\n\n\n\nIt is important to not only be open-minded about where an attack might happen but to also remember there is an individual aspect to this tournament as well as a business aspect. Individuals desperate to get tickets and support their teams might be accessing questionable sites via their corporate devices, potentially exposing the business to malicious activities. \n\n\n\nAs well as being alert and proactive before and during major events, it is equally important to undertake a thorough post-event analysis and assimilate the lessons learned, looking back with a critical eye on what happened.  What were the trends?  What types of attacks did fans, businesses and ticketing companies face? \n\n\n\nBe vigilant\nIt’s hard to recognize some of the risks and scams out there, threat actors are so innovative and creative about increasing their reach and refining the techniques they utilize for attacks. My advice is to be vigilant. Of course, ticketing companies need to be extra thorough during this time, but I would say that we all have a duty as individuals to tell our family and friends if we experience an attack or any form of scam. The more widely we spread the word, the better armed we will all be to recognize that what, on the face of it, looks like a great deal is too good to be true. And remember you can’t afford to be complacent because I guarantee the cybercriminals will be ready to take advantage during March Madness.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotions run high around this tournament, as millions of people across America fill out March Madness “brackets” with the hope of predicting the Final Four as 67 games are played over a 3-week period in March and April.

It also said that the class action lawsuits were consolidated and that the parties agreed to resolve the conflict through mediation.\n\n\n\n“All six actions have since been consolidated, and the consolidated class action complaint was filed on November 7, 2024, purportedly on behalf of all persons residing in the United States whose personally identifiable information was compromised in the incident, including all who were sent a notice of the incident,” the company said.\n\n\n\nLast week, the company notified the SEC and the National Stock Exchange of India that it has reached an agreement with the plaintiffs, and that it would pay $17.5 million as part of the settlement.\n\n\n\n“This proposed agreement would settle all the pending class action lawsuits and resolve all allegations made in this matter,” the company said (PDF).Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThe agreement settles both the class action lawsuits against McCamish and those filed against its customers over the data breach, the company said.\n\n\n\n“The proposed terms are subject to confirmation and due diligence by the plaintiffs, finalization of the terms of the settlement agreement, as well as preliminary and final court approval. Once approved, the settlement will resolve all allegations made in the class action lawsuits without admission of any liability,” McCamish noted.\n\n\n\nRelated: US Military Health Provider HNFS Pays $11M in Settlement Over Cybersecurity Failures\nRelated: In Other News: VPN Supply Chain Attack, PayPal $2M Settlement, RAT Builder Hacks Script Kiddies\nRelated: AT&T to Pay $13 Million in Settlement Over 2023 Data Breach\nRelated: Healthcare Provider to Pay $65M Settlement Following Ransomware Attack\n\nMcCamish, which specializes in insurance solutions, disclosed the incident in November 2023, in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, saying that customer data was compromised in a cyberattack, but refrained from sharing further details.\n\n\n\nIn early 2024, Bank of America and Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company notified tens of thousands of individuals that their personal information was stolen in data breaches related to the cyberattack on McCamish.\n\n\n\nIn an April 2024 update, McCamish said that it had determined with the aid of a third-party e-discovery vendor that approximately 6.5 million individuals were impacted by the incident. \n\n\n\nIn January 2025, McCamish told the SEC that it had “substantially remediated and restored the affected applications and systems” by December 31, 2023.

How does this deal affect startup ecosystem?\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nJust shy of two years after its blockbuster $5.6 billion all-cash acquisition of Mandiant, Google announced another seismic move in the enterprise cybersecurity business with plans to shell out an eye-popping $32 billion to acquire hotshot Israeli startup Wiz.\nThe proposed deal, which comes a year after Wiz walked away from a $23 billion offer, is a high-priced declaration that Google is serious about challenging the entrenched players in enterprise cloud security, reordering the competitive landscape with Microsoft, and reshaping how investors think about funding cloud security startups.\n\n\n\nGoogle has long struggled for relevance in enterprise cybersecurity (despite strong attempts with Chronicle and VirusTotal) but with the addition of Wiz’s technologies alongside Mandiant assets, the company is chasing an ambitious strategy to integrate reactive and proactive security solutions under one roof. \n\n\n\nToday, Google hawks threat intelligence and security operations products under three pillars:\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Threat Intelligence delivers detailed, timely, and actionable threat data so security teams can understand and counter emerging risks.\nGoogle Security Operations aggregates telemetry data to identify high-priority threats and drive automated response through playbook automation and collaboration.\nMandiant Consulting brings incident response expertise and a deep understanding of global attacker behavior, skills honed through handling some of the largest enterprise data breaches.\n\nInto this mix, Google is adding the highly-touted Wiz platform to scan cloud environments across all major clouds to build a comprehensive graph of code, resources, and connections. \n\n\n\nThe Wiz product pinpoints potential attack paths and prioritizes risks based on impact, promising tooling for enterprise developers and security teams to secure applications before deployment. \n\n\n\nIn short, while Google’s existing threat-intel and SOC services react to threats, Wiz is designed to preempt them, offering a seamless, unified security platform that covers every stage of development and operations.\n\n\n\nThe vision is obvious: a unified security platform that protects code, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud infrastructure (across all major clouds) with the power of Google’s AI investments driving everything from threat detection to automated incident response.\n\n\n\nThe Google/Wiz transaction is certainly ruffling feathers at Microsoft. Wiz was founded by ex–Microsoft engineers and made its name by securing Microsoft Azure deployments and exposing gaping security flaws in Redmond’s enterprise cloud code.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nWiz is also a key security partner for Microsoft Azure, integrated deeply through co-selling arrangements and even recognized as a top Marketplace partner. Now that Wiz is part of Google Cloud’s arsenal, Microsoft faces the dual challenge of filling the gap left by Wiz and reinforcing its own cloud security narrative.\n\n\n\nIn a market where multi-cloud strategies are increasingly the norm, Microsoft must ensure that its native offerings can effectively counterbalance the appeal of a Google-backed Wiz that spans all cloud environments.\n\n\n\nThe timing is also crucial, coming on the heels of a scathing CSRB (Cyber Safety Review Board) report that criticized Microsoft’s culture and triggered a major ‘Secure Future Initiative’ overhaul of Redmond’s cybersecurity practices. \n\n\n\nAt the time, Google published a sharp statement warning of “long-standing risk to public-sector organizations using the same vendor for operating systems, email, office software, and security tooling” and called on the government to mitigate risks from a Microsoft-centric monoculture.\n\n\n\nFor venture-backed cloud security startups, particularly those in the DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) space, the Wiz exit at a premium valuation validates the enormous potential in this space.  \n\n\n\nHowever, there’s a darker side: such consolidation could stifle competition by reducing the number of independent players, pushing emerging startups to either align with larger platforms or risk being edged out by giants with near-unlimited resources.\n\n\n\nThe fallout may also extend to venture capital behavior. With the promise of multi-billion-dollar exits, investors might double down on funding the next Wiz-like company. Yet, this trend risks narrowing the field to a few “winners” who ultimately become acquisition targets instead of a healthy ecosystem of independently operating innovators.\n\n\n\nWiz’s decision to sell, rather than navigate through an IPO, is also a strong signal that M&A might be the safer and more lucrative exit strategy for high-growth security startups. The premium Google paid — reportedly a 92% increase over Wiz’s previous valuation — suggests that the next wave of cybersecurity innovation might be locked up in the portfolios of tech giants rather than floating independently on public markets.\n\n\n\nThe implications are significant: fewer IPOs mean less diversity in publicly traded cybersecurity stocks, potentially reducing options for investors seeking to capitalize on the sector’s long-term growth.\n\n\n\nRelated: Google to Acquire Wiz for $32 Billion in Cash\nRelated: Google Debuts Security Products, Hyping Mandiant Expertise\nRelated: Microsoft’s Security Chickens Have Come Home to Roost\nRelated: Google to Acquire Mandiant for $5.4 Billion\nRelated: Microsoft Flexes Security Vendor Muscles With Managed Services\n\nThe proposed deal, which comes a year after Wiz walked away from a $23 billion offer, is a high-priced declaration that Google is serious about challenging the entrenched players in enterprise cloud security, reordering the competitive landscape with Microsoft, and reshaping how investors think about funding cloud security startups.\n\n\n\nGoogle has long struggled for relevance in enterprise cybersecurity (despite strong attempts with Chronicle and VirusTotal) but with the addition of Wiz’s technologies alongside Mandiant assets, the company is chasing an ambitious strategy to integrate reactive and proactive security solutions under one roof. \n\n\n\nToday, Google hawks threat intelligence and security operations products under three pillars:\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Threat Intelligence delivers detailed, timely, and actionable threat data so security teams can understand and counter emerging risks.\nGoogle Security Operations aggregates telemetry data to identify high-priority threats and drive automated response through playbook automation and collaboration.\nMandiant Consulting brings incident response expertise and a deep understanding of global attacker behavior, skills honed through handling some of the largest enterprise data breaches.\n\nInto this mix, Google is adding the highly-touted Wiz platform to scan cloud environments across all major clouds to build a comprehensive graph of code, resources, and connections. \n\n\n\nThe Wiz product pinpoints potential attack paths and prioritizes risks based on impact, promising tooling for enterprise developers and security teams to secure applications before deployment. \n\n\n\nIn short, while Google’s existing threat-intel and SOC services react to threats, Wiz is designed to preempt them, offering a seamless, unified security platform that covers every stage of development and operations.\n\n\n\nThe vision is obvious: a unified security platform that protects code, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud infrastructure (across all major clouds) with the power of Google’s AI investments driving everything from threat detection to automated incident response.\n\n\n\nThe Google/Wiz transaction is certainly ruffling feathers at Microsoft.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nA long-running campaign phishing for credentials through scareware recently switched to targeting macOS users.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nA scareware campaign phishing for login credentials recently switched from targeting Windows to macOS, Israeli cybersecurity firm LayerX reports.\nThroughout 2024 and in early 2025, the attacks targeted Windows users, relying on compromised websites to serve fake Microsoft security alerts claiming that users’ computers had been compromised and locked.\n\n\n\nThe malicious code caused the webpages to freeze, creating the illusion of an issue, and the victim was instructed to provide their Windows username and password, LayerX explains.\n\n\n\nAs part of the campaign, the threat actors hosted their phishing pages on the legitimate Azure application hosting platform Windows.net, adding a sense of legitimacy to the fake prompts.\n\n\n\nThe use of a trusted hosted service for the underlying infrastructure allowed the attackers to bypass anti-phishing defenses that check the reputation of the Top-Level Domain (TLD).\n\n\n\n“In this case, the TLD (windows[.]net) is a well-known and highly-used platform by a reputable provider (Microsoft), with a high TLD reputation score.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nMicrosoft has shared details on StilachiRAT, an evasive and persistent piece of malware that facilitates sensitive data theft.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nMicrosoft this week shared details on StilachiRAT, an evasive and persistent piece of malware that enables cybercriminals to steal sensitive data from compromised systems.\nThe tech giant’s incident response team first spotted StilachiRAT (the name was given by Microsoft) in November 2024. While it currently does not appear to be widely distributed, the company wanted to warn users and organizations.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has yet to link StilachiRAT, which has been described as a remote access trojan (RAT), to any known threat group or a specific country.\n\n\n\nThe company has not specified how the RAT is being distributed, but noted that such threats can be installed through multiple attack vectors, including trojanized software, malicious websites, and email. \n\n\n\nOnce it has been deployed on a device, the malware collects information about the system to enable a detailed profiling. StilachiRAT then scans the system for configuration data associated with 20 different cryptocurrency wallet Chrome extensions. \n\n\n\nThe RAT extracts usernames and passwords stored in Chrome and continuously monitors clipboard content for valuable information such as credentials and cryptocurrency keys.\n\n\n\nThe malware can also monitor RDP sessions, which could allow the attacker to move laterally within the compromised network. \n\n\n\nAccording to Microsoft, StilachiRAT can execute various commands, including to reboot the system, clear logs, manipulate registry entries, and execute applications. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nFor persistence the malware uses the Windows service control manager and watchdog threads to ensure that it’s restored in case of removal. \n\n\n\nThe RAT also packs anti-forensic and evasion capabilities. \n\n\n\n“StilachiRAT displays anti-forensic behavior by clearing event logs and checking certain system conditions to evade detection. This includes looping checks for analysis tools and sandbox timers that prevent its full activation in virtual environments commonly used for malware analysis,” Microsoft explained.\n\n\n\n“Additionally, Windows API calls are obfuscated in multiple ways and a custom algorithm is used to encode many text strings and values. This significantly slows down analysis time since extrapolating higher level logic and code design becomes a more complex effort,” it added. “The malware employs API-level obfuscation techniques to impede manual analysis, specifically by concealing its use of Windows APIs.”\n\n\n\nRelated: 11 State-Sponsored APTs Exploiting LNK Files for Espionage, Data Theft\nRelated: ClickFix Widely Adopted by Cybercriminals, APT Groups\nRelated: DeepSeek’s Malware-Generation Capabilities Put to Test\n\nThe tech giant’s incident response team first spotted StilachiRAT (the name was given by Microsoft) in November 2024.
