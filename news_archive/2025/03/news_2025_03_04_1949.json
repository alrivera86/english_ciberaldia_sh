The loader ultimately decrypts and runs the BC module.\nTrend Micro said it observed a CACTUS ransomware attack that employed the same modus operandi to deploy BackConnect, but also go beyond it to carry out various post-exploitation actions like lateral movement and data exfiltration. However, efforts to encrypt the victim's network ended in failure.\nThe convergence of tactics assumes special significance in light of the\nrecent Black Basta chat log leaks\nthat laid bare the e-crime gang's\ninner workings and organizational structure\n.\nSpecifically, it has\nemerged\nthat members of the financially motivated crew shared valid credentials, some of which have been sourced from information stealer logs. Some of the other prominent initial access points are Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) portals and VPN endpoints.\n\"Threat actors are using these tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) — vishing, Quick Assist as a remote tool, and BackConnect — to deploy Black Basta ransomware,\" Trend Micro said.\n\"Specifically, there is evidence suggesting that members have transitioned from the Black Basta ransomware group to the CACTUS ransomware group. This conclusion is drawn from the analysis of similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) being utilized by the CACTUS group.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Credential stuffing attacks had a huge impact in 2024,\nfueled by a vicious circle of infostealer infections and data breaches\n. But things could be about to get worse still with Computer-Using Agents, a new kind of AI agent that enables low-cost, low-effort automation of common web tasks — including those frequently performed by attackers.\nStolen credentials: The cyber criminal's weapon of choice in 2024\nStolen credentials were the #1 attacker action in 2023/24\n, and the breach vector for 80% of web app attacks. Not surprising when you consider the fact that billions of leaked credentials are in circulation online, and attackers can pick up the latest drop for as little as $10 on criminal forums.\nThe criminal marketplace for stolen credentials is benefitting from\nthe publicity of high-profile breaches in 2024\nsuch as the attacks on\nSnowflake\ncustomers using credentials found in data breach dumps and compromised credential feeds from infostealer and mass phishing campaigns, resulting in the compromise of 165 customer tenants and hundreds of millions of breached records.\nBut despite 2024 being an unprecedented year in terms of the impact of identity-based attacks, there's still a lot of unfulfilled potential for attackers to realize.\nCredential attack automation — what's changed with the shift to SaaS?\nBrute forcing and credential stuffing are nothing new, and have been a key component of the cyber attacker toolkit for decades. But it's not quite as easy to automatically spray credentials across systems as it once was.\nNo more one-size-fits-all\nRather than a single centralized network with apps and data contained within an infrastructure perimeter, business IT is now formed of hundreds of web-based apps and platforms, creating thousands of identities per organization.\nThis means that identities too are now decentralized and distributed all over the internet, as opposed to being stored solely in identity systems like Active Directory, and implemented using common protocols and mechanisms.\nWhile HTTP(S) is standard, modern web apps are complex and highly customized, with a graphically-driven interface that is different every time. And to make matters worse, modern web apps are specifically designed to prevent malicious automation through bot protections like CAPTCHA.\nSo rather than encountering standard protocols and being able to write a single set of tools to use across any organization/environment e.g. write a DNS scanner once, use a single port scanner like Nmap for the entire internet, write a single script per service (e.g. FTP, SSH, Telnet, etc.) for your password sprayer — custom tool development is instead required for every app that you want to target.\nFinding the needle in the haystack\nNot only are there more environments for attackers to include in the scope of their attack, but there are more credentials to work with.\nThere are around\n15 billion compromised credentials\navailable on the public internet, not including those found only in private channels/feeds. This list is growing all of the time — like\n244M never-before-seen passwords\nand 493M unique website and email address pairs being added to Have I Been Pwned from infostealer logs just last month.\nThis sounds scary, but it's tricky for attackers to harness this data. The vast majority of these credentials are old and invalid.\nA recent review of TI data by Push Security researchers\nfound that fewer than 1% of stolen credentials included in threat intelligence feeds from a multi-vendor data set was actionable —\nin other words, 99% of compromised credentials were false positives.\nBut not all of them are useless — as the Snowflake attacks demonstrated, which successfully leveraged credentials dating back to 2020. So there are clearly treasures waiting to be discovered by attackers.\nAttackers are forced to prioritize\nThe distributed nature of apps and identities, and the low reliability of compromised credential data, means attackers are forced to prioritize — despite a target-rich environment of hundreds of business apps, creating thousands of sprawled identities per organization, because:\nWriting and running custom python scripts for every single app (there are more than 40k SaaS apps on the internet) is not realistic. Even if you did the top 100 or 1000 that would be a significant task and require constant maintenance, while barely scratching the surface of the total opportunity.\nEven when fully scripted and using a botnet to distribute the attack and avoid IP blocking, controls like rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and account lockouts can obstruct mass credential stuffing against a single app. And a concentrated attack on a single site is going to generate significant levels of traffic if you want to get through 15 billion passwords in a reasonable timeframe, so it's very likely to raise the alarm.\nSo attackers tend to target a smaller number of apps, and only look for a direct match in terms of the credentials attempted (e.g. the stolen credential must directly belong to an account on the target app). When they do go after something new, it tends to be concentrated on a specific app/platform (e.g. Snowflake) or looking for a narrower subset of credentials (e.g. credentials clearly associated with edge devices, for more traditional network environments).\nA missed opportunity?\nAs we've established, the situation regarding credential stuffing attacks is already pretty bad despite these limitations. But things could be significantly worse.\nPassword reuse means a single compromised account could turn into many\nIf attackers were able to increase the scale of their attacks to target a broader number of apps (rather than concentrating on a shortlist of high value apps) they could take advantage of all-too-common password reuse. According to\na recent investigation of identity data\n, on average:\n1 in 3 employees reuse passwords\n9% of identities have a reused password AND no MFA\n10% of IdP accounts (used for SSO) have a non-unique password\nWhat does this mean? If a stolen credential is valid, there's a good chance that it can be used to access more than one account, on more than one app (at least).\nPicture the scenario:\nA recent compromised credential leak from infostealer infections or credential phishing campaigns shows that a particular username and password combination is valid on a specific app — let's say Microsoft 365. Now, this account is pretty locked down — not only does it have MFA, but there are conditional access policies in place restricting the IP/location it can be accessed from.\nUsually, this is where the attack would end, and you'd turn your attention to something else. But what if you were able to spray these credentials across every other business app that the user has an account on?\nScaling credential attacks with Computer-Using Agents\nUntil now, the impact of AI on identity attacks has been limited to the use of LLMs for the creation of phishing emails, in AI-assisted malware development, and for social media bots — no doubt significant, but not exactly transformative, and requiring constant human oversight and input.\nBut with the launch of OpenAI Operator, a new kind of \"Computer-Using Agent\", this could be about to change.\nOperator is trained on a specialist dataset and implemented in its own sandboxed browser, meaning it is able to perform common web tasks like a human — seeing and interacting with pages as a human would.\nUnlike other automated solutions, Operator requires no custom implementation or coding to be able to interact with new sites, making it a much more scalable option for attackers looking to target a broad sweep of sites/apps.\nDemo: Using Operator to conduct credential stuffing attacks at-scale\nResearchers at\nPush Security\nput the malicious use-cases of Operator to the test, using it to:\nIdentify which companies have an existing tenant on a list of apps\nAttempt to login to various app tenants with a provided username and password\nImpact summary\nThe results were pretty eye-opening. The operator clearly demonstrated the ability to target a list of apps with compromised credentials and perform in-app actions.\nNow think about this x10, x100, x10,000 …\nThese are not complex tasks. But the value of CUAs Operator is not in tackling complexity, but scale. Imagine a world where you can orchestrate Operator windows via API and get it to execute these actions simultaneously (functionality that exists already for ChatGPT).\nBut this is bigger than Operator — it's about the direction of the technology. OpenAI may implement restrictions — better in-app guardrails, rate limits on the number of concurrent tasks and total usage, etc. But you can guarantee it won't be the only CUA — it's only a matter of time before similar products emerge (maybe even inherently malicious ones) making use of the same technology.\nFinal thoughts\nIt's still early days for CUA tech, but there's a clear indication that an already severe security challenge could be made worse with this particular form of AI-driven automation. While the ability to target a broad set of apps has been previously beyond the scope of traditional automation, it's about to become much more accessible to even low-skilled attackers (think: next gen script kiddies?).\nAnother way to think about it is that it effectively gives a human attacker a fleet of low-level interns who don't\nquite\nknow what they're doing, but can be instructed to perform specific, itemised tasks at scale with only the occasional check in — while you work on other, more complex tasks. So, a bit like a red team manager of AI bots.\nOperator means that attackers can leverage compromised credentials at-scale, take advantage of the vast numbers of vulnerable and misconfigured identities, and convert them into systemic breaches much more easily. In a way, it could make credential stuffing a bit more like it was before the shift to cloud apps — where you could spray thousands of credentials across your targets without needing custom development every time.\nThankfully, no new anti-AI capabilities are required — but it's more important than ever that organizations look to defend their identity attack surface and find and fix identity vulnerabilities before attackers can take advantage of them.\nFind out more\nIf you want to learn more about identity attacks and how to stop them, check out\nPush Security\n— you can\nbook a demo\nor try out their browser-based platform for free.\nAnd if you want to see them demo more malicious use cases of Operator,\ncheck out this on-demand webinar.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

The enterprise security firm is tracking the emerging cluster under the moniker\nUNK_CraftyCamel\n.\nA noteworthy aspect of the attack chain is the fact that the adversary took advantage of its access to a compromised email account belonging to the Indian electronics company INDIC Electronics to send phishing messages. The entity is said to have been in a trusted business relationship with all the targets, with the lures tailored to each of them.\n\"UNK_CraftyCamel leveraged a compromised Indian electronics company to target fewer than five organizations in the United Arab Emirates with a malicious ZIP file that leveraged multiple\npolyglot files\nto eventually install a custom Go backdoor dubbed Sosano,\" Proofpoint said in a\nreport\nshared with The Hacker News.\nThe emails contained URLs that pointed to a bogus domain masquerading as the Indian company (\"indicelectronics[.]net\"), hosting a ZIP archive that included an XLS file and two PDF files.\nBut in reality, the XLS file was a Windows shortcut (LNK) using a double extension to pass off as a Microsoft Excel document. The two PDF files, on the other hand, turned out to be polyglots: one that was appended with an HTML Application (HTA) file and the other with a ZIP archive appended to it.\nThis also meant that both PDF files could be interpreted as two different valid formats depending on how they are parsed using programs like file explorers, command-line tools, and browsers.\nThe attack sequence analyzed by Proofpoint entails using the LNK file to launch cmd.exe and then using mshta.exe to run the PDF/HTA polyglot file, leading to the execution of the HTA script that, in turn, contains instructions to unpack the contents of the ZIP archive present within the second PDF.\nOne of the files in the second PDF is an internet shortcut (URL) file that's responsible for loading a binary, which subsequently looks for an image file that's ultimately\nXORed\nwith the string \"234567890abcdef\" to decode and run the DLL backdoor called Sosano.\nWritten in Golang, the implant carries a limited functionality to establish contact with a command-and-control (C2) server and await further commands -\nsosano\n, to get current directory or change working directory\nyangom\n, to enumerate the contents of the current directory\nmonday\n, to download and launch an unknown next-stage payload\nraian\n, to delete or remove a directory\nlunna\n, to execute a shell command\nProofpoint noted that the tradecraft demonstrated by UNK_CraftyCamel does not overlap with any other known threat actor or group.\n\"Our analysis suggests that this campaign is likely the work of an Iranian-aligned adversary, possibly affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),\" Joshua Miller, APT Staff Threat Researcher at Proofpoint, told The Hacker News. \"The targeted sectors are crucial for both economic stability and national security, making them valuable intelligence targets in the broader geopolitical landscape.\"\n\"This low volume, highly targeted phishing campaign leveraged multiple obfuscation techniques along with a trusted third-party compromise to target aviation, satellite communications, and critical transportation infrastructure in the U.A.E.

Further\nresearch by Walmart\nindicated that Zloader was dropping a new proxy malware called BackConnect that contained code references to the Qbot (QakBot) malware.\nBackConnect is malware that acts as a proxy tool for remote access to compromised servers. BackConnect allows cybercriminals to tunnel traffic, obfuscate their activities, and escalate attacks within a victim's environment without being detected.\nBoth Zloader, Qbot, and BackConnect are all believed to be linked to the Black Basta ransomware operation, with members utilizing the malware to breach and spread through corporate networks.\nThese ties are further strengthened by a recent\nBlackBasta data leak\nthat exposed the operation's internal conversations, including those between the ransomware gang's manager and someone believed to be the developer of Qbot.\nThe links\nBlack Basta is a ransomware gang that\nlaunched in April 2022\n. It is believed to include members of the Conti Ransomware gang, which\nshut down in May 2022\nafter suffering a\nmassive data leak\nof source code and internal conversations.\nThe ransomware gang has historically\nused Qakbot to gain initial access\nto corporate networks. However, after a\n2023 law enforcement operation\ndisrupted Qbot's operations, the Black Basta operation has looked for alternative malware to breach networks.\nThe group's pivot to BackConnect suggests they are still working with the developers connected to the Qbot operation.\nIn a\nnew report by Trend Micr\no, researchers have found that the Cactus ransomware group is also utilizing BackConnect in attacks, indicating a potential overlap in members between both groups.\nIn the Black Basta and Cactus attacks seen by Trend Micro, the threat actors utilized the same social engineering attack of bombarding a target with an overwhelming number of emails, a\ntactic generally associated with Black Basta\n.\nThe threat actors would then contact the target through Microsoft Teams, posing as an IT help desk employee, ultimately tricking the victim into providing remote access via Windows Quick Assist.\nWhile the attack flow for the Black Basta and Cactus attacks are not identical, they were very similar, with Trend Micro finding the Cactus threat actor utilizing command and control servers usually associated with Black Basta.\nCactus attack flow\nSource: Trend Micro\nCactus ransomware emerged in early 2023 and has since targeted a range of organizations using tactics similar to Black Basta's.\nBleepingComputer's\nprevious reporting\non Cactus also showed links between the two ransomware gangs, with Cactus utilizing a PowerShell script called TotalExec that was often seen in Black Basta ransomware attacks.\nFurthermore, the Black Basta ransomware gang adopted an encryption routine that was initially unique to Cactus ransomware attacks, further strengthening the ties between both groups.\nThe shared use of tactics, BackConnect, and other operational similarities, raises questions about whether Cactus ransomware is a rebrand of Black Basta or simply an overlap between members.\nHowever, BleepingComputer has learned that Black Basta has been slowly fading away since December 2024, with their leak site offline through most of 2025.\nIt is believed that many of the Black Basta members had already begun to move to other ransomware gangs, like Cactus, with the recent data leak being the final nail in the coffin.\nRelated Articles:\nNew Cactus ransomware encrypts itself to evade antivirus\nSouthern Water says Black Basta ransomware attack cost £4.5M in expenses\nBlack Basta ransomware gang's internal chat logs leak online\nRansomware gangs pose as IT support in Microsoft Teams phishing attacks\nNew Eleven11bot botnet infects 86,000 devices for DDoS attacks"

        "Content": "Google has announced an increased rollout of new AI-powered scam detection features on Android to help protect users from increasingly sophisticated phone and text social engineering scams.\nThe tech giant says these features come in response to AI-assisted scam campaigns that, according to statistics from the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, have defrauded people of over $1 trillion.\n\"Today, we're launching two new industry-leading AI-powered scam detection features for calls and text messages, designed to protect users from increasingly complex and damaging scams,\"\nreads Google's announcement\n.\n\"These features specifically target conversational scams, which can often appear initially harmless before evolving into harmful situations.\"\nGoogle warns that traditional spam protections designed to block these attempts are ineffective at stopping sophisticated scams that manifest after the victim has already started a conversation with the fraudsters.\nTo identify and stop these scams, Google has partnered with banks and other key entities to understand the scams consumers are facing.\n\"To enhance our detection capabilities, we partnered with financial institutions around the world to better understand the latest advanced and most common scams their customers are facing. For example, users are experiencing more conversational text scams that begin innocently, but gradually manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data, handing over funds, or switching to other messaging apps. And more phone calling scammers are using spoofing techniques to hide their real numbers and pretend to be trusted companies.\nTraditional spam protections are focused on protecting users before the conversation starts, and are less effective against these latest tactics from scammers that turn dangerous mid-conversation and use social engineering techniques. To better protect users, we invested in new, intelligent AI models capable of detecting suspicious patterns and delivering real-time warnings over the course of a conversation, all while prioritizing user privacy. \"\n❖ Google\nThe new scam-protection features\nThe first set of security features is AI-powered enhancements of\nexisting spam protection mechanisms\nin Google Messages, Android's default SMS and RCS messaging app.\nGoogle says 'Scam Detection' for Messages will now detect a broader range of scam attempts, including job and item delivery lures, warning users and giving the option to report and block the sender.\nThe system, which is enabled by default, will only be activated when receiving messages from unknown senders whose numbers aren't in the user's contacts list.\nThe initial rollout will cover Android users in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada.\nA similar system will be introduced for calls, where Google's AI tool Gemini Nano will analyze conversations in real time to identify common fraud attempts, such as detecting signs of people asking for payments via gift card codes. The feature would alert the user via audio and haptic notifications when a scam is detected.\nThe new Scam Detection features in action\nSource: Google\nThis feature was\nfirst announced in November 2024\nand has been tested on a small set of Pixel 6+ devices, but it is now being rolled out to all English-speaking Pixel 9 users in the U.S..\nPixel 9 users will get the feature through Gemini Nano, while Pixel 6 to 8 series devices enrolled in Phone by Google beta will be restricted to less powerful Google AI models.\nBoth the Scam Detection for Messages and voice security features analyze the conversation data on the device without sending any sensitive information to Google, so the new features respect users' privacy.\nAlso, a characteristic \"beep\" will play at the start of the conversation, audible by both parties, to notify participants that AI-based analysis is taking place.\nStill, Google decided to keep Scam Detection for calls disabled by default to relieve privacy concerns.\nUsers can enable it by opening the Phone app, tapping the three-dot menu in the top right corner, selecting Settings → Scam Detection (if available), and toggling the feature to the ON position.\nWhen Scam Detection is active, users are still given the option to turn it off during an individual call.\nRelated Articles:\nSerbian police used Cellebrite zero-day hack to unlock Android phones\nSpyLend Android malware downloaded 100,000 times from Google Play\nGoogle blocked 2.36 million risky Android apps from Play Store in 2024\nNew Android Identity Check locks settings outside trusted locations\nGoogle fixes Android zero-day exploited by Serbian authorities"

        "Content": "A previously undocumented polyglot malware is being deployed in attacks against aviation, satellite communication, and critical transportation organizations in the United Arab Emirates.\nThe malware delivers a backdoor called Sosano, which establishes persistence on the infected devices and allows the attackers to execute commands remotely.\nThe activity was\ndiscovered by Proofpoint\nin October 2024, which states that the attacks are linked to a threat actor named 'UNK_CraftyCamel.' While the campaign is still small, the researchers report that it is still advanced and dangerous to targeted companies.\nProofpoint's researchers noted that the attacks bear similarities with operations from Iranian-aligned groups TA451 and TA455. However, the latest campaign is distinct, having a strong cyber-espionage focus.\nPolyglot threat\nPolyglot malware consists of specially crafted files that contain multiple file formats, allowing them to be interpreted differently by various applications.\nFor example, a single file could be structured as both a valid MSI (Windows installer) and a JAR (Java archive), causing Windows to recognize it as an MSI while the Java runtime interprets it as a JAR.\nThis technique enables attackers to\nstealthily deliver malicious payloads\nby evading security software, which typically analyzes files based on a single format.\nIn the new campaign observed by Proofpoint, the attack begins with a highly targeted spear-phishing email sent from a compromised Indian electronics company (INDIC Electronics).\nThese emails contain malicious URLs that direct victims to a spoofed domain (indicelectronics[.]net), where they are prompted to download a ZIP archive (\"OrderList.zip\").\nThe archive contains an LNK (Windows shortcut) file disguised as an XLS, as well as two PDF files (\"about-indic.pdf\" and \"electronica-2024.pdf\"). Both PDFs are polyglot files containing a legitimate PDF file structure but an additional malicious file structure.\nThe first PDF contains HTA (HTML Application) code, while the other includes a hidden ZIP archive.\nOne of the PDF lures used in the attacks\nSource: Proofpoint\nThe main benefit of using polyglots\nis evasion\n, as most security tools will inspect the first file format (PDF), which is a benign document, and completely ignore the malicious hidden portion (HTA/ZIP payloads).\nHTA portion in the PDF file\nSource: Proofpoint\nWhen executing the LNK file, cmd.exe launches mshta.exe, which executes the HTA script hidden inside the first PDF, triggering the launch of the second PDF file.\nThe hidden archive inside the second PDF writes a URL file to the Windows Registry for persistence and then executes an XOR-encoded JPEG file that decodes a DLL payload (\"yourdllfinal.dll\"), which is the Sosano backdoor.\nOverview of the infection chain\nSource: Proofpoint\nProofpoint says Sosano is a relatively simple Go-based payload with limited functionality that was likely bloated to 12MB in size to obfuscate what small amounts of malicious code it uses.\nOnce it's activated, Sonaso establishes a connection with its command-and-control (C2) server at \"bokhoreshonline[.]com\" and awaits commands, including file operations, shell command execution, and fetching and launching additional payloads.\nDefending against polyglot threats requires a multifaceted approach combining email scanning, user education, and security software that can detect multiple file formats in a single file.\nIf not needed in daily operations, blocking dangerous file types such as LNKs, HTAs, and ZIPs at the email gateway is prudent.\nRelated Articles:\nNew Auto-Color Linux backdoor targets North American govts, universities\nNew Eleven11bot botnet infects 86,000 devices for DDoS attacks\nVo1d malware botnet grows to 1.6 million Android TVs worldwide\nEncryptHub breaches 618 orgs to deploy infostealers, ransomware\nHave I Been Pwned adds 284M accounts stolen by infostealer malware"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nAI is all about data – and keeping AI’s data confidential both within devices and between devices is problematic. Intel offers a solution.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThe use of AI by companies is expanding rapidly. This requires the collection and processing of vast amounts of corporate data. The threat of sensitive company data and PII leaking is serious and heavily regulated by governments.\nOne problem is that AI data processing is performed on devices with GPUs (such as Nvidia), while the data source (as in parameters and prompts) is delivered through connected devices more commonly using standard CPUs (such as Intel). Mapping the data from one device to another has been achieved in software with the use of Bounce Buffers. But these add overhead to the data transfer and cannot be secured as effectively as hardware protection. Direct memory access, from one device to the other, is a better solution.\n\n\n\nIntel is addressing this by extending its TDX Connect technology on its Xeon 6 processors. TDX is the basis for Intel’s Confidential Computing – isolated and hardware-protected Trust Domains within VMs providing greater data confidentiality and integrity in cloud and virtualized environments.\n\n\n\nTDX Connect extends this concept beyond the Intel CPU to any supporting device, including GPUs, Smart NICs, and storage devices. Its relevance is primarily to Intel’s wider concept of confidential computing – but in the current technology environment, much interest will focus on the potential for confidential AI.\n\n\n\nConfidential AI\nThe data security problem for burgeoning AI applications lies in AI methodology. “AI is all about data,” explains Anand Pashupathy, VP & general manager of Intel’s security software & services division. “Parameters going in, prompts going in, data being processed, and the results coming back. A lot of this is happening without confidential computing protection.”\n\n\n\nFor him, confidential AI is the application of confidential computing to the rapidly growing use of gen-AI applications. It is a partnership between the trusted execution environment (TEE) on the CPU (that is, TDX on Intel) and the GPU’s own TEE. Data is kept confidential between the two via TDX Connect’s high performance, encrypted connection and secure direct memory access.\n\n\n\n“This helps ensure end-to-end compliance and data security,” he writes in Intel’s announcement.\n\n\n\nThe realization of Confidential AI will not be immediate – it will require specific partnerships with the manufacturers of the GPUs processing the AI. “Intel is collaborating with partners to expand the deployment of Intel TDX Connect capabilities throughout the partner ecosystem,” writes Pashupathy. The big one, of course, is Nvidia. Although there are no details of precisely when or how, “Nvidia plans to support TEE-IO [that is, TDX Connect] on its Blackwell platform.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nMicrosoft has also declared support without timeline details. “Microsoft is excited to productize Intel TDX Connect into future generations of Azure confidential VMs, which is in early development between our hardware and software developers,” said Vikas Bhatia, head of product for Azure confidential computing at Microsoft.\n\n\n\n“Intel TDX Connect represents a major milestone in our journey to improve confidential computing performance and extensibility. It enables existing and net-new workloads to benefit from the privacy assurances of confidential computing without compromising on price or performance.”\n\n\n\nOpenAI, of course, currently uses both Azure and Nvidia for its AI processing – although it is worth noting the company is developing its own custom AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia. The design phase is expected to be finalized this year, with production by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) following in 2026.\n\n\n\nWhile TDX Connect is generally expanding the realm of Intel’s confidential computing, it is also opening the potential for hardware protected confidential AI. AI is a rapidly advancing technology. Organizations know they need to use AI without necessarily knowing how to secure AI data in transit between different types of processors produced by different hardware manufacturers. TDX Connect, when adopted by Intel’s hardware partners, promises to provide surety — keeping confidential data safe and regulators at bay.\n\n\n\nRelated: Pangea Launches AI Guard and Prompt Guard to Combat Gen-AI Security Risks\nRelated: CrowdStrike to Acquire Adaptive Shield in Reported $300 Million Deal\nRelated: Cisco Unveils New AI Application Security Solution\nRelated: Beware Of Shadow AI – Shadow IT’s Less Well-Known Brother\n\nOne problem is that AI data processing is performed on devices with GPUs (such as Nvidia), while the data source (as in parameters and prompts) is delivered through connected devices more commonly using standard CPUs (such as Intel).

TDX is the basis for Intel’s Confidential Computing – isolated and hardware-protected Trust Domains within VMs providing greater data confidentiality and integrity in cloud and virtualized environments.\n\n\n\nTDX Connect extends this concept beyond the Intel CPU to any supporting device, including GPUs, Smart NICs, and storage devices. Its relevance is primarily to Intel’s wider concept of confidential computing – but in the current technology environment, much interest will focus on the potential for confidential AI.\n\n\n\nConfidential AI\nThe data security problem for burgeoning AI applications lies in AI methodology. “AI is all about data,” explains Anand Pashupathy, VP & general manager of Intel’s security software & services division. “Parameters going in, prompts going in, data being processed, and the results coming back. A lot of this is happening without confidential computing protection.”\n\n\n\nFor him, confidential AI is the application of confidential computing to the rapidly growing use of gen-AI applications. It is a partnership between the trusted execution environment (TEE) on the CPU (that is, TDX on Intel) and the GPU’s own TEE. Data is kept confidential between the two via TDX Connect’s high performance, encrypted connection and secure direct memory access.\n\n\n\n“This helps ensure end-to-end compliance and data security,” he writes in Intel’s announcement.\n\n\n\nThe realization of Confidential AI will not be immediate – it will require specific partnerships with the manufacturers of the GPUs processing the AI. “Intel is collaborating with partners to expand the deployment of Intel TDX Connect capabilities throughout the partner ecosystem,” writes Pashupathy. The big one, of course, is Nvidia. Although there are no details of precisely when or how, “Nvidia plans to support TEE-IO [that is, TDX Connect] on its Blackwell platform.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nMicrosoft has also declared support without timeline details. “Microsoft is excited to productize Intel TDX Connect into future generations of Azure confidential VMs, which is in early development between our hardware and software developers,” said Vikas Bhatia, head of product for Azure confidential computing at Microsoft.\n\n\n\n“Intel TDX Connect represents a major milestone in our journey to improve confidential computing performance and extensibility. It enables existing and net-new workloads to benefit from the privacy assurances of confidential computing without compromising on price or performance.”\n\n\n\nOpenAI, of course, currently uses both Azure and Nvidia for its AI processing – although it is worth noting the company is developing its own custom AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia. The design phase is expected to be finalized this year, with production by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) following in 2026.\n\n\n\nWhile TDX Connect is generally expanding the realm of Intel’s confidential computing, it is also opening the potential for hardware protected confidential AI.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nUnauthorized AI usage is a ticking time bomb. A tool that wasn’t considered a risk yesterday may introduce new AI-powered features overnight.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nCISOs are having to adapt at lightning speed to the rapidly changing AI landscape. DeepSeek is just the latest example of this in practice – a new ‘latest and greatest’ tool emerges and quickly tops download charts. Employees start using it at work despite the data policy explicitly stating all information will be held in China. Even the Pentagon is forced to tell its employees to stop using it. And of course DeepSeek is just the latest in what will be a long lineup of AI tools from China and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nUnauthorized AI usage is a ticking time bomb. Employees are integrating AI tools into their work, sometimes unknowingly exposing sensitive data to third-party models. And it’s also highly dynamic – a tool that wasn’t considered a risk yesterday may introduce new AI-powered features overnight. So what to do about it?\n\n\n\nBoth necessary and mandatory\nIt starts with forming an AI asset inventory since without it, organizations are flying blind, exposing sensitive data and missing critical compliance risks. And it’s now becoming mandated since regulatory frameworks such as the EU AI Act, ISO 42001, and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) make this a foundational requirement.\n\n\n\nDefining what constitutes AI is challenging. The EU AI Act adopts an extremely broad approach, encompassing nearly everything within its scope. Organizations must determine what applies to them—should they monitor every AI-enhanced feature or prioritize generative AI tools, large language models, and content creation systems? Narrowing the focus to specific AI categories can make this task much more manageable.\n\n\n\nIdentifying Shadow AI\nIt’s not just regulation, third-party vendor assessments are also increasingly requiring AI inventories, often referring to them as “audits” or “service catalogs.” However, beyond compliance, organizations cannot establish meaningful governance without a clear understanding of the AI tools employees are using. Effective governance goes beyond officially purchased tools—it involves identifying the shadow AI that has already become part of daily workflows.\n\n\n\nDespite its importance, AI asset tracking remains difficult. Most organizations rely on outdated or ineffective methods to identify AI usage, and traditional IT governance tools fall short.\n\n\n\nSix most popular existing approaches to catalogingAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThere are six approaches I see from organizations:\n\n\n\n\nProcurement-Based Tracking – Effective for monitoring new AI acquisitions but fails to detect AI features added to existing tools or employee use of tools without commercial agreements around them.\nManual Log Gathering – Analyzing network traffic and logs can help identify AI-related activity, though it is difficult, time consuming and rarely comprehensive.\nIdentity and OAuth – Reviewing access logs from providers like Okta or Entra can help track AI application usage where applicable.\nCloud Security Access Brokers and DLP – Solutions like ZScaler and Netskope offer some visibility with limited AI ‘categories’, but enforcing policies remains a challenge.\nCloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) – Wiz and others can provide good insight into AWS/Google AI Use.\nExtending Existing Inventories – Classifying AI tools based on risk ensures alignment with enterprise governance, but adoption moves quickly.\n\nAutomating manual efforts\nWhile the methods outlined above can succeed in providing differing levels of visibility into AI usage, they are highly manual and time-consuming. An AI asset inventory is more than just compiling a list—it’s about assessing the risks associated with AI adoption. Security leaders must ask key questions: Are these tools learning from employee-provided data? What are their data retention policies? How do they address privacy concerns under regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or others?\n\n\n\nThat’s why there is a shift underway towards specialized tools with more automated and repeatable methods for cataloging AI use in the enterprise. These tools provide continuous monitoring to detect AI usage, including personal and free accounts, and identify the apps training on your data.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, after gaining visibility into AI usage, these tools help organizations to safeguard sensitive data from unapproved AI systems. Security teams should evaluate existing protections to prevent employees from unintentionally sharing confidential information. Do employees know which AI tools are safe to use?\n\n\n\nSecure innovation and compliance\nAI governance should be seen as an opportunity, not just a risk management task. Organizations that stay ahead in AI tracking can actively engage employees where they are, identify unmet needs and use cases, steering them toward secure, approved AI solutions. Security leaders who share this data with AI committees and executives offer valuable insights into real-world AI usage, moving beyond theoretical policy discussions.\n\n\n\nWith AI adoption accelerating, organizations that fail to act now risk being left behind. A well-executed AI asset inventory provides visibility, mitigates risk, and establishes a strong foundation for responsible AI governance. This enables CISOs to guide their organizations toward responsible AI adoption—securing both innovation and compliance in the AI era.\n\t\t\t\nUnauthorized AI usage is a ticking time bomb.

This enables CISOs to guide their organizations toward responsible AI adoption—securing both innovation and compliance in the AI era.\n\t\t\t\nIt starts with forming an AI asset inventory since without it, organizations are flying blind, exposing sensitive data and missing critical compliance risks. And it’s now becoming mandated since regulatory frameworks such as the EU AI Act, ISO 42001, and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) make this a foundational requirement.\n\n\n\nDefining what constitutes AI is challenging.

Aryon is on a mission to prevent them.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nTel Aviv-based Aryon Security has stepped out of stealth with $9 million seed funding raised from Viola Ventures and Blumberg Capital, and with support from angel investors Shlomo Kramer, Maty Siman, and Rubi Aronashvili.\nAryon offers a Cloud Security Enforcement Platform based on the idea that prevention is better than cure. The purpose is simple: prevent misconfigurations and forgotten encryption before data is deployed to the cloud.

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n\n\n\nIdentity Automation has developed a cloud-based IAM platform that provides identity lifecycle management, access governance, and authentication capabilities. \n\n\n\nThe company specializes in dynamic identities, which frequently change and require adjustments. For example, in the education sector, the roles of students and educators change depending on grade, school and district, and the Identity Automation platform can continuously adjust access, device, and security policies based on factors such as schedule, location, role and grade.\n\n\n\n“We’re excited to bring Identity Automation’s identity and access capabilities into the Jamf platform,” said Jamf CEO John Strosahl. “By bringing our security solutions together, we’re creating a more streamlined and user-friendly experience that enables fast, dynamic access to all the resources users need to be productive.” \n\n\n\n“We see the huge potential to help organizations that have a shared-device model, deskless workers, temporary staff, or contractors.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nBroadcom patched VMware zero-days CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225 and CVE-2025-22226 after Microsoft warned it of exploitation. \nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nBroadcom released a security alert on Tuesday morning to warn VMware customers about three zero-days that have been exploited in the wild.\nThe vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225 and CVE-2025-22226,  affect VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion. Patches have been released for each impacted product, but workarounds are not available.\n\n\n\nCVE-2025-22224 has been described as a critical VMCI heap overflow vulnerability affecting VMware ESXi and Workstation that allows an attacker with local admin privileges on a virtual machine (VM) to “execute code as the virtual machine’s VMX process running on the host”.\n\n\n\nCVE-2025-22225, which affects VMware ESXi, is a high-severity arbitrary file write issue that allows an attacker with privileges within the VMX process to “trigger an arbitrary kernel write leading to an escape of the sandbox”.\n\n\n\nCVE-2025-22226 affects VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion. It’s a high-severity information disclosure flaw caused by an out-of-bounds read bug in the HGFS component, which allows an attacker who has administrative privileges to a VM to leak memory from the VMX process. \n\n\n\nAt the time of writing there does not appear to be any public information describing attacks involving these zero-days. \n\n\n\nBroadcom, which acquired VMware in 2023, pointed out that exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires elevated privileges, which indicates that they have likely been exploited in more targeted attacks after threat actors gained initial access to the victim’s systems. \n\n\n\nThis theory is reinforced by the fact that — in a supplemental FAQ document — Broadcom clarified that the zero-days can lead to a VM escape. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“This is a situation where an attacker who has already compromised a virtual machine’s guest OS and gained privileged access (administrator or root) could move into the hypervisor itself,” the vendor explained. \n\n\n\nBroadcom has credited Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center for reporting these vulnerabilities. SecurityWeek has reached out to Microsoft for additional information on the attacks and will update this article if the company responds. \n\n\n\nIt’s not uncommon for threat actors to exploit VMware product vulnerabilities in their attacks. The Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog maintained by the cybersecurity agency CISA currently includes 26 VMware flaws and the new zero-days have yet to be added. The KEV list is known to be incomplete so the actual number could be even higher.  \n\n\n\nRelated: VMware Patches High-Risk Flaws in Oft-Targeted Aria Operations Products\nRelated: VMware Discloses Exploitation of Hard-to-Fix vCenter Server Flaw\nRelated: VMware Struggles to Fix Flaw Exploited at Chinese Hacking Contest\n\nThe vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225 and CVE-2025-22226,  affect VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nExploitation has been known for months or years for most of the latest vulnerabilities added by CISA to its KEV catalog.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThe cybersecurity agency CISA on Monday added five security holes to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, but for most of them in-the-wild exploitation has been known for months or years.  \nOne of the vulnerabilities added to the CISA KEV list is CVE-2018-8639, a Windows privilege escalation vulnerability that Microsoft patched back in 2018. \n\n\n\nSouth Korean cybersecurity firm AhnLab flagged exploitation of CVE-2018-8639 in February 2023, in a report describing the attacks of a China-linked APT named Dalbit (m00nlight). According to the company, the hackers exploited CVE-2018-8639 for privilege escalation on compromised systems.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has yet to update its advisory for CVE-2018-8639 to warn customers about malicious exploitation. \n\n\n\nAnother vulnerability added to the CISA KEV list on Monday is CVE-2023-20118, a vulnerability affecting Cisco routers.\n\n\n\nExploitation of CVE-2023-20118 was recently mentioned by Sekoia in a blog post describing a backdoor and botnet named PolarEdge, which has ensnared more than 2,000 devices worldwide. The botnet has been active since at least late 2023 and it was recently seen exploiting this Cisco vulnerability to deploy a webshell on targeted routers.  \n\n\n\nCisco describes CVE-2023-20118 as a remote command execution issue that can be exploited by an authenticated attacker against small business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320 and RV325 routers. However, Sekoia says the vulnerability, for which a PoC exploit is available, can be exploited without authentication. \n\n\n\nThe impacted devices have reached end of life and Cisco is not releasing patches. At the time of writing, the networking giant’s advisory does not mention in-the-wild exploitation. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nCISA also warned organizations about CVE-2022-43939 and CVE-2022-43769, two Hitachi Vantara Pentaho BA Server vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to bypass authentication and take full control of the host. \n\n\n\nDetails of the flaws were disclosed in April 2023 and the Shadowserver Foundation reported seeing exploitation attempts shortly after. Even today hundreds of Pentaho systems are directly exposed to the internet. \n\n\n\nCISA’s KEV catalog now also includes CVE-2024-4885, a WhatsUp Gold vulnerability whose exploitation in ransomware attacks has been known since September 2024. \n\n\n\nCVE-2023-20118 is the only vulnerability whose exploitation appears to have come to light in recent days. \n\n\n\nThis shows that while CISA is in some cases the first to issue a warning over the exploitation of a vulnerability, the agency is slow to add many security holes to its KEV catalog, as highlighted on several occasions by private cybersecurity companies. \n\n\n\nRelated: CISA: No Change on Defending Against Russian Cyber Threats\nRelated: CISA Warns of Attacks Exploiting Oracle Agile PLM Vulnerability\nRelated: CISA Warns of Attacks Exploiting Craft CMS Vulnerability\n\nOne of the vulnerabilities added to the CISA KEV list is CVE-2018-8639, a Windows privilege escalation vulnerability that Microsoft patched back in 2018. \n\n\n\nSouth Korean cybersecurity firm AhnLab flagged exploitation of CVE-2018-8639 in February 2023, in a report describing the attacks of a China-linked APT named Dalbit (m00nlight).
