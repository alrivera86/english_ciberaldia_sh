        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform that leverages the Domain Name System (\nDNS\n) mail exchange (\nMX\n) records to serve fake login pages that impersonate about 114 brands.\nDNS intelligence firm Infoblox is tracking the actor behind the PhaaS, the phishing kit, and the related activity under the moniker\nMorphing Meerkat\n.\n\"The threat actor behind the campaigns often exploits open redirects on adtech infrastructure, compromises domains for phishing distribution, and distributes stolen credentials through several mechanisms, including Telegram,\" the company said in a\nreport\nshared with The Hacker News.\nOne such\ncampaign\nleveraging the PhaaS toolkit was\ndocumented\nby Forcepoint in July 2024, where phishing emails contained links to a purported shared document that, when clicked, directed the recipient to a fake login page hosted on\nCloudflare R2\nwith the end goal of collecting and exfiltrating the credentials via Telegram.\nMorphing Meerkat is estimated to have delivered thousands of spam emails, with the phishing messages using compromised WordPress websites and\nopen redirect vulnerabilities\non advertising platforms like Google-owned DoubleClick to bypass security filters.\nIt's also capable of translating phishing content text dynamically into over a dozen different languages, including English, Korean, Spanish, Russian, German, Chinese, and Japanese, to target users across the world.\nIn addition to complicating code readability via obfuscation and inflation, the phishing landing pages incorporate anti-analysis measures that prohibit the use of mouse right-click as well as keyboard hotkey combinations Ctrl + S (save the web page as HTML), Ctrl + U (open the web page source code).\nBut what makes the threat actor truly stand out is its use of DNS MX records obtained from Cloudflare or Google to identify the victim's email service provider (e.g., Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, or Yahoo!) and dynamically serve fake login pages. In the event, that the phishing kit is unable to recognize the MX record, it defaults to a\nRoundcube\nlogin page.\n\"This attack method is advantageous to bad actors because it enables them to carry out targeted attacks on victims by displaying web content strongly related to their email service provider,\" Infoblox said. \"\n\"The overall phishing experience feels natural because the design of the landing page is consistent with the spam email's message. This technique helps the actor trick the victim into submitting their email credentials via the phishing web form.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A new analysis has uncovered connections between affiliates of\nRansomHub\nand other ransomware groups like\nMedusa\n,\nBianLian\n, and\nPlay\n.\nThe connection stems from the use of a custom tool that's designed to disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) software on compromised hosts, according to ESET. The EDR killing tool, dubbed\nEDRKillShifter\n, was first documented as used by RansomHub actors in August 2024.\nEDRKillShifter accomplishes its goals by means of a known tactic called Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) that involves using a legitimate but vulnerable driver to terminate security solutions protecting the endpoints.\nThe idea with using such tools is to ensure the smooth execution of the ransomware encryptor without it being flagged by security solutions.\n\"During an intrusion, the goal of the affiliate is to obtain admin or domain admin privileges,\" ESET researchers Jakub Souček and Jan Holman\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\"Ransomware operators tend not to do major updates of their encryptors too often due to the risk of introducing a flaw that could cause issues, ultimately damaging their reputation. As a result, security vendors detect the encryptors quite well, which the affiliates react to by using EDR killers to 'get rid of' the security solution just before executing the encryptor.\"\nWhat's notable here is that a bespoke tool developed by the operators of RansomHub and offered to its affiliates – something of a rare phenomenon in itself – is being used in other ransomware attacks associated with Medusa, BianLian, and Play.\nThis aspect assumes special significance in light of the fact that both Play and BianLian operate under the closed RaaS model, wherein the operators are not actively looking to hire new affiliates and their partnerships are based on long-term mutual trust.\n\"Trusted members of Play and BianLian are collaborating with rivals, even newly emerged ones like RansomHub, and then repurposing the tooling they receive from those rivals in their own attacks,\" ESET theorized. \"This is especially interesting, since such closed gangs typically employ a rather consistent set of core tools during their intrusions.\"\nIt's being suspected that all these ransomware attacks have been carried out by the same threat actor, dubbed QuadSwitcher, who is likely related to Play the closest owing to similarities in tradecraft typically associated with Play intrusions.\nEDRKillShifter has also been observed being used by another individual ransomware affiliate known as\nCosmicBeetle\nas part of three different RansomHub and fake LockBit attacks.\nThe development comes amid a surge in ransomware attacks using\nBYOVD techniques\nto deploy EDR killers on compromised systems. Last year, the ransomware gang known as Embargo was discovered using a program called\nMS4Killer\nto neutralize security software. As recently as this month, the Medusa ransomware crew has been linked to a custom malicious driver codenamed\nABYSSWORKER\n.\n\"Threat actors need admin privileges to deploy an EDR killer, so ideally, their presence should be detected and mitigated before they reach that point,\" ESET said.\n\"Users, especially in corporate environments, should ensure that the detection of potentially unsafe applications is enabled. This can prevent the installation of vulnerable drivers.\"\nFound this article interesting?  Follow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Whether it's CRMs, project management tools, payment processors, or lead management tools - your workforce is using SaaS applications by the pound. Organizations often rely on traditional CASB solutions for protecting against malicious access and data exfiltration, but these fall short for protecting against shadow SaaS, data damage, and more.\nA new report,\nUnderstanding SaaS Security Risks: Why CASB Solutions Fail to Cover 'Shadow' SaaS and SaaS Governance\n, highlighting the pressing security challenges faced by enterprises using SaaS applications. The research underscores the growing inefficacy of traditional CASB solutions and introduces a revolutionary browser-based approach to SaaS security that ensures full visibility and real-time protection against threats.\nBelow, we bring the main highlights of the report. Read the full report\nhere\n.\nWhy Enterprises Need SaaS Security - The Risks of SaaS\nSaaS applications have become the backbone of modern enterprises, but security teams struggle to manage and protect them. Employees access and use both sanctioned and non-sanctioned apps, each entailing their own types of risk.\nNon-sanctioned apps\n- Employees often upload data files to SaaS applications, exposing the data to an unknown scope of viewers. This is in itself a violation of privacy. In addition, productivity SaaS apps are often targeted by adversaries since they are aware of the information goldmine that awaits them.\nSanctioned apps\n- Adversaries attempt to compromise SaaS app user credentials through password reuse, phishing and malicious browser extensions. With those credentials, they can access the apps and then spread across corporate environments.\nBreaking Down SaaS Risk Mitigation Capabilities\nSecurity solutions that mitigate the aforementioned SaaS risks, need to provide the following capabilities:\nGranular visibility of all users' activities within the application.\nThe ability to deduce that a malicious activity might be taking place.\nTerminating malicious activity.\nThe Limitations of CASB\nTraditionally, CASB solutions were used to secure SaaS apps. However, these solutions fall short when it comes to covering both sanctioned and unsanctioned apps, across managed and unmanaged devices.\nCASB solutions are made up of three main components: Forward Proxy, Reverse Proxy and API Scanner. Here's where they are limited:\nForward Proxy - Cannot provide access control on unmanaged devices\nReverse Proxy - Cannot prevent data exposure on unsanctioned apps\nAPI scanner - Cannot prevent malicious activity within sanctioned apps\nPlus, CASB solutions lack real-time granular visibility into app activity and have no ability to translate that into active blocking.\nThe Browser as the Ultimate Security Control Point\nA paradigm shift is required: Securing SaaS applications directly at the browser level. Access and activity in any SaaS application, sanctioned or not, typically entails establishing a browser session. Hence, if we build the SaaS risk analysis capabilities into the browser, it would also be trivial for the browser to treat detected risks as a trigger for protective action – terminating the session, disabling certain parts of the web page, preventing download\\upload, and so on.\nBrowser Security vs. CASB: The Showdown\nBrowser Security\nCASB\nUnsanctioned Apps\nDiscovery of Shadow SaaS\nYes\nPartial\nData exposure prevention\nYes\nPartial\nIdentity exposure\nYes\nNo\nSanctioned Apps\nMalicious access\nYes\nPartial\nData exposure\nYes\nYes\nData exfiltration\nYes\nNo\nData damage\nYes\nNo\nBrowser Security provides the following advantages:\n100% Visibility\n– Detects every SaaS application in use, including shadow IT.\nGranular Enforcement\n– Applies real-time security policies at the user's point of interaction.\nSeamless Integration\n– Works with identity providers (IdPs) and existing security architectures without disrupting user experience.\nUnmatched Protection\n– Prevents unauthorized access, data leakage, and credential misuse across all devices, whether managed or unmanaged.\nRead more about SaaS risk management and browser security protection in the white paper\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Hackers have long used Word and Excel documents as delivery vehicles for malware, and in 2025, these tricks are far from outdated. From phishing schemes to zero-click exploits, malicious Office files are still one of the easiest ways into a victim's system.\nHere are the top three Microsoft Office-based exploits still making the rounds this year and what you need to know to avoid them.\n1. Phishing in MS Office: Still Hackers' Favorite\nPhishing attacks using Microsoft Office files have been around for years, and they're still going strong. Why? Because they work, especially in business environments where teams constantly exchange Word and Excel documents.\nAttackers know that people are used to opening Office files, especially if they come from what looks like a colleague, a client, or a partner. A fake invoice, a shared report, or a job offer: it doesn't take much to convince someone to click. And once the file is open, the attacker has their chance.\nPhishing with Office files often aims to steal login credentials. These documents might include:\nLinks to fake Microsoft 365 login pages\nPhishing portals that mimic company tools or services\nRedirect chains that eventually land on credential-harvesting sites\nIn this ANY.RUN malware analysis session, an Excel file contains malicious phishing link:\nView analysis session with Excel file\nExcel file containing malicious link detected inside ANY.RUN sandbox\nWhen clicked, the victim is taken to a webpage that shows a Cloudflare \"Verify you're a human\" check.\nCloudFlare verification passed with ANY.RUN's automated interactivity\nAfter clicking through, there's another redirect; this time to a fake Microsoft login page.\nMalicious link to fake Microsoft login page with random characters\nAt first glance, it might look real. But inside the ANY.RUN sandbox, it's easy to spot red flags. The Microsoft login URL isn't official; it's filled with random characters and clearly doesn't belong to Microsoft's domain.\nGive your team the right tool to detect, investigate, and report threats faster in a secure environment.\nGet a trial of ANY.RUN\nto access advanced malware analysis\nThis fake login page is where the victim unknowingly hands over their login credentials straight to the attacker.\nAttackers are also getting more creative. Lately, some phishing documents come with QR codes embedded in them. These are meant to be scanned with a smartphone, sending the victim to a phishing website or triggering a malware download. However, they can be detected and analyzed with tools like ANY.RUN sandbox too.\n2. CVE-2017-11882: The Equation Editor Exploit That Won't Die\nFirst discovered in 2017, CVE-2017-11882 is still exploited today, in environments running outdated versions of Microsoft Office.\nThis vulnerability targets the Microsoft Equation Editor - a rarely used component that was part of older Office builds. Exploiting it is dangerously simple: just opening a malicious Word file can trigger the exploit. No macros, no extra clicks needed.\nIn this case, the attacker uses the flaw to download and run a malware payload in the background, often through a remote server connection.\nIn our analysis session, the payload delivered was Agent Tesla, a known info-stealer used to capture keystrokes, credentials, and clipboard data.\nView analysis session with malicious payload\nPhishing email containing malicious Excel attachment\nIn the MITRE ATT&CK section of this analysis, we can see how ANY.RUN sandbox detected this specific technique used in the attack:\nExploitation of Equation Editor detected by ANY.RUN\nAlthough Microsoft patched the vulnerability years ago, it's still useful for attackers targeting systems that haven't been updated. And with macros disabled by default in newer Office versions, CVE-2017-11882 has become a fallback for cybercriminals who want guaranteed execution.\n3. CVE-2022-30190: Follina's Still in the Game\nThe Follina exploit (CVE-2022-30190) continues to be a favorite among attackers for one simple reason: it works without macros and doesn't require any user interaction beyond opening a Word file.\nFollina abuses the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) and special URLs embedded in Office documents to execute remote code. That means just viewing the file is enough to launch malicious scripts, often PowerShell-based, that contact a command-and-control server.\nView analysis session with Follina\nFollina technique detected inside ANY.RUN sandbox\nIn our malware analysis sample, the attack went a step further. We observed the \"stegocampaign\" tag, which indicates the use of steganography - a technique where malware is hidden inside image files.\nUse of Steganography in the attack\nThe image is downloaded and processed using PowerShell, extracting the actual payload without raising immediate alarms.\nImage with malicious payload analyzed inside ANY.RUN\nTo make matters worse, Follina is often used in multi-stage attack chains, combining other vulnerabilities or payloads to increase the impact.\nWhat This Means for Teams Using MS Office\nIf your team relies heavily on Microsoft Office for day-to-day work, the attacks mentioned above should be a wake-up call.\nCybercriminals know Office files are trusted and widely used in business. That's why they continue to exploit them. Whether it's a simple Excel sheet hiding a phishing link or a Word document silently running malicious code, these files can pose serious risks to your organization's security.\nHere's what your team can do:\nReview how Office documents are handled internally;\nlimit who can open or download files from outside sources.\nUse tools like ANY.RUN\nsandbox to inspect suspicious files in a safe, isolated environment before anyone on your team opens them.\nUpdate all Office software regularly\nand disable legacy features like macros or the Equation Editor where possible.\nStay informed\nabout new exploit techniques tied to Office formats so your security team can respond quickly.\nAnalyze Mobile Malware with ANY.RUN's New Android OS Support\nThe threat doesn't stop at Office files. Mobile devices are now a key target, and attackers are spreading malware through fake apps, phishing links, and malicious APKs.\nThis means a growing attack surface for businesses and the need for broader visibility.\nWith ANY.RUN's new Android OS support, your security team can now:\nAnalyze Android malware in a real mobile environment\nInvestigate suspicious APK behavior before it hits production devices\nRespond to mobile threats faster and with more clarity\nSupport incident response across both desktop and mobile ecosystems\nIt's a big step toward complete coverage and it's available on all plans, including free.\nStart your first Android threat analysis today\nand give your security analysts the visibility they need to protect your mobile attack surface.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

As of February 2025, over 10,000 unique WordPress sites have fallen victim to the scheme.\n\"The current iteration [...] primarily targets visitors of infected WordPress sites via injected redirect scripts that employ a distributed network of Traffic Direction System (TDS) nodes hosted on compromised websites,\" security researcher Denis Sinegubko\nsaid\n.\n\"These scripts redirect site visitors to various scam pages through traffic broker networks associated with\nVexTrio\n, one of the largest known cybercriminal affiliate networks that leverages sophisticated DNS techniques, traffic distribution systems, and domain generation algorithms to deliver malware and scams across global networks.\"\nThe attacks commence with injecting a dynamically generated script into the WordPress site, ultimately redirecting visitors to VexTrio or LosPollos links. The activity is also said to have used ad networks like\nPropellerAds\nto monetize traffic from compromised sites.\nThe malicious injections on the server-side are facilitated through PHP code inserted into active plugins, while also taking steps to disable security plugins, delete malicious admin users, and siphon legitimate admin credentials to meet their objectives.\nGoDaddy has since revealed that the DollyWay TDS leverages a distributed network of compromised WordPress sites as TDS and command-and-control (C2) nodes, reaching 9-10 million monthly page impressions. Furthermore, the VexTrio redirect URLs have been found to be obtained from the\nLosPollos\ntraffic broker network.\nAround November 2024, DollyWay operators are said to have deleted several of their C2/TDS servers, with the TDS script obtaining the redirect URLs from a Telegram channel named trafficredirect.\n\"The disruption of DollyWay's relationship with LosPollos marks a significant turning point in this long-running campaign,\" Sinegubko\nnoted\n. \"While the operators have demonstrated remarkable adaptability by quickly transitioning to alternative traffic monetization methods, the rapid infrastructure changes and partial outages suggest some level of operational impact.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Environment variables are commonly targeted as they can contain API keys, database credentials, cloud credentials, and encryption keys, which can be used for further attacks.\nMalicious code introduced via update\nSource: Sonatype\nAs Sonatype malware analyst and fellow BleepingComputer reporter Ax Sharma explains in a write-up, as the malicious code is the same in all of the repositories and most have had a clean record for years, they were likely compromised in some manner.\n\"We hypothesize the cause of the hijack to be old npm maintainer accounts getting compromised either via credential stuffing (which is where threat actors retry usernames and passwords leaked in previous breaches to compromise accounts on other websites), or an expired domain takeover — both common scenarios explained in npm documentation,\"\nreports Sonatype\n.\n\"Given the concurrent timing of the attacks on multiple packages from distinct maintainers, the first scenario (maintainer accounts takeover) appears to be a more likely scenario as opposed to well-orchestrated phishing attacks.\"\nThe package names, their compromised versions, and how many times the malicious version was download are listed below:\ncountry-currency-map:\nversion 2.1.8, 288 downloads.\n@keepkey/device-protocol:\nversion 7.13.3, 56 downloads.\nbnb-javascript-sdk-nobroadcast:\nversion 2.16.16, 61 downloads.\n@bithighlander/bitcoin-cash-js-lib:\nversion 5.2.2, 61 downloads.\neslint-config-travix:\nversion 6.3.1, 0 downloads.\nbabel-preset-travix:\nversion 1.2.1, 0 downloads.\n@travix/ui-themes:\nversion 1.1.5, 0 downloads.\n@veniceswap/uikit:\nversion 0.65.34, 0 downloads.\n@crosswise-finance1/sdk-v2:\nversion 0.1.21, 0 downloads.\n@veniceswap/eslint-config-pancake:\nversion 1.6.2, 0 downloads.\nAll these packages, except for\ncountry-currency-map\n, are still available on npm, with their latest versions designated above, so downloading them will infect your projects with info-stealer malware.\nThe country-currency-map package maintainer deprecated the malicious version (2.1.8) yesterday and left a note telling developers to use version 2.1.7 instead, which is safe.\nMaintainer's notice on npm\nSource: BleepingComputer\nThe hypothesis that the attack was caused by poor npm maintainer account security is further supported by the fact that the corresponding GitHub repositories of the compromised projects were not updated with malware.\nAlthough npm has made two-factor authentication mandatory for popular projects, some of those impacted by the latest campaign are older packages with their last update several years ago.

        "Content": "A China-linked cyberespionage group known as 'FamousSparrow' was observed using a new modular version of its signature backdoor 'SparrowDoor' against a US-based trade organization.\nThe activity and new malware version were observed by security researchers at ESET, who found evidence the threat actor has been more active than initially thought since its last operations were exposed in 2022.\nApart from the financial organization, other recent attacks ESET uncovered and linked to FamousSparrow include a Mexican research institute and a government institution in Honduras.\nIn all these cases, initial access was achieved via exploitation of outdated Microsoft Exchange and Windows Server endpoints, infecting them with webshells.\nObserved attack chain\nSource: ESET\nNew modular SparrowDoor\nESET's investigation actually uncovered two new versions of the SparrowDoor backdoor.\nThe first is similar to a backdoor Trend Micro attributed to 'Earth Estries,' featuring better code quality, improved architecture, encrypted configuration, persistence mechanisms, and stealthy command-and-control (C2) switching.\nA key new feature that applies to both new versions is parallel command execution, where the backdoor can continue listening for incoming commands and processing them while it executes previous ones.\n\"Both versions of SparrowDoor used in this campaign constitute considerable advances in code quality and architecture compared to older ones,\"\nreads the ESET report\n.\n\"The most significant change is the parallelization of time-consuming commands, such as file I/O and the interactive shell. This allows the backdoor to continue handling new commands while those tasks are performed.\"\nThe most recent variant constitutes the most significant updates, as it's a modular backdoor featuring a plugin-based architecture.\nIt can receive new plugins from the C2 at runtime, which are loaded entirely in memory, expanding its operational capabilities while remaining evasive and stealthy.\nThe operations these plugins support include:\nShell access\nFile system manipulation\nKeylogging\nProxying\nScreenshot capturing\nFile transfer\nProcess listing/killing\nThe ShadowPad connection\nAnother interesting finding in ESET's report is FamousSparrow's use of ShadowPad, a versatile modular remote access trojan (RAT) associated with several\nChinese APTs\n.\nIn the attacks observed by the researchers, ShadowPad was loaded via DLL side-loading using a renamed Microsoft Office IME executable, injected into the Windows media player (wmplayer.exe) process, and connected to a known C2 server associated with the RAT.\nThis indicates that FamousSparrow may now have access to high-tier Chinese cyber tools, like other state-sponsored actors.\nESET notes that Microsoft groups FamousSparrow, GhostEmperor, and Earth Estries under one threat cluster\nthey call Salt Typhoon\n.\nGiven the lack of technical evidence to support this, ESET tracks them as distinct groups. However, it admits there are code similarities in their tools, similar exploitation techniques, and some infrastructure reuse.\nESET explains these overlaps as signs of a shared third-party supplier, aka a \"digital quartermaster,\" that hides behind and supports all these Chinese threat groups.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nChinese Weaver Ant hackers spied on telco network for 4 years\nChinese cyberspies backdoor Juniper routers for stealthy access\nSilk Typhoon hackers now target IT supply chains to breach networks\nNew NailaoLocker ransomware used against EU healthcare orgs\nChinese espionage tools deployed in RA World ransomware attack"

        "Content": "A new report sheds light on the most targeted WordPress plugin vulnerabilities hackers used in the first quarter of 2025 to compromise sites.\nAll four flaws are vulnerabilities discovered and fixed in 2024 but remain unpatched in many cases, giving hackers the opportunity to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate sensitive data.\nAmong the four flaws, which are all critical severity, are two that are reported as actively exploited for the first time.\nAccording to a\nnew Patchstack report\n, the four flaws that received the most exploitation attempts are:\nCVE-2024-27956\n: A critical SQL injection flaw in the WordPress Automatic Plugin (40,000+ installs) allowed unauthenticated attackers to run arbitrary SQL via the auth POST parameter in the CSV export feature.\nWallarm first reported\nactive exploitation of this flaw in May 2024. Patchstack says its virtual patch blocked over 6,500 attacks this year so far. (fixed in 3.92.1)\nCVE-2024-4345\n: The Startklar Elementor Addons plugin (5,000+ installs) suffered from an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability due to missing file type validation. Attackers could upload executable files and take over sites. Patchstack blocked such uploads, stopping thousands of attempts. (fixed in 1.7.14)\nCVE-2024-25600\n: A remote code execution flaw in the Bricks theme (30,000+ installs) allowed unauthenticated PHP execution via the bricks/v1/render_element REST route. Weak permission checks and an exposed nonce enabled the attack. The\nfirst signs of active exploitation\nwere spotted by both Patchstack and Wordfence in February 2024. The former now reports it has blocked several hundreds of attempts of unauthorized use of the problematic route. (fixed in 1.9.6.1)\nCVE-2024-8353\n: The GiveWP plugin (100,000+ installs) was vulnerable to PHP object injection via insecure deserialization of donation parameters like give_ and card_. This could lead to full site takeover. Patchstack filtered malicious patterns and prevented hundreds of compromise attempts. (fixed in 3.16.2)\nIt is important to note that exploitation attempts don't always lead to successful compromises, as many of these probes are blocked before they do any harm or the exploits are ineffective in achieving the desired outcome.\nHowever, given that not all websites are protected by Patchstack or other effective website security products, the chances of hackers finding more suitable conditions for exploitation across the WordPress landscape are significant.\nWebsite administrators and owners should apply the latest available security updates on all WordPress add-ons and themes and deactivate those they don't necessarily need.\nAlso, make sure that dormant accounts are deleted and strong passwords and multi-factor authentication protect administrator accounts.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nWordPress security plugin WP Ghost vulnerable to remote code execution bug\nCritical RCE flaw in Apache Tomcat actively exploited in attacks\nCritical PHP RCE vulnerability mass exploited in new attacks\nHackers exploit Cityworks RCE bug to breach Microsoft IIS servers\nVeeam RCE bug lets domain users hack backup servers, patch now"

        "Content": "Dozens of vulnerabilities in products from three leading makers of solar inverters, Sungrow, Growatt, and SMA, could be exploited to control devices or execute code remotely on the vendor’s cloud platform.\nThe potential impact of the security problems has been assessed as severe because they could be used in attacks that could at least influence grid stability, and affect user privacy.\nIn a grimmer scenario, the vulnerabilities could be exploited to disrupt or damage power grids by creating an imbalance between power generation and demand.\nHijacking PV inverters\nSecurity researchers at Vedere Labs, the cybersecurity research arm of network security company Forescout, found 46 vulnerabilities in solar inverters from Sungrow, Growatt, and SMA - three of the top six manufacturers in the world.\nThe potential impact of some of the vulnerabilities is significant as they could lead to unauthorized access to resources in cloud platforms, remote code execution (RCE), device takeover, information disclosure, physical damage, and denial of service.\nOf the 46 issues discovered, only one, CVE-2025-0731, impacts SMA products. An attacker could use it to achieve remote code execution by uploading .ASPX files that would be executed by the web server at sunnyportal.com - the company's platform for monitoring photovoltaic (PV) systems.\nIn a report today, Forescout describes how an attacker could use the newly disclosed vulnerabilities to hijack Growatt and Sungrow inverters.\nThe researchers say that taking control of Growatt inverters is easier \"because it can be achieved via the cloud backend only.\"\nHowever, they note that although control over the device is not complete, a threat actor has access to the inverter's configuration parameters and can modify them.\nHijacking Growatt inverters -\nForescout Vedere Labs\nAn attacker could enumerate without authentication usernames from an exposed Growatt API and then take over accounts by exploiting two IDOR (insecure direct object references) vulnerabilities, or steal credentials via JavaScript injection by leveraging two stored XSS issues.\nWith this type of access, a threat actor \"can perform operations on the connected inverter devices, such as switching it on or off.\"\nThe researchers say that taking control of Sungrow inverters is \"slightly more complex\" because it involves multiple vulnerable components of the vendor's architecture:\nAn attacker can harvest communication dongle serial numbers from the manufacturer’s backend through various IDORs such as CVE-2024-50685, CVE-2024-50693, and CVE-2024-50686.\nThe attacker can use the hard-coded MQTT credentials (CVE-2024-50692) to publish messages for an arbitrary inverter communication dongle by putting the correct serial number in the topic.\nThe attacker can exploit one of the stack overflow vulnerabilities CVE-2024-50694, CVE-2024-50695, or CVE-2024-50698 (all of them critical) by publishing crafted messages that lead to remote code execution on communication dongles connected to the inverter.\nThe two attack scenarios above consider only one residential and one commercial inverter but an attacker could follow the same steps to obtain serial numbers of accounts for a fleet of managed devices.\nWith control over an entire fleet of inverters, an attack on a power grid could be amplified to dangerous levels.\n\"Each inverter can modulate its power generation within the range permitted by current PV panel production levels. The combined effect of the hijacked inverters produces a large effect on power generation in the grid\" -\nForescout Vedere Labs\nAn adversary could obtain a significantly more damaging effect by controlling the hijacked devices as a botnet in a coordinated attack to reduce PV inverters' power generation during peak production hours, thus influencing the load on the grid.\nThe researchers explain that this is achieved by \"modulating the power generation of inverters inversely to the attempts of the primary control.\"\n\"When the primary control decreases the load at its maximum capacity, the attack will reduce all its load immediately, forcing the primary control to raise the load in the system followed by an immediate increase of the load by the attack\" - Forescout Vedere Labs\nApart from disrupting a power grid, the disclosed vulnerabilities can also be exploited in scenarios that impact user privacy, hijacking smart devices in the house that may be controlled through the vendor's cloud platform, or even ransomware attacks by holding the devices hostage until a ransom is paid.\nThe researchers say that\nSungrow\nand\nSMA\npatched all reported vulnerabilities, the former asking for confirmation that their fix addressed the issues and showing a willingness to improve their security posture.\nGrowatt also fixed the problems and released the patches in a way that should not involve any modification in the inverters, the researchers said.\nThe report from Forescout's Vedere Labs dives deeper in the technical details of the vulnerabilities and is available here [\nPDF\n].\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025"

        "Content": "Many successful phishing attacks result in a financial loss or malware infection. But falling for some phishing scams, like those currently targeting Russians searching online for organizations that are fighting the Kremlin war machine, can cost you your freedom or your life.\nThe real website of the Ukrainian paramilitary group “Freedom of Russia” legion. The text has been machine-translated from Russian.\nResearchers at the security firm Silent Push mapped a network of several dozen phishing domains that spoof the recruitment websites of Ukrainian paramilitary groups, as well as Ukrainian government intelligence sites.\nThe website legiohliberty[.]army features a carbon copy of the homepage for the Freedom of Russia Legion (a.k.a. “Free Russia Legion”), a three-year-old Ukraine-based paramilitary unit made up of Russian citizens who oppose Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.\nThe phony version of that website copies the legitimate site — legionliberty[.]army — providing an interactive Google Form where interested applicants can share their contact and personal details. The form asks visitors to provide their name, gender, age, email address and/or Telegram handle, country, citizenship, experience in the armed forces; political views; motivations for joining; and any bad habits.\n“Participation in such anti-war actions is considered illegal in the Russian Federation, and participating citizens are regularly charged and arrested,” Silent Push wrote in a report released today. “All observed campaigns had similar traits and shared a common objective: collecting personal information from site-visiting victims. Our team believes it is likely that this campaign is the work of either Russian Intelligence Services or a threat actor with similarly aligned motives.”\nSilent Push’s Zach Edwards said the fake Legion Liberty site shared multiple connections with rusvolcorps[.]net. That domain mimics the recruitment page for a Ukrainian far-right paramilitary group called the Russian Volunteer Corps (rusvolcorps[.]com), and uses a similar Google Forms page to collect information from would-be members.\nOther domains Silent Push connected to the phishing scheme include: ciagov[.]icu, which mirrors the content on the official website of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency; and hochuzhitlife[.]com, which spoofs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine & General Directorate of Intelligence (whose actual domain is hochuzhit[.]com).\n\nAccording to Edwards, there are no signs that these phishing sites are being advertised via email. Rather, it appears those responsible are promoting them by manipulating the search engine results shown when someone searches for one of these anti-Putin organizations.\nIn August 2024, security researcher Artem Tamoian posted on Twitter/X about how he received startlingly different results when he searched for “Freedom of Russia legion” in Russia’s largest domestic search engine Yandex versus Google.com. The top result returned by Google was the legion’s actual website, while the first result on Yandex was a phishing page targeting the group.\n“I think at least some of them are surely promoted via search,” Tamoian said of the phishing domains. “My first thread on that accuses Yandex, but apart from Yandex those websites are consistently ranked above legitimate in DuckDuckGo and Bing. Initially, I didn’t realize the scale of it. They keep appearing to this day.”\nTamoian, a native Russian who left the country in 2019, is the founder of the cyber investigation platform malfors.com. He recently discovered two other sites impersonating the Ukrainian paramilitary groups — legionliberty[.]world and rusvolcorps[.]ru — and reported both to Cloudflare. When Cloudflare responded by blocking the sites with a phishing warning, the real Internet address of these sites was exposed as belonging to a known “bulletproof hosting” network called Stark Industries Solutions Ltd.\nStark Industries Solutions appeared two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, materializing out of nowhere with hundreds of thousands of Internet addresses in its stable — many of them originally assigned to Russian government organizations. In May 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on Stark, which has repeatedly been used to host infrastructure for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, phishing, malware and disinformation campaigns from Russian intelligence agencies and pro-Kremlin hacker groups.\nIn March 2023, Russia’s Supreme Court designated the Freedom of Russia legion as a terrorist organization, meaning that Russians caught communicating with the group could face between 10 and 20 years in prison.\nTamoian said those searching online for information about these paramilitary groups have become easy prey for Russian security services.\n“I started looking into those phishing websites, because I kept stumbling upon news that someone gets arrested for trying to join [the] Ukrainian Army or for trying to help them,” Tamoian told KrebsOnSecurity. “I have also seen reports [of] FSB contacting people impersonating Ukrainian officers, as well as using fake Telegram bots, so I thought fake websites might be an option as well.”\nSearch results showing news articles about people in Russia being sentenced to lengthy prison terms for attempting to aid Ukrainian paramilitary groups.\nTamoian said reports surface regularly in Russia about people being arrested for trying carry out an action requested by a “Ukrainian recruiter,” with the courts unfailingly imposing harsh sentences regardless of the defendant’s age.\n“This keeps happening regularly, but usually there are no details about how exactly the person gets caught,” he said. “All cases related to state treason [and] terrorism are classified, so there are barely any details.”\nTamoian said while he has no direct evidence linking any of the reported arrests and convictions to these phishing sites, he is certain the sites are part of a larger campaign by the Russian government.\n“Considering that they keep them alive and keep spawning more, I assume it might be an efficient thing,” he said. “They are on top of DuckDuckGo and Yandex, so it unfortunately works.”\nFurther reading: Silent Push report, Russian Intelligence Targeting its Citizens and Informants.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Thursday 27th of March 2025 12:39 PM \r\n         \nIn the article “Getting Phished puts you in mortal danger” there’s a quote at the very end “they are on top of DuckDuckGo and Yandex, so it unfortunately works”. Does this mean the DDgo is not as secure as it claims?\nSteve Dirkx\nDallas\nDuckduckgo is just a filtered semi-distributed front-end to Bing (essentially), so it just means Bing (along with everyone else) isn’t flagging them as fake, and that whatever SEO they’re using is effective. Nothing to do with the security model of DDG.\nThe DuckDuckGo screenshot shows results for the legitimate site: legionliberty[.]army (rather than legiohliberty.army).

The SCR file is a renamed copy of a legitimate Adobe executable vulnerable to DLL sideloading.\n\n\n\nThe loaded DLL directs the victim to a login webpage, while fetching a payload in the background. A scheduled task that is created for persistence executes the payload indirectly.\n\n\n\nThe QWCrypt variant that RedCurl deploys in attacks only targets hypervisors, encrypting the virtual machines hosted on them and disabling the organization’s entire virtualized infrastructure. VMs that act as gateways are not encrypted, and the analyzed batch scripts suggest a highly targeted operation.\n\n\n\n“By keeping network gateways operational and avoiding endpoint encryption, RedCurl may have aimed to confine the attack to the IT team, preventing widespread disruption and user awareness,” Bidefender notes.\n\n\n\nTo date, there has been no evidence that RedCurl has used the data stolen from its victims for extortion, which clearly sets the threat actor apart from financially motivated groups, which “rarely prioritize the theft of proprietary information for competitive advantage”.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“[RedCurl’s] revenue generation and operational objectives remain shrouded in mystery, particularly given their sustained activity since 2018. Consequently, their business model and true motivations remain unclear,” Bitdefender notes.\n\n\n\nGiven the threat actor’s diverse victimology and lack of a consistent operational pattern, the cybersecurity firm speculates that it likely operates as a ‘gun-for-hire’ group, which would also explain its use of ransomware against infrastructure, instead of endpoints.\n\n\n\n“In a mercenary model, ransomware could serve as a diversion, masking the true objective: a targeted data exfiltration operation. It’s also possible that RedCurl, having completed a data exfiltration contract, was not paid, leading them to use ransomware as an alternate way to monetize their access,” Bitdefender notes.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the group could be focused on maintaining low-profile operations by targeting hypervisors for encryption and engaging in discreet communication with the victim organizations.\n\n\n\n“The absence of publicly visible ransom demands, such as through a dedicated leak site (DLS), does not necessarily indicate that RedCurl is not directly approaching victims. It is plausible that they engage in private negotiations, further reinforcing their preference for discreet operations and explaining their lack of public victim announcements,” Bitdefender notes.\n\n\n\nRelated: Chinese Cyberspy Possibly Launching Ransomware Attacks as Side Job\nRelated: Chinese APT Tools Found in Ransomware Schemes, Blurring Attribution Lines\nRelated: Ransomware Groups Increasingly Adopting EDR Killer Tools\nRelated: Russian Ransomware Gang Exploited Windows Zero-Day Before Patch\n\nAlso tracked as Earth Kapre or Red Wolf, RedCurl has been active since at least 2018, focused on corporate espionage and mainly targeting organizations in the US, with additional victims identified in Germany, Spain, and Mexico.\n\n\n\nThe threat actor has maintained a low-profile, using readily-available tools for intrusion and data exfiltration, but recently started employing a new ransomware dubbed QWCrypt, which marks a significant shift in its tactics.\n\n\n\nFor initial access, the group relies on phishing emails containing IMG files containing a SCR file masquerading as a CV.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nThe UK ICO has fined Advanced Computer Software Group £3 million ($3.8 million) over a 2022 data breach resulting from a ransomware attack.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nBritish software and IT services provider Advanced Computer Software Group has been fined £3 million ($3.8 million) by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) over a 2022 data breach resulting from a ransomware attack.\nAdvanced, which is operating as OneAdvanced, was targeted in 2022 by the notorious LockBit ransomware group. The attack caused significant disruptions to several of the company’s products and resulted in the information of roughly 80,000 people getting stolen.\n\n\n\nThe company caters to the UK’s National Health Service and other healthcare providers and in the case of nearly 900 people who had been receiving care at home the compromised information included details on how to enter their home. \n\n\n\nAdvanced systems were compromised through a customer account that did not have multi-factor authentication (MFA), and the ICO said the company violated data protection laws by failing to fully implement appropriate security measures, including MFA. \n\n\n\nThe ICO said the settlement is voluntary and Advanced is paying a reduced fine without an appeal. \n\n\n\n“What happened over two and a half years ago is wholly regrettable. With threat actors operating with increasing sophistication it is upon all businesses to ensure their cyber posture is continually strengthened. Cyber security remains a primary investment across our business, and we have learned a great deal as an organisation since this attack,” an Advanced spokesperson told SecurityWeek. \n\n\n\n“We reported the incident to the ICO in August 2022 and are pleased to see this matter concluded. Our focus remains steadfast on supporting our customers as they navigate the rapidly evolving technology landscape, ensuring they achieve their strategic growth and operational efficiency goals,” they added.\n\n\n\nCommenting on the fine, Trevor Dearing, director of critical infrastructure at Illumio, said, “The fine, while significantly reduced, is still substantial. It should serve as a wake-up call to all businesses that they cannot afford to neglect the basics. Containing and limiting the impact of attacks has to be the priority, and security controls like MFA, patch management, and segmentation are non-negotiable. Attackers will get in, but businesses can stop them from reaching critical data and systems if they just do the basics well.”Advertisement.

Recent research from the Ponemon Institute shows that less than half of UK businesses worry about ransomware risks from the supply chain, but the threats are rising. Complacency and overconfidence lead to successful attacks, and in today’s economy, no business can afford to lose money to cybercriminals or regulators,” Dearing told SecurityWeek.\n\n\n\nRelated: Uber to Appeal €290 Million GDPR Fine\nRelated: LinkedIn Hit With 310 Million Euro Fine for Data Privacy Violations From Irish Watchdog\nRelated: Clearview AI Fined $33.7 Million by Dutch Data Protection Watchdog Over ‘Illegal Database’ of Faces\nRelated: Infosys to Pay $17.5 Million in Settlement Over 2023 Data Breach\n\nAdvanced, which is operating as OneAdvanced, was targeted in 2022 by the notorious LockBit ransomware group.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nInterview with Taylor Pyle, a Cybersecurity Engineer at Viasat on her experience with both cyber and mentorship.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nCompanies with structured mentoring programs are estimated to have a retention rate of 72% for mentees, compared to 49% for employees without mentorship. Likewise, one report has shown that 93% of men and 83% of women recommend their organization as a great place to work when allyship is actively practiced. I can’t emphasize enough the importance that the relationship between mentor and mentee is bidirectional. The fresh ideas, innovation and different ways of thinking from mentees and mentors can be extremely valuable and help everyone grow. Also, having studied leadership at college, I learnt very early on that leadership doesn’t just mean everyone around the circle with the leader in the middle. To lead well, you have to put the appropriate others in the center of the circle in certain circumstances and situations. When everyone does their part to both lead and follow; and include people from different backgrounds, experiences  and at different stages of their careers, real change happens.\n\n\n\nAs part of International Women’s Day on the 8th of March, I had the opportunity to speak with  Taylor Pyle, a Cybersecurity Engineer at Viasat on her experience with both cyber and mentorship.  She currently serves as a Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst and talks about her career progression and the male allies and mentors who have helped her, as well as how she is helping others.\n\n\n\nTaylor, tell us a bit more about your role and your responsibilities\n“I have been working at Viasat for six years now and I’ve held a variety of different roles. My journey started as an intern, then progressed to a software engineer role working on Android applications, and finally to my current role where I started on the Dev team in the SOC. As a SOC developer, I was able to gain knowledge and grow my skill set in automation and infrastructure as I helped to maintain the monitoring infrastructure for our analysts. After about one and a half years, I became the lead for that team, which was a fantastic opportunity, especially as I had only been out of college for a couple of years. \n\n\n\n“I am very interested in cyber threat intelligence and was keen to partner with the CTI team to gain more exposure to this type of work. The threat intelligence team manager supported my involvement which led me into the role I am in today. \n\n\n\n“I have a lot of autonomy, which I enjoy. The team is open to new ideas and willing to bounce ideas off each other and there is a strong collaborative nature.  I help manage and maintain our TIP (ThreatQ) and I create automation and integrations with other security tools. One of the changes I have been able to influence is how we can share information better about what we have been tipped on or found, by using ThreatQ as our single pane of glass, as well as encouraging collaboration with other security teams.\n\n\n\n“Another area I’ve been able to influence and help with is our threat modelling process. This involves taking a technology or a particular network, figuring out what the threats and vulnerabilities are, and determining what we can do about it such as implementing different detections and mitigations. As a result, I’ve been able to create some changes in our environment and improve our security posture. This includes leading multiple threat models throughout the company and redefining our processes. For example, it used to take months to complete a threat model, I’ve shortened that down and focused more on what is important to make these models more helpful to the stakeholders.”\n\n\n\nWhat are you most proud of in your career? Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“My proudest achievement is how far I have been able to get in my career. I was the only person in the CTI team and had to learn very quickly.  I was also thrown into the deep end with certain leadership positions but somehow, I survived.\n\n\n\n“One of the challenges I experienced was when I switched to the CTI team. A few weeks after I transferred, the only other woman, who had been a big influence on me, took on a position in a different company. I was excited to work with and learn from her, and I was sad when she left, but happy for her because it was a great opportunity.  At that point, I was the only member of the CTI team, and this was a whole new field for me. I had to Google threat intelligence tips and tricks and I worked through her old SANS workbooks in my free time. I also researched fundamentals and tried to pick up where she had left off. However, six months later a new SOC manager joined, and he was heavily experienced in threat intelligence and he became a fantastic mentor.  I believe he provided real ally-ship to me and the rest of the team.”\n\n\n\nWhat challenges do women in technology face, and how can we address them? \n“Women encounter significant challenges in male-dominated fields. I am the only woman on the team, which can be a bit daunting at times, but my male colleagues are very supportive. Being the only woman in meetings, I had to learn to stand up for myself and share ideas and not just sit in the corner, even when the conversation felt male-dominated or I was unintentionally overlooked. It can be easy to be in the minority and feel like you don’t have a say, but you do.\n\n\n\n“I think another aspect is sometimes we just don’t share the same hobbies. It is harder to make small talk or contribute to conversations at social events because I don’t have anything to contribute. I think it is okay for others to still have these conversations and talk about their interests because this helps to grow relationships. What I do is I listen and try to still engage in the conversation. I try to find small ways to contribute whether it be “oh my friend plays that game or has been watching that show” or “didn’t something happen with this team?” that I had read in a headline. From the other perspective, what I have seen working is just asking what you did this weekend or ‘have you checked out this place?’ Others will take an active approach to understanding what your interests are and find common ground that then helps with future conversations.”\n\n\n\nWhat advice would you give someone looking to break into technology?\n“Find something they are passionate about by testing different avenues. There are so many different areas within cybersecurity and technology that someone can go into. Also, network and learn from other people’s experiences. They may be able to give you a unique perspective on how you could break into a certain field and learn.”\n\n\n\nIf you had to pick one mentor that had the biggest influence on you, who would it be?\n“My current boss, Damon Rouse, has been an amazing mentor to me. He has helped me to network with others and is supportive in helping me grow my career.  He has a great understanding of what good looks like and has a vast background in threat intelligence and IR and I learn a lot from him.”\n\n\n\nWhat can be done to encourage more women into the industry?\n“A couple of things: getting younger kids more involved in understanding that this is a job field to consider for their future. When I was younger, I had no idea this career existed. \n\n\n\n“I also volunteer to help children learn programming once a week, sadly there is only one girl in the class so we need to put more attention into driving exposure to close the gap.”\n\n\n\nWhy is it important to have women in leadership positions in the tech industry?\n“Having more women in leadership positions in the tech industry helps to bring different perspectives and ideas to the table. It gives other women role models to look up to. My first mentor and boss, Lauren Medica, was and is someone I still look up to and she inspires me and other women in the industry.”\n\n\n\nWhat qualities do you feel make a good leader?\n“Empathy and understanding are good leadership qualities that help you to be able to meet people where they are. At the end of the day, everyone is human, we all make mistakes, we all have personal lives and a leader is someone who supports the person in their career and outside their career, so that they can be their best self.” \n\n\n\nNow the fun question. Give us a fact about you that most other people wouldn’t know.\n“I love food and trying new places to eat, but I love CAVA, a Mediterranean quick eats place. I go there at least every other week, sometimes once a week.”\n\t\t\t\nAs part of International Women’s Day on the 8th of March, I had the opportunity to speak with  Taylor Pyle, a Cybersecurity Engineer at Viasat on her experience with both cyber and mentorship.  She currently serves as a Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst and talks about her career progression and the male allies and mentors who have helped her, as well as how she is helping others.\n\n\n\nTaylor, tell us a bit more about your role and your responsibilities\n“I have been working at Viasat for six years now and I’ve held a variety of different roles.

The threat intelligence team manager supported my involvement which led me into the role I am in today. \n\n\n\n“I have a lot of autonomy, which I enjoy. The team is open to new ideas and willing to bounce ideas off each other and there is a strong collaborative nature.  I help manage and maintain our TIP (ThreatQ) and I create automation and integrations with other security tools. One of the changes I have been able to influence is how we can share information better about what we have been tipped on or found, by using ThreatQ as our single pane of glass, as well as encouraging collaboration with other security teams.\n\n\n\n“Another area I’ve been able to influence and help with is our threat modelling process. This involves taking a technology or a particular network, figuring out what the threats and vulnerabilities are, and determining what we can do about it such as implementing different detections and mitigations. As a result, I’ve been able to create some changes in our environment and improve our security posture. This includes leading multiple threat models throughout the company and redefining our processes. For example, it used to take months to complete a threat model, I’ve shortened that down and focused more on what is important to make these models more helpful to the stakeholders.”\n\n\n\nWhat are you most proud of in your career? Advertisement.

I was the only person in the CTI team and had to learn very quickly.  I was also thrown into the deep end with certain leadership positions but somehow, I survived.\n\n\n\n“One of the challenges I experienced was when I switched to the CTI team. A few weeks after I transferred, the only other woman, who had been a big influence on me, took on a position in a different company. I was excited to work with and learn from her, and I was sad when she left, but happy for her because it was a great opportunity.  At that point, I was the only member of the CTI team, and this was a whole new field for me. I had to Google threat intelligence tips and tricks and I worked through her old SANS workbooks in my free time. I also researched fundamentals and tried to pick up where she had left off. However, six months later a new SOC manager joined, and he was heavily experienced in threat intelligence and he became a fantastic mentor.  I believe he provided real ally-ship to me and the rest of the team.”\n\n\n\nWhat challenges do women in technology face, and how can we address them? \n“Women encounter significant challenges in male-dominated fields. I am the only woman on the team, which can be a bit daunting at times, but my male colleagues are very supportive. Being the only woman in meetings, I had to learn to stand up for myself and share ideas and not just sit in the corner, even when the conversation felt male-dominated or I was unintentionally overlooked. It can be easy to be in the minority and feel like you don’t have a say, but you do.\n\n\n\n“I think another aspect is sometimes we just don’t share the same hobbies. It is harder to make small talk or contribute to conversations at social events because I don’t have anything to contribute. I think it is okay for others to still have these conversations and talk about their interests because this helps to grow relationships. What I do is I listen and try to still engage in the conversation. I try to find small ways to contribute whether it be “oh my friend plays that game or has been watching that show” or “didn’t something happen with this team?” that I had read in a headline. From the other perspective, what I have seen working is just asking what you did this weekend or ‘have you checked out this place?’ Others will take an active approach to understanding what your interests are and find common ground that then helps with future conversations.”\n\n\n\nWhat advice would you give someone looking to break into technology?\n“Find something they are passionate about by testing different avenues. There are so many different areas within cybersecurity and technology that someone can go into. Also, network and learn from other people’s experiences. They may be able to give you a unique perspective on how you could break into a certain field and learn.”\n\n\n\nIf you had to pick one mentor that had the biggest influence on you, who would it be?\n“My current boss, Damon Rouse, has been an amazing mentor to me. He has helped me to network with others and is supportive in helping me grow my career.  He has a great understanding of what good looks like and has a vast background in threat intelligence and IR and I learn a lot from him.”\n\n\n\nWhat can be done to encourage more women into the industry?\n“A couple of things: getting younger kids more involved in understanding that this is a job field to consider for their future. When I was younger, I had no idea this career existed. \n\n\n\n“I also volunteer to help children learn programming once a week, sadly there is only one girl in the class so we need to put more attention into driving exposure to close the gap.”\n\n\n\nWhy is it important to have women in leadership positions in the tech industry?\n“Having more women in leadership positions in the tech industry helps to bring different perspectives and ideas to the table. It gives other women role models to look up to. My first mentor and boss, Lauren Medica, was and is someone I still look up to and she inspires me and other women in the industry.”\n\n\n\nWhat qualities do you feel make a good leader?\n“Empathy and understanding are good leadership qualities that help you to be able to meet people where they are. At the end of the day, everyone is human, we all make mistakes, we all have personal lives and a leader is someone who supports the person in their career and outside their career, so that they can be their best self.” \n\n\n\nNow the fun question.

He has helped me to network with others and is supportive in helping me grow my career.  He has a great understanding of what good looks like and has a vast background in threat intelligence and IR and I learn a lot from him.”\n\n\n\nWhat can be done to encourage more women into the industry?\n“A couple of things: getting younger kids more involved in understanding that this is a job field to consider for their future. When I was younger, I had no idea this career existed. \n\n\n\n“I also volunteer to help children learn programming once a week, sadly there is only one girl in the class so we need to put more attention into driving exposure to close the gap.”\n\n\n\nWhy is it important to have women in leadership positions in the tech industry?\n“Having more women in leadership positions in the tech industry helps to bring different perspectives and ideas to the table. It gives other women role models to look up to. My first mentor and boss, Lauren Medica, was and is someone I still look up to and she inspires me and other women in the industry.”\n\n\n\nWhat qualities do you feel make a good leader?\n“Empathy and understanding are good leadership qualities that help you to be able to meet people where they are. At the end of the day, everyone is human, we all make mistakes, we all have personal lives and a leader is someone who supports the person in their career and outside their career, so that they can be their best self.” \n\n\n\nNow the fun question. Give us a fact about you that most other people wouldn’t know.\n“I love food and trying new places to eat, but I love CAVA, a Mediterranean quick eats place. I go there at least every other week, sometimes once a week.”\n\t\t\t\n“Women encounter significant challenges in male-dominated fields. I am the only woman on the team, which can be a bit daunting at times, but my male colleagues are very supportive. Being the only woman in meetings, I had to learn to stand up for myself and share ideas and not just sit in the corner, even when the conversation felt male-dominated or I was unintentionally overlooked. It can be easy to be in the minority and feel like you don’t have a say, but you do.\n\n\n\n“I think another aspect is sometimes we just don’t share the same hobbies. It is harder to make small talk or contribute to conversations at social events because I don’t have anything to contribute. I think it is okay for others to still have these conversations and talk about their interests because this helps to grow relationships. What I do is I listen and try to still engage in the conversation. I try to find small ways to contribute whether it be “oh my friend plays that game or has been watching that show” or “didn’t something happen with this team?” that I had read in a headline. From the other perspective, what I have seen working is just asking what you did this weekend or ‘have you checked out this place?’ Others will take an active approach to understanding what your interests are and find common ground that then helps with future conversations.”\n\n\n\nWhat advice would you give someone looking to break into technology?\n“Find something they are passionate about by testing different avenues. There are so many different areas within cybersecurity and technology that someone can go into. Also, network and learn from other people’s experiences. They may be able to give you a unique perspective on how you could break into a certain field and learn.”\n\n\n\nIf you had to pick one mentor that had the biggest influence on you, who would it be?\n“My current boss, Damon Rouse, has been an amazing mentor to me.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nT-Mobile paid $33 million in a private arbitration process over a SIM swap attack leading to cryptocurrency theft.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nCalifornia law firm Greenberg Glusker says it secured a $33 million arbitration award against T-Mobile over the wireless carrier’s mishaps related to a SIM swap attack.\nA SIM swap (or SIM swapping) attack occurs when threat actors contact the victim’s wireless carrier and convince its employees to transfer the victim’s phone number to a SIM card under the threat actor’s control.\n\n\n\nGiven that phone numbers are typically associated with various online accounts, control over a phone number can allow threat actors to change the login information for those accounts and take them over.\n\n\n\nAccording to Greenberg Glusker, the SIM swap incident that was the subject of the legal battle with T-Mobile was caused by numerous security failures at the wireless carrier, and the ruling clearly shows that telecom providers need to improve their customer protections.\n\n\n\nGreenberg Glusker notes that the ruling was kept under wraps since the fall of 2023 and T-Mobile attempted to keep details of its security failures sealed. The company revealed that the incident occurred after a threat actor accessed T-Mobile’s systems and abused them for SIM swapping. \n\n\n\nThe law firm’s petition to confirm the arbitration award, filed with a Los Angeles court and shared with SecurityWeek, reveals that the attack targeted Joseph “Josh” Jones and resulted in the theft of over 1,500 Bitcoin and roughly 60,000 Bitcoin cash – at the time valued at $38 million. \n\n\n\nThe theft was carried out on February 21, 2020, after a T-Mobile employee ported Jones’ phone number to a SIM card in the attacker’s control. \n\n\n\nBecause his account at T-Mobile had heightened security, including an eight-digit PIN that should have prevented any changes, Jones believed that the attackers might have used a backdoor on T-Mobile’s systems to take control of the account.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nLaw enforcement’s investigation into the hack revealed that a 17-year-old diagnosed with ADHD was behind it. He was reportedly linked to Nima Fazeli and Joseph O’Connor, who hijacked dozens of Twitter accounts in 2020, as well as other individuals involved in hacking.\n\n\n\nSecurityWeek emailed T-Mobile for a statement on the arbitration award but received no response by the time of publication.\n\n\n\n“SIM swapping has been an unchecked security flaw for years. Carriers like T-Mobile have known about it and failed to take basic precautions. This award makes it clear: they must do better,” Greenberg Glusker’s Paul Blechner said.\n\n\n\nThe Twitter hack that occurred in 2020 is one of the most infamous SIM swap attacks to date. Hackers targeted 130 accounts and hijacked 45 of them, including those of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Joe Biden, Elon Musk, and Mike Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, a US man was sentenced for stealing $20 million in cryptocurrency using SIM swapping, and in 2023 bankrupt cryptocurrency firms FTX, BlockFi, and Genesis disclosed data breaches after risk and financial advisory firm Kroll was targeted in a SIM swapping attack involving T-Mobile.\n\n\n\nSIM swapping is an attack technique that threat actors have been using for over a decade, and a 2020 study found that all wireless carriers in the US are vulnerable to it. In 2023, the FCC announced new rules meant to combat SIM swapping, and Aduna last month announced a partnership with AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon to strengthen customer protections.\n\n\n\nRelated: T-Mobile Shares More Information on China-Linked Cyberattack\nRelated: SEC Says X Account Hacked via SIM Swapping\nRelated: Man Sentenced to Prison for Stealing Millions in Cryptocurrency via SIM Swapping\nRelated: Los Angeles SIM Swapper Sentenced to 8 Years in Prison\n\nA SIM swap (or SIM swapping) attack occurs when threat actors contact the victim’s wireless carrier and convince its employees to transfer the victim’s phone number to a SIM card under the threat actor’s control.\n\n\n\nGiven that phone numbers are typically associated with various online accounts, control over a phone number can allow threat actors to change the login information for those accounts and take them over.\n\n\n\nAccording to Greenberg Glusker, the SIM swap incident that was the subject of the legal battle with T-Mobile was caused by numerous security failures at the wireless carrier, and the ruling clearly shows that telecom providers need to improve their customer protections.\n\n\n\nGreenberg Glusker notes that the ruling was kept under wraps since the fall of 2023 and T-Mobile attempted to keep details of its security failures sealed.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nForescout has found dozens of vulnerabilities in solar power systems from Sungrow, Growatt and SMA.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nResearchers at cybersecurity firm Forescout have found dozens of vulnerabilities across solar power system products from Sungrow, Growatt and SMA, including flaws that can pose a serious threat to electrical grids.\nSolar power has become increasingly important, particularly in the United States and Europe. However, these systems are often plagued by vulnerabilities that expose them to hacker attacks. Forescout has cataloged more than 90 vulnerabilities found over the past years in such products, and the company’s researchers recently identified 46 other flaws.\n\n\n\nThe security firm has analyzed products from the ten biggest solar power system vendors and found serious vulnerabilities in products from Sungrow, Growatt and SMA.\n\n\n\nThe main components of a solar plant are the solar panels, which generate DC power, and the inverters, which convert the DC power to AC power, enabling the harvested electricity to be fed into a commercial grid or used locally. \n\n\n\nIn addition, modern solar plants have several cyber components, including a communication component that connects the system to the internet, a cloud service where data is sent for monitoring and control, and a mobile application that enables the user to interact with the cloud service. \n\n\n\nIn the case of the SMA product, Forescout discovered a single vulnerability, which allows an attacker to upload a malicious file that will enable arbitrary code execution on the cloud platform server. \n\n\n\n[ Read: China’s Volt Typhoon Hackers Dwelled in US Electric Grid for 300 Days ]\nIn Growatt products the researchers discovered 30 vulnerabilities that can be exploited for XSS attacks, to obtain potentially valuable information, take over devices, and cause physical damage to the system.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nMore than a dozen vulnerabilities were found in Sungrow products, including insecure direct object reference (IDOR) issues, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure, as well as security holes allowing DoS attacks and remote code execution. \n\n\n\nSome of the vulnerabilities found by Forescout in these products can allow threat actors to hijack a significant number of inverters and abuse them for attacks on the power grid, including to potentially cause prolonged malfunctions. \n\n\n\n“We can hypothesize that an attacker that gained control of a large fleet of Sungrow, Growatt, and SMA inverters using the newly discovered vulnerabilities could control enough power to cause instability to [power grids],” Forescout said in a report.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the identified vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain the personal information of these products’ users, exploit compromised devices to hijack other devices on the same network, and cause financial impact to grid operators through energy price manipulation and ransomware attacks. \n\n\n\nThe impacted vendors have been notified. SMA and Sungrow patched all the vulnerabilities and published advisories to notify customers.

Forescout has cataloged more than 90 vulnerabilities found over the past years in such products, and the company’s researchers recently identified 46 other flaws.\n\n\n\nThe security firm has analyzed products from the ten biggest solar power system vendors and found serious vulnerabilities in products from Sungrow, Growatt and SMA.\n\n\n\nThe main components of a solar plant are the solar panels, which generate DC power, and the inverters, which convert the DC power to AC power, enabling the harvested electricity to be fed into a commercial grid or used locally. \n\n\n\nIn addition, modern solar plants have several cyber components, including a communication component that connects the system to the internet, a cloud service where data is sent for monitoring and control, and a mobile application that enables the user to interact with the cloud service. \n\n\n\nIn the case of the SMA product, Forescout discovered a single vulnerability, which allows an attacker to upload a malicious file that will enable arbitrary code execution on the cloud platform server. \n\n\n\n[ Read: China’s Volt Typhoon Hackers Dwelled in US Electric Grid for 300 Days ]\nIn Growatt products the researchers discovered 30 vulnerabilities that can be exploited for XSS attacks, to obtain potentially valuable information, take over devices, and cause physical damage to the system.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nMore than a dozen vulnerabilities were found in Sungrow products, including insecure direct object reference (IDOR) issues, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure, as well as security holes allowing DoS attacks and remote code execution. \n\n\n\nSome of the vulnerabilities found by Forescout in these products can allow threat actors to hijack a significant number of inverters and abuse them for attacks on the power grid, including to potentially cause prolonged malfunctions. \n\n\n\n“We can hypothesize that an attacker that gained control of a large fleet of Sungrow, Growatt, and SMA inverters using the newly discovered vulnerabilities could control enough power to cause instability to [power grids],” Forescout said in a report.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the identified vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain the personal information of these products’ users, exploit compromised devices to hijack other devices on the same network, and cause financial impact to grid operators through energy price manipulation and ransomware attacks. \n\n\n\nThe impacted vendors have been notified.

Straiker emerged from stealth mode on Thursday with a solution designed to help enterprises secure AI applications and agents.\nThe company has raised $21 million in initial funding from Lightspeed Ventures and Bain Capital Ventures. \n\n\n\nStraiker’s platform aims to address the risks associated with the increasing use of AI chatbots and AI agents. The company plans on releasing additional modules, but currently two modules are generally available.\n\n\n\nOne module, Ascend AI, enables organizations to conduct continuous testing or one-time risk assessments that involve in-depth attack simulations against AI applications and agents. The second module, Defend AI, automatically blocks threats identified by the Ascend module.\n\n\n\nStraiker tests an organization’s AI applications against LLM evasion, data leakage, harmful content, autonomous chaos, and excessive agency.  \n\n\n\nThe modules are powered by Straiker’s AI Engine, which uses a blend of small, fine-tuned models that target every layer of the AI application stack. The engine also enables customizations to address unique safety and security requirements.\n\n\n\n“The threat vector has escalated from basic prompt injection attacks to mass data exfiltration, supply chain attacks, and even autonomous chaos, as adversaries exploit AI’s language and reasoning layer vulnerabilities. AI is rapidly becoming one of the most significant cybersecurity risks. Enterprises must act now to stay ahead of these emerging risks and make AI security a top priority,” said Ankur Shah, CEO and co-founder of Straiker. \n\n\n\n“Straiker is the only AI-native platform that delivers real-time protection against attacks aimed at each layer of AI apps and Agents,” Shah added.Advertisement.
