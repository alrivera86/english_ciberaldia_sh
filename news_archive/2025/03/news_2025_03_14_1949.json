        "Content": "Most microsegmentation projects fail before they even get off the ground—too complex, too slow, too disruptive. But Andelyn Biosciences proved it doesn't have to be that way.\nMicrosegmentation: The Missing Piece in Zero Trust Security\nSecurity teams today are under constant pressure to defend against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Perimeter-based defenses alone can no longer provide sufficient protection as attackers shift their focus to lateral movement within enterprise networks. With over 70% of successful breaches involving attackers moving laterally, organizations are rethinking how they secure internal traffic.\nMicrosegmentation has emerged as a key strategy in achieving Zero Trust security by restricting access to critical assets based on identity rather than network location. However, traditional microsegmentation approaches—often involving VLAN reconfigurations, agent deployments, or complex firewall rules—tend to be slow, operationally disruptive, and difficult to scale.\nFor Andelyn Biosciences, a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) specializing in gene therapies, securing its pharmaceutical research and manufacturing environments was a top priority. But with thousands of IT, IoT, and OT devices operating across interconnected networks, a conventional segmentation approach would have introduced unacceptable complexity and downtime.\nInitially, Andelyn selected a network access control (NAC) solution to address these challenges. However, after almost two years into an implementation with high operational overhead and an inability to effectively scale segmentation, the security team became frustrated with the lack of progress. The complexity of agent-based enforcement and manual policy management made it difficult to adapt the solution to Andelyn's rapidly evolving environment.\nUltimately, they decided to pivot to Elisity's identity-based microsegmentation solution, enabling them to rapidly enforce least-privilege access policies without requiring hardware changes or network redesign.\nWatch the Virtual Case Study Replay\nHear from Bryan Holmes, VP of Information Technology at Andelyn Biosciences, and Pete Doolittle, Chief Customer Officer, Elisity to discover how a modern approach to microsegmentation accelerates Zero Trust adoption from years to weeks.\nBryan shares their journey from initial deployment to managing 2,700 active security policies—all without disrupting operations or requiring new hardware or network configurations.\nWatch Now to Learn:\nPractical strategies for implementing microsegmentation across IT and OT environments without disrupting critical pharmaceutical manufacturing and research operations.\nHow to accelerate Zero Trust initiatives by leveraging identity-based security policies that protect intellectual property, ensure regulatory compliance, and secure clinical trial data.\nHow to get real-world insights on scaling from initial proof-of-concept to enterprise-wide deployment using automated discovery, the Elisity IdentityGraph™, and dynamic policy enforcement.\nWatch the Full Case Study Here\nThe Challenge: Securing a Complex, High-Stakes Environment\nThe pharmaceutical industry faces unique security challenges. Research and manufacturing facilities house critical intellectual property and must comply with strict regulatory requirements, including NIST 800-207 and IEC 62443. At Andelyn, security leaders were increasingly concerned about the risks posed by a flat network architecture, where users, devices, and workloads shared the same infrastructure.\nDespite traditional perimeter defenses, this structure left Andelyn vulnerable to unauthorized access and lateral movement. The security team faced several key challenges:\nLack of complete visibility into all connected devices, including unmanaged IoT and OT assets.\nThe need for segmentation without disrupting operations in highly sensitive research environments.\nCompliance pressures requiring fine-grained access controls without increasing administrative overhead.\nBryan Holmes, VP of IT at Andelyn Biosciences, knew that traditional segmentation models wouldn't work. Deploying network access control (NAC) solutions or rearchitecting VLANs would have required significant downtime, impacting critical research and production timelines.\n\"We needed a microsegmentation solution that could provide immediate visibility, enforce granular security policies, and do so without requiring a massive network overhaul,\" Holmes explained.\nThe Elisity Approach: Identity-Based Segmentation Without Complexity\nUnlike legacy segmentation solutions, Elisity's approach does not rely on VLANs, firewall rules, or agent-based enforcement. Instead, it applies identity-based security policies dynamically, using the existing network switching infrastructure to enforce least-privilege access.\nAt the core of Elisity's platform is the Elisity IdentityGraph™, which correlates metadata from Active Directory, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions like CrowdStrike, and CMDB systems to create a real-time map of users, workloads, and devices. This visibility enables organizations to enforce policies based on identity, behavior, and risk—rather than static network constructs.\nFor Andelyn, this meant they could achieve full network visibility and implement segmentation in weeks rather than months or years, without operational disruption.\nDeployment: From Visibility to Policy Enforcement in Weeks\nAndelyn's segmentation journey began with comprehensive network discovery. Elisity's platform passively identified all users, workloads, and devices across IT and OT environments, including previously unmanaged assets. Within days, security teams had a complete inventory, enriched with metadata to determine which assets were trusted, unknown, or potentially rogue.\nNext, Andelyn moved to policy modeling and simulation, using Elisity's \"no-fear\" dynamic policy creation engine. Instead of enforcing policies immediately, security teams simulated segmentation rules to ensure they would not disrupt critical workflows.\nOnce validated, policies were gradually activated—first in lower-risk environments and later across production systems. Because Elisity's platform does not require reconfiguring network infrastructure, enforcement was seamless.\n\"We were able to move from monitoring mode to full policy activation in a fraction of the time we expected,\" Holmes noted. \"And we did it without disrupting research or manufacturing operations.\"\nThe Results: Stronger Security Without Added Complexity\nWith 2,700 active security policies now in place, Andelyn has significantly improved its\nZero Trust maturity\nwhile ensuring compliance with industry regulations.\nBy applying identity-based microsegmentation, the company has:\nPrevented unauthorized lateral movement, reducing the potential blast radius of a breach.\nProtected pharmaceutical research data and intellectual property from insider threats and external attacks.\nReduced operational overhead, as segmentation policies are dynamically enforced without the need for constant manual updates.\nStreamlined compliance reporting, aligning with NIST 800-207 and IEC 62443.\nUnlike traditional approaches that rely on static access lists or require dedicated segmentation hardware, Elisity's platform continuously adapts as users, workloads, and devices move across the network. Policies are cloud-managed and dynamically updated based on real-time insights from the Elisity IdentityGraph™, ensuring security remains effective even as threats evolve.\nThe Future: Scaling Microsegmentation Across the Enterprise\nFollowing the success of its initial deployment, Andelyn is now expanding microsegmentation policies to additional sites and use cases. The ability to enforce least-privilege access dynamically, without requiring major network changes, has made Elisity an essential part of the company's security strategy.\nFor other organizations facing similar challenges, Holmes offers a clear recommendation:\n\"Start with visibility. You can't protect what you don't see. From there, focus on modeling policies before enforcement. The ability to simulate policies first was a game-changer for us.\"\nMicrosegmentation is often seen as a complex, multi-year initiative that requires significant investment and operational disruption. Andelyn Biosciences' case proves otherwise—with the right approach, organizations can achieve Zero Trust segmentation in weeks, not years.\nIf your segmentation project has stalled—or worse, never really started—there's a better way. See how identity-based microsegmentation can accelerate Zero Trust in your organization.

It also contacts a remote server to download files containing the list of wallets under the threat actor's control.\n\"MassJacker creates an event handler to run whenever the victim copies anything,\" Novick said. \"The handler checks the regexes, and if it finds a match, it replaces the copied content with a wallet belonging to the threat actor from the downloaded list.\"\nCyberArk said it identified over 778,531 unique addresses belonging to the attackers, with only 423 of them containing funds totaling approximately $95,300. But the total amount of digital assets held in all these wallets prior to them being transferred out stands at around $336,700.\nWhat's more, cryptocurrency worth about $87,000 (600 SOL) has been found parked in a single wallet, with over 350 transactions funneling money into the wallet from different addresses.\nExactly who is behind MassJacker is unknown, although a deeper examination of the source code has identified overlaps with\nanother malware\nknown as\nMassLogger\n, which has also leveraged JIT hooking in an attempt to resist analysis efforts.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The Black Basta ransomware operation created an automated brute-forcing framework dubbed 'BRUTED' to breach edge networking devices like firewalls and VPNs.\nThe framework has enabled BlackBasta to streamline initial network access and scale ransomware attacks on vulnerable internet-exposed endpoints.\nThe discovery of BRUTED comes from EclecticIQ researcher\nArda Büyükkaya\nfollowing an in-depth examination of the\nransomware gang's leaked internal chat logs\n.\nSeveral\nreports\nof\nlarge-scale brute-forcing\nand\npassword spray attacks\nagainst those devices\nthroughout 2024\n, some of which might be linked to BRUTED or similar-origin operations.\nAutomating brute-forcing\nBüyükkaya says Black Basta has been using the automated BRUTED platform since 2023 to conduct large-scale credential-stuffing and brute-force attacks on edge network devices.\nAnalysis of the source code indicates that the framework was specifically designed to brute-force credentials on the following VPN and remote-access products: SonicWall NetExtender, Palo Alto GlobalProtect, Cisco AnyConnect, Fortinet SSL VPN, Citrix NetScaler (Citrix Gateway), Microsoft RDWeb (Remote Desktop Web Access), and WatchGuard SSL VPN.\nAttack approach used for each product\nSource: EclecticIQ\nThe framework searches for publicly accessible edge networking devices matching the targets list by enumerating subdomains, resolving IP addresses, and appending prefixes like '.vpn' or 'remote.' Matches are reported back to the command-and-control (C2) server.\nOnce potential targets are identified, BRUTED retrieves password candidates from a remote server and combines them with locally generated guesses to execute many authentication requests via multiple CPU processes.\nBüyükkaya shared the source code with BleepingComputer, which shows how the tool utilizes specific request headers and user agents for each targeted device in the brute force attacks.\nSource code snippet for Cisco AnyConnect (ASA) brute force function\nSource: BleepingComputer\nThe\nEclecticIQ report\nsays BRUTED can extract Common Name (CN) and Subject Alternative Names (SAN) from the SSL certificates of targeted devices, which helps generate additional password guesses based on the target's domain and naming conventions.\nOverview of Black Basta attacks involving BRUTED\nSource: EclecticIQ\nTo evade detection, the framework uses a list of SOCKS5 proxies with an interesting domain name that hides the attacker's infrastructure behind an intermediate layer.\nProxy servers used by Black Basta's BUSTED framework\nSource: BleepingCoputer\nIts main infrastructure comprises multiple servers in Russia and is registered under Proton66 (AS 198953).\nLeaked chat logs also revealed internal discussions about server downtime due to unpaid fees, which were later renewed, giving us a glimpse of the day-to-day operations ransomware gangs have to deal with.\nDefending against brute-forcing\nTools like BRUTED streamline ransomware operations by breaching many networks at once with minimal effort, increasing the monetization opportunities for threat actors.\nA key defense strategy is to enforce strong, unique passwords for all edge devices and VPN accounts and use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to block access even when credentials are compromised.\nIt is also crucial to monitor for authentication attempts from unknown locations and high-volume login failures and implement rate-limiting and account lockout policies.\nElecticIQ has shared a list of IPs and domains used by BRUTED that can be used to create new firewall rules that block requests from known malicious infrastructure.\nWhile BRUTED does not exploit any vulnerabilities to breach network edge devices, it is still crucial to keep those devices up-to-date by applying the latest security updates.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nHackers use FastHTTP in new high-speed Microsoft 365 password attacks\nMicrosoft Teams tactics, malware connect Black Basta, Cactus ransomware\nNew Cactus ransomware encrypts itself to evade antivirus\nSouthern Water says Black Basta ransomware attack cost £4.5M in expenses\nBlack Basta ransomware gang's internal chat logs leak online"

        "Content": "A clever malware deployment scheme first spotted in targeted attacks last year has now gone mainstream. In this scam, dubbed “ClickFix,” the visitor to a hacked or malicious website is asked to distinguish themselves from bots by pressing a combination of keyboard keys that causes Microsoft Windows to download password-stealing malware.\nClickFix attacks mimic the “Verify You are a Human” tests that many websites use to separate real visitors from content-scraping bots. This particular scam usually starts with a website popup that looks something like this:\nThis malware attack pretends to be a CAPTCHA intended to separate humans from bots.\nClicking the “I’m not a robot” button generates a pop-up message asking the user to take three sequential steps to prove their humanity.\nExecuting this series of keypresses prompts Windows to download password-stealing malware.\nStep 1 involves simultaneously pressing the keyboard key with the Windows icon and the letter “R,” which opens a Windows “Run” prompt that will execute any specified program that is already installed on the system.\nStep 2 asks the user to press the “CTRL” key and the letter “V” at the same time, which pastes malicious code from the site’s virtual clipboard.\nStep 3 — pressing the “Enter” key — causes Windows to download and launch malicious code through “mshta.exe,” a Windows program designed to run Microsoft HTML application files.\n“This campaign delivers multiple families of commodity malware, including XWorm, Lumma stealer, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RAT,” Microsoft wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “Depending on the specific payload, the specific code launched through mshta.exe varies. Some samples have downloaded PowerShell, JavaScript, and portable executable (PE) content.”\nAccording to Microsoft, hospitality workers are being tricked into downloading credential-stealing malware by cybercriminals impersonating Booking.com. The company said attackers have been sending malicious emails impersonating Booking.com, often referencing negative guest reviews, requests from prospective guests, or online promotion opportunities — all in a bid to convince people to step through one of these ClickFix attacks.\nIn November 2024, KrebsOnSecurity reported that hundreds of hotels that use booking.com had been subject to targeted phishing attacks. Some of those lures worked, and allowed thieves to gain control over booking.com accounts. From there, they sent out phishing messages asking for financial information from people who’d just booked travel through the company’s app.\nEarlier this month, the security firm Arctic Wolf warned about ClickFix attacks targeting people working in the healthcare sector. The company said those attacks leveraged malicious code stitched into the widely used physical therapy video site HEP2go that redirected visitors to a ClickFix prompt.\nAn alert (PDF) released in October 2024 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services warned that the ClickFix attack can take many forms, including fake Google Chrome error pages and popups that spoof Facebook.\nClickFix tactic used by malicious websites impersonating Google Chrome, Facebook, PDFSimpli, and reCAPTCHA. Source: Sekoia.\nThe ClickFix attack — and its reliance on mshta.exe — is reminiscent of phishing techniques employed for years that hid exploits inside Microsoft Office macros. Malicious macros became such a common malware threat that Microsoft was forced to start blocking macros by default in Office documents that try to download content from the web.\nAlas, the email security vendor Proofpoint has documented plenty of ClickFix attacks via phishing emails that include HTML attachments spoofing Microsoft Office files. When opened, the attachment displays an image of Microsoft Word document with a pop-up error message directing users to click the “Solution” or “How to Fix” button.\nHTML files containing ClickFix instructions. Examples for attachments named “Report_” (on the left) and “scan_doc_” (on the right). Image: Proofpoint.\nOrganizations that wish to do so can take advantage of Microsoft Group Policy restrictions to prevent Windows from executing the “run” command when users hit the Windows key and the “R” key simultaneously.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Friday 14th of March 2025 06:15 PM \r\n         \nYour email address will not be published.

Krebs previously reported that other six-figure cryptocurrency heists were also related to the LastPass breach. The LastPass hack resulted in password vault data getting stolen, but the password manager says it has not seen definitive proof that these heists are related to the 2022 breach.\n\n\n\nESP32 chip ‘backdoor’ claims disputed\nEspressif, the manufacturer of ESP32, a microcontroller that enables WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity and is present in millions of IoT devices, has disputed claims of a backdoor in its products and shared some clarifications after researchers warned of security risks. Researchers at Tarlogic said they had found a ‘backdoor’ in ESP32 that could “allow hostile actors to conduct impersonation attacks and permanently infect sensitive devices such as mobile phones, computers, smart locks or medical equipment by bypassing code audit controls”. The researchers later renamed the findings from ‘backdoor’ to ‘hidden feature’. Espressif pointed out that the commands in question are not accessible remotely and they don’t pose a security risk on their own, but still promised to push updates to remove them.Advertisement.

The security firm reported seeing an updated SideWinder toolset and new infrastructure used to deliver malware and control hacked systems. \n\n\n\nCredential security report\nCredential security company Dashlane has released its State of Credential Security Report, which is based on a survey of 500 IT decision makers and 1,000 workers in the US. The survey found that 80% of leaders observed increased phishing volume and sophistication, and nearly as many feel that AI poses an increased threat to password security. Nearly 40% of employees have had to deal with phishing at work.\n\n\n\n70% of secrets leaked in 2022 remain active\nAccording to GitGuardian’s 2025 State of Secrets Sprawl report, nearly 24 million secrets (API keys, passwords, and authentication tokens) were leaked in public GitHub repositories last year, a 25% YoY increase. The company’s analysis found that 70% of secrets leaked in 2022 remain active today.\n\n\n\nAlleged Garantex co-founder arrested\nAleksej Besciokov, a Lithuanian man believed to be the co-founder of Garantex, a major cryptocurrency exchange accused of facilitating money laundering and sanctions violations, has been arrested in India while vacationing with his family, Brian Krebs reported. The news came just days after the US DoJ announced the seizure of the online infrastructure used to run Garantex, as well as an indictment against Besciokov and another alleged co-founder, Russian national Aleksandr Mira Serda.\n\n\n\nApache Camel, Moxa, Palo Alto Networks vulnerabilities\nSeveral vulnerabilities came to light this week. CVE-2025-27636 is an Apache Camel vulnerability that can lead to remote code execution. CVE-2024-12297 is a critical authentication bypass flaw affecting Moxa PT switches.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nThe ClickFix technique has been employed by cybercrime and APT groups for information stealer and other malware deployment.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nSince August 2024, both state-sponsored hackers and cybercriminals have been adopting a technique called ClickFix to deploy information stealer malware, cybersecurity firm Group-IB reports.\nClickFix is a social engineering technique in which malicious JavaScript code on web pages prompts the user to perform an action that results in the delivery of a malicious payload.\n\n\n\nTypically, the user sees a prompt instructing them to perform an update, fix an error, or verify that they are human on a fake reCAPTCHA page containing malicious code.\n\n\n\nThe malicious JavaScript code copies a command to the clipboard, and the user is instructed to open the Windows Run dialogue by pressing Win+R, paste the clipboard content using the Ctrl+V key combination, and hit Enter.\n\n\n\nThis causes the malicious command to be executed on the victim’s machine, and a malware payload to be delivered, typically an information stealer such as Lumma, XWorm RAT, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, and others. In one instance, the final payload was the DarkGate malware.\n\n\n\nGroup-IB observed threat actors relying on phishing emails, malvertising, and spam messages on forums, social media platforms, and comment sections to direct victims to malicious websites, phishing sites mimicking legitimate services, and compromised websites hosting malicious code associated with ClickFix.\n\n\n\nAn earlier iteration of the technique was observed in October 2023, disguised as a Cloudflare anti-bot protection prompt. The broad adoption of the more mature technique called ClickFix, however, started in August 2024, and appears to have accelerated since the beginning of 2025.\n\n\n\nHunting for both the fake reCAPTCHA element and for the copy-to-clipboard functionality observed in these attacks, Group-IB identified multiple variants of ClickFix pages that impersonate Google reCAPTCHA, social media sites, Cloudflare bot protection, or claim issues with the user’s browser.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nAll variations work in a similar manner: the user is prompted to click on the ‘I’m not a robot’, ‘Fix it’, or ‘Copy Fix’ prompt, which automatically copies the malicious code to the clipboard, and then to execute the code in the Run dialog.\n\n\n\n“The possibilities are endless, and the technique continues to evolve, finding innovative ways to deceive users. As threat actors refine their methods, we can expect even more sophisticated variants to emerge,” Group-IB notes.\n\n\n\nThe cybersecurity firm observed ClickFix attacks targeting users of websites offering free movies, games, or cracked software, GitHub users, and enterprise users. It also notes that APT groups such as Iran-linked MuddyWater and Russia-linked APT28 have been employing the ClickFix technique in their attacks.\n\n\n\nThis week, Microsoft warned of attacks against the hospitality sector in North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia leveraging the ClickFix technique, and Cofense detailed its use in the distribution of the XWorm RAT.\n\n\n\nRelated: Homebrew macOS Users Targeted With Information Stealer Malware\nRelated: ‘SteelFox’ Miner and Information Stealer Bundle Emerges\nRelated: Threat Actors Abuse GitHub to Distribute Multiple Information Stealers\nRelated: Information Stealer Exploits Windows SmartScreen Bypass\n\nClickFix is a social engineering technique in which malicious JavaScript code on web pages prompts the user to perform an action that results in the delivery of a malicious payload.\n\n\n\nTypically, the user sees a prompt instructing them to perform an update, fix an error, or verify that they are human on a fake reCAPTCHA page containing malicious code.\n\n\n\nThe malicious JavaScript code copies a command to the clipboard, and the user is instructed to open the Windows Run dialogue by pressing Win+R, paste the clipboard content using the Ctrl+V key combination, and hit Enter.\n\n\n\nThis causes the malicious command to be executed on the victim’s machine, and a malware payload to be delivered, typically an information stealer such as Lumma, XWorm RAT, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, and others.

He has been accused of helping develop the LockBit ransomware, which he allegedly admitted after he was taken into custody by Israeli authorities in August 2024.\n\n\n\nAuthorities have accused him of working on the LockBit malware between June 2022 and February 2024, for which he received roughly $10,000 worth of cryptocurrency per month.

It also announced the availability of its AI Trust Score Manager.\nThe former gives CISOs greater visibility into the strengths, weaknesses and risks associated with different gen-AI foundational models, while the latter can operationalize quantitative controls on the gen-AI responses of in-house deployments.\n\n\n\nAI Trust Scores evaluates and quantifies risk based on nine critical factors: prompt injection, hallucinations, insecure output handling, security, toxicity, sensitive information disclosure, supply chain vulnerability, psychological safety and fairness.\n\n\n\nThe result can be a bit surprising in specific areas. For example, Chinese DeepSeek performs very well on sensitive information disclosure.

Gen-AI responses are non-deterministic,” explains Tumeryk CEO Rohit Valia. “By using the AI Trust Score they can implement safeguards to ensure the systems are operating within an established Trust Zone.

Based on policy (built using the AI Trust Score thresholds defined or written in Nvidia Conversational Language (Colang)), the user is or is not allowed to receive a response from the LLM.

        "Date": "2025-03-14",
        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nYour guide on how to get through the conference with your sanity, energy, and key performance indicators (KPIs) intact.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nIt’s that time of year. Marketing teams are under water with event strategy for booths, parties, and everything else. The media are hiding from public relations professionals. Chief information security officers (CISOs) are running from salespeople. Everyone is bracing themselves for extroversion. Presenters are frantically sifting through data to bring together presentations. Yup, it’s RSA Conference prep time.\nI wanted to do a guide on how to get through the conference with your sanity, energy, and key performance indicators (KPIs) intact, but from the lens of a different mix of contributors: one of this year’s keynoters, company founders, an industry analyst, a former journalist-turned-executive, tech leaders, and, of course, marketers. Tips range from everything from keeping your body and mind in good shape with a “power break”  to tricks for making the most of your networking to getting out of your comfort zone.\n\n\n\nI’ve been going to RSA Conference since it was still in San Jose, CA, since the early aughts, minus COVID, and that is a blessed curse of being a marketer. I will be there again this year, representing my company as well as speaking at the event, but I want to leave all the tips for maximizing your time to the array of experts I described above. In their own words, here we go.\n\n\n\nBill Brenner, 21-year RSA Conference veteran as journalist, researcher, and executive\nFor the newcomers: RSAC is big, loud and overwhelming, like the force of a waterfall coming down on top of you.  When those moments hit, remember that you are one person and can’t get to everything. Prioritize what you most need from the conference and shape the meetings, sessions and keynotes you attend around that. The older I get — the more RSACs I notch — the more I care about seeing friends above all.\n\n\n\nFor those of us who are “of an age”: The industry has changed so much in the last 20 years, and the evolution of RSAC has reflected that. It has gotten bigger as we have gotten older. Remember when the show floor was only in Moscone South? By the next decade, exhibitors occupied Moscone South and North. Today, every square inch of that level is full of exhibits.\n\n\n\nI haven’t gone to many talks in recent years because networking time has become my top priority. But whenever there’s a talk friends are doing and that everyone is excited about, I make the time. When I find old friends, they’re usually accompanied by people I haven’t met before. And so new relationships are born.  When you can mix the old and new into your networking, a rich learning experience is assured.\n\n\n\nNicole Drake,  Senior Product Marketing Manager, Vectra AIAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nEquip and Prepare your team: Success at events starts before you even arrive. Ensure your team is well-prepared with a solid understanding of the key conversations you want to drive.\n\n\n\nPrioritize Quality over Quantity: Time is limited, and everyone is competing for attention. Focus on the depth of engagements rather than the sheer number of interactions. In my experience, some leaders measure event success by the number of scanned leads or demos. However, months later, many of these leads fizzle out. While big events help with overall brand awareness, meaningful impact from high-quality leads – those identified through early discovery, thoughtful planning, and active listening really help to move the needle and create trusting relationships in the long-run.\n\n\n\nIt’s ok to say no to someone if they are not a good fit for your product/solution, you don’t need to be everything to everyone. Trying to appeal to everyone dilutes your differentiation, and prospects/customers can sense that.\n\n\n\nLead With Intention: Approach every aspect of the event with purpose, from booth design and messaging to the content you share and the conversations you engage in. Events are what you make of them. They offer rare opportunities to build relationships that may not happen otherwise—so make every interaction count.\n\n\n\nCasey Ellis, Founder and Advisor, Bugcrowd\nPlan with Purpose: Decide on one or two key goals for the week – Whether it’s meeting people, attending certain talks, or diving into a particular topic in the villages. Conferences like RSAC are overwhelming, so having a focus and sticking to it will help you prioritize and avoid burnout.\n\n\n\nBig Rocks First: I’ll tend to go into a conference with key talks that I want to catch, events to attend, and people that I absolutely don’t want to miss. The trick here is to keep this list small and organize everything else around filling in the gaps.\n\n\n\nOptimize for Serendipity: Some of the best connections and conversations happen outside the formal sessions. Make time to walk the expo floor, chat with vendors, and strike up conversations in lounges or nearby hotel lobbies. For me, the most valuable thing about RSAC is the community.\n\n\n\nHave a Wingperson: Know who of your peers and friends will be there and try to have one or two people that you’re “doing the conference with” – This helps keep you on-track, and can be incredible for making sure that you, and they, are looking after themselves.\n\n\n\nBalance Work and Rest: Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. Schedule downtime to recharge – Whether it’s a quiet dinner with friends, a walk down by the Embarcadero, or a little time to stare at a wall in your hotel room. You’ll be more effective and present for the rest of the week.\n\n\n\nChris Eng, Cybersecurity Consultant and Advisor\nBe cognizant of the need to recharge and build downtime into your day. For example, I often go sit on a bench in Yerba Buena and enjoy lunch by myself, which helps me regenerate energy for the afternoon. Similarly, an hour in the hotel room before going out to evening events work wonders.\n\n\n\nBe clear on your goals for the event, whether it’s exploring career prospects, getting feedback on an idea, learning more about certain topics, meeting specific people, and so on. This will help you prioritize when there are overlapping options to pick from.\n\n\n\nDon’t oversubscribe to parties and happy hours. Turn FOMO into JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) and prioritize quality time with small groups of friends/colleagues. Conversations at a 4- to 6-person dinner can be so much more fulfilling, especially in contrast with the dozens of 2-minute interactions you’ve had all day long.\n\n\n\nSome large events are unavoidable, of course. Pair up with extroverted friends who will bear the brunt of the small talk and “people-ing”. Practice conversational exits so you can easily move on.\n\n\n\nAfter an interesting conversation with someone new, jot down some quick notes. Use those notes to add context when you connect with the person later on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nBronwen Hudson, Marketing Lead, RevealRisk\nLesson 1: You will always have FOMO. Accept it as part of the experience. My best advice? Make choices that keep your boundaries intact regardless of the pressure to party, to drink, to take swag, and so on.\n\n\n\nLesson 2: If you’re involved with a booth, make friends with a couple of event staff ASAP. Thank them, offer them a swag item, have a chat and a joke. Later, it is almost guaranteed they will save your life in some way or another (with an extension cord or a drill in all likelihood).\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Make a bag of booth essentials:\n\n\n\n\nMints, or those Listerine strips are best (no gum).\nNew travel sized deodorant and/or body spray (for you or others).\nLip balm. Buy a pack of six and you’ll be a hero, too.\nStationery kit: Sharpies, pair of scissors, roll of packing tape. These will be your friends at the end of the show!\n\nWhen in doubt, take two deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. You’re going to be FINE!\n\n\n\nJohn Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence, Trellix\nAs a seasoned RSA Conference attendee (and someone giving a keynote this year), let me share a few practical tips that go beyond the usual advice.\n\n\n\nFirst, if your schedule allows it, start each morning with a brief workout—this jump-starts your energy and mental clarity for the busy day ahead. Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy! Your brain gets bombarded from all sides – noisy vendor booths, non-stop meetings, and after-hours events that somehow feel mandatory. It’s a lot.\n\n\n\nWhen it all gets too much, try these quick sanity-savers:\n\n\n\n\nSneak in some deep breaths between sessions (nobody will notice!)\nFind a quiet spot for a quick mental reset when you’re about to snap\nUse your walks between venues to clear your head\nDon’t cram your schedule – give yourself breathing room\nDecide what actually matters each morning before the chaos starts\nKeep water and snacks handy (conference hunger is real and so is getting hangry!)\nHave one place for all your notes so ideas don’t vanish\nPack noise-canceling headphones for instant peace\nScout out a couple “escape spots” away from the madness\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 trick: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste, to help ground you\n\nThese little mental breaks will help you handle the constant switching without completely short-circuiting!\n\n\n\nFernando Montenegro, Vice President and Practice Lead, Cybersecurity, The Futurum GroupHave a plan: You can spend time roaming expo floor, watching talks, chatting up with strangers, reconnecting with friends from industry, checking in with your vendors, hanging out hallway-con-style, doing research on a particular topic, attending adjacent breakfast/lunch/happy hour/dinner events, and more. All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it. As a rule of thumb, assume a minimum 15 minutes between events.\n\n\n\nMany talks either fill to capacity quickly or have long queues to enter. Plan accordingly, consider pre-registering if that is an option.\n\n\n\nDo you REALLY want that swag? Personal preference, of course, but generic expo floor swag is, well, generic.\n\n\n\nKeep an open mind: The conference brings together all types of people, from newbies to veterans and everything in between, including investors, marketers, policy people, and more. Be open to different viewpoints, be respectful, and have a wonderful time!\n\n\n\nMariana Padilla, Co-Founder and CEO of HACKERverse.ai\nEvery three hours or so, I like to find a quiet corner in Moscone to reset. Listening to white noise or calming sounds helps clear my mind and prevent conference burnout.\n\n\n\nLarge afterparties may be exciting, but unless you’re just there to booze it up, they rarely offer decent networking opportunities. Instead, focus on smaller, more curated gatherings, where real connections are made.\n\n\n\nBe authentic in conversations—genuinely listen to what others are working on, rather than just pitching yourself. Long-term relationships drive success in cybersecurity, so think beyond just this event.\n\n\n\nStart reaching out NOW to the key people you want to meet before schedules fill up.\n\n\n\nDon’t overdo it with the free caffeine available on the expo floor. Too much caffeine late in the day keeps me up and prevents a good night of sleep. There’s nothing worse than sleeping poorly during an important conference.\n\n\n\nLastly, follow up in real-time—sending a quick LinkedIn message or email while the conversation is fresh will set you apart.\n\n\n\nJen VanAntwerp, Owner at JVAN Consulting and Founder at Sober in Cyber\nI travel with a heating pad, as well as icy hot patches that can be worn under my clothes if I start to ache after running around all day. If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break. To enjoy a power break, take your shoes off, lay on the bed facing the opposite direction, scoot your too shy close to the headboard, and rest your legs at around a 90° angle. This is also a great time to place that heating pad under your lower back.\n\n\n\nAfter even just a 10-minute power break, I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the day. Before going to bed, jot down a list of the people you’ve met, the things you’ve discussed, and any information you’ll need for follow-ups.\n\n\n\nI take a picture of any business cards I’ve been given before placing them in my pocket or bag (which saved my bacon once when I accidentally put some cards through the laundry!).\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying not to drink, always have a non-alcoholic beverage in your hand.

I would add two things to this list. The first is something that my sales and marketing teams have heard from me for decades: “NO HUDDLING.” If you send a group, that group should divide and conquer rather than always be together. You will force multiply your outcomes. The second is, given the diverse network of attendees from CEOs, founders, venture capitalists, policy makers, security leaders and practitioners of all types, if you’re a vendor or trying to gain business, be sure to send folks who can have strategic conversations with any of those profiles and actively mentor those who can’t yet while they do it, as it will help better show the breadth of your expertise.\n\n\n\nRelated: Beyond the Buzz: Rethinking Alcohol as a Cybersecurity Bonding Ritual\n\nI wanted to do a guide on how to get through the conference with your sanity, energy, and key performance indicators (KPIs) intact, but from the lens of a different mix of contributors: one of this year’s keynoters, company founders, an industry analyst, a former journalist-turned-executive, tech leaders, and, of course, marketers. Tips range from everything from keeping your body and mind in good shape with a “power break”  to tricks for making the most of your networking to getting out of your comfort zone.\n\n\n\nI’ve been going to RSA Conference since it was still in San Jose, CA, since the early aughts, minus COVID, and that is a blessed curse of being a marketer. I will be there again this year, representing my company as well as speaking at the event, but I want to leave all the tips for maximizing your time to the array of experts I described above. In their own words, here we go.\n\n\n\nBill Brenner, 21-year RSA Conference veteran as journalist, researcher, and executive\nFor the newcomers: RSAC is big, loud and overwhelming, like the force of a waterfall coming down on top of you.  When those moments hit, remember that you are one person and can’t get to everything. Prioritize what you most need from the conference and shape the meetings, sessions and keynotes you attend around that. The older I get — the more RSACs I notch — the more I care about seeing friends above all.\n\n\n\nFor those of us who are “of an age”: The industry has changed so much in the last 20 years, and the evolution of RSAC has reflected that. It has gotten bigger as we have gotten older. Remember when the show floor was only in Moscone South? By the next decade, exhibitors occupied Moscone South and North. Today, every square inch of that level is full of exhibits.\n\n\n\nI haven’t gone to many talks in recent years because networking time has become my top priority. But whenever there’s a talk friends are doing and that everyone is excited about, I make the time. When I find old friends, they’re usually accompanied by people I haven’t met before. And so new relationships are born.  When you can mix the old and new into your networking, a rich learning experience is assured.\n\n\n\nNicole Drake,  Senior Product Marketing Manager, Vectra AIAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nEquip and Prepare your team: Success at events starts before you even arrive. Ensure your team is well-prepared with a solid understanding of the key conversations you want to drive.\n\n\n\nPrioritize Quality over Quantity: Time is limited, and everyone is competing for attention. Focus on the depth of engagements rather than the sheer number of interactions. In my experience, some leaders measure event success by the number of scanned leads or demos. However, months later, many of these leads fizzle out. While big events help with overall brand awareness, meaningful impact from high-quality leads – those identified through early discovery, thoughtful planning, and active listening really help to move the needle and create trusting relationships in the long-run.\n\n\n\nIt’s ok to say no to someone if they are not a good fit for your product/solution, you don’t need to be everything to everyone. Trying to appeal to everyone dilutes your differentiation, and prospects/customers can sense that.\n\n\n\nLead With Intention: Approach every aspect of the event with purpose, from booth design and messaging to the content you share and the conversations you engage in. Events are what you make of them. They offer rare opportunities to build relationships that may not happen otherwise—so make every interaction count.\n\n\n\nCasey Ellis, Founder and Advisor, Bugcrowd\nPlan with Purpose: Decide on one or two key goals for the week – Whether it’s meeting people, attending certain talks, or diving into a particular topic in the villages. Conferences like RSAC are overwhelming, so having a focus and sticking to it will help you prioritize and avoid burnout.\n\n\n\nBig Rocks First: I’ll tend to go into a conference with key talks that I want to catch, events to attend, and people that I absolutely don’t want to miss. The trick here is to keep this list small and organize everything else around filling in the gaps.\n\n\n\nOptimize for Serendipity: Some of the best connections and conversations happen outside the formal sessions. Make time to walk the expo floor, chat with vendors, and strike up conversations in lounges or nearby hotel lobbies. For me, the most valuable thing about RSAC is the community.\n\n\n\nHave a Wingperson: Know who of your peers and friends will be there and try to have one or two people that you’re “doing the conference with” – This helps keep you on-track, and can be incredible for making sure that you, and they, are looking after themselves.\n\n\n\nBalance Work and Rest: Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. Schedule downtime to recharge – Whether it’s a quiet dinner with friends, a walk down by the Embarcadero, or a little time to stare at a wall in your hotel room. You’ll be more effective and present for the rest of the week.\n\n\n\nChris Eng, Cybersecurity Consultant and Advisor\nBe cognizant of the need to recharge and build downtime into your day. For example, I often go sit on a bench in Yerba Buena and enjoy lunch by myself, which helps me regenerate energy for the afternoon. Similarly, an hour in the hotel room before going out to evening events work wonders.\n\n\n\nBe clear on your goals for the event, whether it’s exploring career prospects, getting feedback on an idea, learning more about certain topics, meeting specific people, and so on. This will help you prioritize when there are overlapping options to pick from.\n\n\n\nDon’t oversubscribe to parties and happy hours. Turn FOMO into JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) and prioritize quality time with small groups of friends/colleagues. Conversations at a 4- to 6-person dinner can be so much more fulfilling, especially in contrast with the dozens of 2-minute interactions you’ve had all day long.\n\n\n\nSome large events are unavoidable, of course. Pair up with extroverted friends who will bear the brunt of the small talk and “people-ing”. Practice conversational exits so you can easily move on.\n\n\n\nAfter an interesting conversation with someone new, jot down some quick notes. Use those notes to add context when you connect with the person later on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nBronwen Hudson, Marketing Lead, RevealRisk\nLesson 1: You will always have FOMO. Accept it as part of the experience. My best advice? Make choices that keep your boundaries intact regardless of the pressure to party, to drink, to take swag, and so on.\n\n\n\nLesson 2: If you’re involved with a booth, make friends with a couple of event staff ASAP. Thank them, offer them a swag item, have a chat and a joke. Later, it is almost guaranteed they will save your life in some way or another (with an extension cord or a drill in all likelihood).\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Make a bag of booth essentials:\n\n\n\n\nMints, or those Listerine strips are best (no gum).\nNew travel sized deodorant and/or body spray (for you or others).\nLip balm. Buy a pack of six and you’ll be a hero, too.\nStationery kit: Sharpies, pair of scissors, roll of packing tape. These will be your friends at the end of the show!\n\nWhen in doubt, take two deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. You’re going to be FINE!\n\n\n\nJohn Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence, Trellix\nAs a seasoned RSA Conference attendee (and someone giving a keynote this year), let me share a few practical tips that go beyond the usual advice.\n\n\n\nFirst, if your schedule allows it, start each morning with a brief workout—this jump-starts your energy and mental clarity for the busy day ahead. Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy! Your brain gets bombarded from all sides – noisy vendor booths, non-stop meetings, and after-hours events that somehow feel mandatory. It’s a lot.\n\n\n\nWhen it all gets too much, try these quick sanity-savers:\n\n\n\n\nSneak in some deep breaths between sessions (nobody will notice!)\nFind a quiet spot for a quick mental reset when you’re about to snap\nUse your walks between venues to clear your head\nDon’t cram your schedule – give yourself breathing room\nDecide what actually matters each morning before the chaos starts\nKeep water and snacks handy (conference hunger is real and so is getting hangry!)\nHave one place for all your notes so ideas don’t vanish\nPack noise-canceling headphones for instant peace\nScout out a couple “escape spots” away from the madness\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 trick: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste, to help ground you\n\nThese little mental breaks will help you handle the constant switching without completely short-circuiting!\n\n\n\nFernando Montenegro, Vice President and Practice Lead, Cybersecurity, The Futurum GroupHave a plan: You can spend time roaming expo floor, watching talks, chatting up with strangers, reconnecting with friends from industry, checking in with your vendors, hanging out hallway-con-style, doing research on a particular topic, attending adjacent breakfast/lunch/happy hour/dinner events, and more. All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it. As a rule of thumb, assume a minimum 15 minutes between events.\n\n\n\nMany talks either fill to capacity quickly or have long queues to enter. Plan accordingly, consider pre-registering if that is an option.\n\n\n\nDo you REALLY want that swag? Personal preference, of course, but generic expo floor swag is, well, generic.\n\n\n\nKeep an open mind: The conference brings together all types of people, from newbies to veterans and everything in between, including investors, marketers, policy people, and more. Be open to different viewpoints, be respectful, and have a wonderful time!\n\n\n\nMariana Padilla, Co-Founder and CEO of HACKERverse.ai\nEvery three hours or so, I like to find a quiet corner in Moscone to reset. Listening to white noise or calming sounds helps clear my mind and prevent conference burnout.\n\n\n\nLarge afterparties may be exciting, but unless you’re just there to booze it up, they rarely offer decent networking opportunities. Instead, focus on smaller, more curated gatherings, where real connections are made.\n\n\n\nBe authentic in conversations—genuinely listen to what others are working on, rather than just pitching yourself. Long-term relationships drive success in cybersecurity, so think beyond just this event.\n\n\n\nStart reaching out NOW to the key people you want to meet before schedules fill up.\n\n\n\nDon’t overdo it with the free caffeine available on the expo floor. Too much caffeine late in the day keeps me up and prevents a good night of sleep. There’s nothing worse than sleeping poorly during an important conference.\n\n\n\nLastly, follow up in real-time—sending a quick LinkedIn message or email while the conversation is fresh will set you apart.\n\n\n\nJen VanAntwerp, Owner at JVAN Consulting and Founder at Sober in Cyber\nI travel with a heating pad, as well as icy hot patches that can be worn under my clothes if I start to ache after running around all day. If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break. To enjoy a power break, take your shoes off, lay on the bed facing the opposite direction, scoot your too shy close to the headboard, and rest your legs at around a 90° angle. This is also a great time to place that heating pad under your lower back.\n\n\n\nAfter even just a 10-minute power break, I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the day. Before going to bed, jot down a list of the people you’ve met, the things you’ve discussed, and any information you’ll need for follow-ups.\n\n\n\nI take a picture of any business cards I’ve been given before placing them in my pocket or bag (which saved my bacon once when I accidentally put some cards through the laundry!).\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying not to drink, always have a non-alcoholic beverage in your hand.

Turn FOMO into JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) and prioritize quality time with small groups of friends/colleagues.

Pair up with extroverted friends who will bear the brunt of the small talk and “people-ing”.

Accept it as part of the experience. My best advice? Make choices that keep your boundaries intact regardless of the pressure to party, to drink, to take swag, and so on.\n\n\n\nLesson 2: If you’re involved with a booth, make friends with a couple of event staff ASAP. Thank them, offer them a swag item, have a chat and a joke. Later, it is almost guaranteed they will save your life in some way or another (with an extension cord or a drill in all likelihood).\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Make a bag of booth essentials:\n\n\n\n\nMints, or those Listerine strips are best (no gum).\nNew travel sized deodorant and/or body spray (for you or others).\nLip balm.

You’re going to be FINE!\n\n\n\nJohn Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence, Trellix\nAs a seasoned RSA Conference attendee (and someone giving a keynote this year), let me share a few practical tips that go beyond the usual advice.\n\n\n\nFirst, if your schedule allows it, start each morning with a brief workout—this jump-starts your energy and mental clarity for the busy day ahead. Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy! Your brain gets bombarded from all sides – noisy vendor booths, non-stop meetings, and after-hours events that somehow feel mandatory. It’s a lot.\n\n\n\nWhen it all gets too much, try these quick sanity-savers:\n\n\n\n\nSneak in some deep breaths between sessions (nobody will notice!)\nFind a quiet spot for a quick mental reset when you’re about to snap\nUse your walks between venues to clear your head\nDon’t cram your schedule – give yourself breathing room\nDecide what actually matters each morning before the chaos starts\nKeep water and snacks handy (conference hunger is real and so is getting hangry!)\nHave one place for all your notes so ideas don’t vanish\nPack noise-canceling headphones for instant peace\nScout out a couple “escape spots” away from the madness\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 trick: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste, to help ground you\n\nThese little mental breaks will help you handle the constant switching without completely short-circuiting!\n\n\n\nFernando Montenegro, Vice President and Practice Lead, Cybersecurity, The Futurum GroupHave a plan: You can spend time roaming expo floor, watching talks, chatting up with strangers, reconnecting with friends from industry, checking in with your vendors, hanging out hallway-con-style, doing research on a particular topic, attending adjacent breakfast/lunch/happy hour/dinner events, and more. All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it. As a rule of thumb, assume a minimum 15 minutes between events.\n\n\n\nMany talks either fill to capacity quickly or have long queues to enter. Plan accordingly, consider pre-registering if that is an option.\n\n\n\nDo you REALLY want that swag? Personal preference, of course, but generic expo floor swag is, well, generic.\n\n\n\nKeep an open mind: The conference brings together all types of people, from newbies to veterans and everything in between, including investors, marketers, policy people, and more. Be open to different viewpoints, be respectful, and have a wonderful time!\n\n\n\nMariana Padilla, Co-Founder and CEO of HACKERverse.ai\nEvery three hours or so, I like to find a quiet corner in Moscone to reset. Listening to white noise or calming sounds helps clear my mind and prevent conference burnout.\n\n\n\nLarge afterparties may be exciting, but unless you’re just there to booze it up, they rarely offer decent networking opportunities. Instead, focus on smaller, more curated gatherings, where real connections are made.\n\n\n\nBe authentic in conversations—genuinely listen to what others are working on, rather than just pitching yourself. Long-term relationships drive success in cybersecurity, so think beyond just this event.\n\n\n\nStart reaching out NOW to the key people you want to meet before schedules fill up.\n\n\n\nDon’t overdo it with the free caffeine available on the expo floor. Too much caffeine late in the day keeps me up and prevents a good night of sleep. There’s nothing worse than sleeping poorly during an important conference.\n\n\n\nLastly, follow up in real-time—sending a quick LinkedIn message or email while the conversation is fresh will set you apart.\n\n\n\nJen VanAntwerp, Owner at JVAN Consulting and Founder at Sober in Cyber\nI travel with a heating pad, as well as icy hot patches that can be worn under my clothes if I start to ache after running around all day. If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break. To enjoy a power break, take your shoes off, lay on the bed facing the opposite direction, scoot your too shy close to the headboard, and rest your legs at around a 90° angle. This is also a great time to place that heating pad under your lower back.\n\n\n\nAfter even just a 10-minute power break, I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the day. Before going to bed, jot down a list of the people you’ve met, the things you’ve discussed, and any information you’ll need for follow-ups.\n\n\n\nI take a picture of any business cards I’ve been given before placing them in my pocket or bag (which saved my bacon once when I accidentally put some cards through the laundry!).\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying not to drink, always have a non-alcoholic beverage in your hand. That cuts down on the number of people who might ask, “whatcha drinking?”.\n\n\n\nGianna Whitver, Co-Founder and CEO, Cybersecurity Marketing SocietyRSAC Conference is the biggest networking opportunity of the year.

The second is, given the diverse network of attendees from CEOs, founders, venture capitalists, policy makers, security leaders and practitioners of all types, if you’re a vendor or trying to gain business, be sure to send folks who can have strategic conversations with any of those profiles and actively mentor those who can’t yet while they do it, as it will help better show the breadth of your expertise.\n\n\n\nRelated: Beyond the Buzz: Rethinking Alcohol as a Cybersecurity Bonding Ritual\n\nFor those of us who are “of an age”: The industry has changed so much in the last 20 years, and the evolution of RSAC has reflected that. It has gotten bigger as we have gotten older. Remember when the show floor was only in Moscone South? By the next decade, exhibitors occupied Moscone South and North. Today, every square inch of that level is full of exhibits.\n\n\n\nI haven’t gone to many talks in recent years because networking time has become my top priority. But whenever there’s a talk friends are doing and that everyone is excited about, I make the time. When I find old friends, they’re usually accompanied by people I haven’t met before. And so new relationships are born.  When you can mix the old and new into your networking, a rich learning experience is assured.\n\n\n\nNicole Drake,  Senior Product Marketing Manager, Vectra AIAdvertisement.

Conferences like RSAC are overwhelming, so having a focus and sticking to it will help you prioritize and avoid burnout.\n\n\n\nBig Rocks First: I’ll tend to go into a conference with key talks that I want to catch, events to attend, and people that I absolutely don’t want to miss.

For example, I often go sit on a bench in Yerba Buena and enjoy lunch by myself, which helps me regenerate energy for the afternoon. Similarly, an hour in the hotel room before going out to evening events work wonders.\n\n\n\nBe clear on your goals for the event, whether it’s exploring career prospects, getting feedback on an idea, learning more about certain topics, meeting specific people, and so on. This will help you prioritize when there are overlapping options to pick from.\n\n\n\nDon’t oversubscribe to parties and happy hours. Turn FOMO into JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) and prioritize quality time with small groups of friends/colleagues. Conversations at a 4- to 6-person dinner can be so much more fulfilling, especially in contrast with the dozens of 2-minute interactions you’ve had all day long.\n\n\n\nSome large events are unavoidable, of course. Pair up with extroverted friends who will bear the brunt of the small talk and “people-ing”. Practice conversational exits so you can easily move on.\n\n\n\nAfter an interesting conversation with someone new, jot down some quick notes. Use those notes to add context when you connect with the person later on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nBronwen Hudson, Marketing Lead, RevealRisk\nLesson 1: You will always have FOMO. Accept it as part of the experience. My best advice? Make choices that keep your boundaries intact regardless of the pressure to party, to drink, to take swag, and so on.\n\n\n\nLesson 2: If you’re involved with a booth, make friends with a couple of event staff ASAP. Thank them, offer them a swag item, have a chat and a joke. Later, it is almost guaranteed they will save your life in some way or another (with an extension cord or a drill in all likelihood).\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Make a bag of booth essentials:\n\n\n\n\nMints, or those Listerine strips are best (no gum).\nNew travel sized deodorant and/or body spray (for you or others).\nLip balm. Buy a pack of six and you’ll be a hero, too.\nStationery kit: Sharpies, pair of scissors, roll of packing tape. These will be your friends at the end of the show!\n\nWhen in doubt, take two deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. You’re going to be FINE!\n\n\n\nJohn Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence, Trellix\nAs a seasoned RSA Conference attendee (and someone giving a keynote this year), let me share a few practical tips that go beyond the usual advice.\n\n\n\nFirst, if your schedule allows it, start each morning with a brief workout—this jump-starts your energy and mental clarity for the busy day ahead. Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy! Your brain gets bombarded from all sides – noisy vendor booths, non-stop meetings, and after-hours events that somehow feel mandatory. It’s a lot.\n\n\n\nWhen it all gets too much, try these quick sanity-savers:\n\n\n\n\nSneak in some deep breaths between sessions (nobody will notice!)\nFind a quiet spot for a quick mental reset when you’re about to snap\nUse your walks between venues to clear your head\nDon’t cram your schedule – give yourself breathing room\nDecide what actually matters each morning before the chaos starts\nKeep water and snacks handy (conference hunger is real and so is getting hangry!)\nHave one place for all your notes so ideas don’t vanish\nPack noise-canceling headphones for instant peace\nScout out a couple “escape spots” away from the madness\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 trick: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste, to help ground you\n\nThese little mental breaks will help you handle the constant switching without completely short-circuiting!\n\n\n\nFernando Montenegro, Vice President and Practice Lead, Cybersecurity, The Futurum GroupHave a plan: You can spend time roaming expo floor, watching talks, chatting up with strangers, reconnecting with friends from industry, checking in with your vendors, hanging out hallway-con-style, doing research on a particular topic, attending adjacent breakfast/lunch/happy hour/dinner events, and more. All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it. As a rule of thumb, assume a minimum 15 minutes between events.\n\n\n\nMany talks either fill to capacity quickly or have long queues to enter. Plan accordingly, consider pre-registering if that is an option.\n\n\n\nDo you REALLY want that swag? Personal preference, of course, but generic expo floor swag is, well, generic.\n\n\n\nKeep an open mind: The conference brings together all types of people, from newbies to veterans and everything in between, including investors, marketers, policy people, and more. Be open to different viewpoints, be respectful, and have a wonderful time!\n\n\n\nMariana Padilla, Co-Founder and CEO of HACKERverse.ai\nEvery three hours or so, I like to find a quiet corner in Moscone to reset. Listening to white noise or calming sounds helps clear my mind and prevent conference burnout.\n\n\n\nLarge afterparties may be exciting, but unless you’re just there to booze it up, they rarely offer decent networking opportunities. Instead, focus on smaller, more curated gatherings, where real connections are made.\n\n\n\nBe authentic in conversations—genuinely listen to what others are working on, rather than just pitching yourself. Long-term relationships drive success in cybersecurity, so think beyond just this event.\n\n\n\nStart reaching out NOW to the key people you want to meet before schedules fill up.\n\n\n\nDon’t overdo it with the free caffeine available on the expo floor. Too much caffeine late in the day keeps me up and prevents a good night of sleep. There’s nothing worse than sleeping poorly during an important conference.\n\n\n\nLastly, follow up in real-time—sending a quick LinkedIn message or email while the conversation is fresh will set you apart.\n\n\n\nJen VanAntwerp, Owner at JVAN Consulting and Founder at Sober in Cyber\nI travel with a heating pad, as well as icy hot patches that can be worn under my clothes if I start to ache after running around all day. If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break. To enjoy a power break, take your shoes off, lay on the bed facing the opposite direction, scoot your too shy close to the headboard, and rest your legs at around a 90° angle. This is also a great time to place that heating pad under your lower back.\n\n\n\nAfter even just a 10-minute power break, I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the day. Before going to bed, jot down a list of the people you’ve met, the things you’ve discussed, and any information you’ll need for follow-ups.\n\n\n\nI take a picture of any business cards I’ve been given before placing them in my pocket or bag (which saved my bacon once when I accidentally put some cards through the laundry!).\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying not to drink, always have a non-alcoholic beverage in your hand. That cuts down on the number of people who might ask, “whatcha drinking?”.\n\n\n\nGianna Whitver, Co-Founder and CEO, Cybersecurity Marketing SocietyRSAC Conference is the biggest networking opportunity of the year. Everyone is there: CEOs to security practitioners to investors. It’s your best time to network…as long as you don’t burn out!\n\n\n\nSign up for the parties early (like now!) – skip the big blowouts and attend some of the smaller, intimate ones. Reach out to advance to the party sponsors or host.\n\n\n\nMake sure to schedule meetings in advance. LinkedIn can be cringey, but announcing your attendance can help others plan to meet you.\n\n\n\nAt the event, take breaks often. Try to cushion your meetings with 3-5 minutes in between for notes and action items on the meeting and just to heal your introverted soul a little.\n\n\n\nThankfully the setting – despite its flaws sometimes – garners plenty of opportunity to step outside and do some deep breathing when it all becomes too much! Hang in there, you’ve got this!\n\n\n\nJeffrey Wheatman, SVP, Cyber Risk Strategist, Black Kite\nMake sure you set up your agenda in advance. It’s tempting to wait until the last minute to decide what you want to attend. That is a rookie mistake. Aside from the fact that it’s super overwhelming, the popular sessions get booked out.\n\n\n\nDon’t get too hung up on “tracks” – there are going to be sessions that are interesting but not in your track. Step outside your comfort zone\n\n\n\nIf you have time, see if the speakers have spoken elsewhere and check them out if you can – nothing worse than hitting a session and having the speaker be low energy or awkward.\n\n\n\nI usually skip sessions given by “circuit speakers” – they are everywhere, including YouTube\n\n\n\nMake sure you leave time to network and connect with friends and colleagues\n\n\n\nSkip the big parties – too crowded, too noisy, and why wait in line?\n\n\n\nDon’t party too hard the first few days.\n\n\n\nStrike a balance between big topics, niche sessions, and interactive content. One of the coolest sessions I’ve seen was a book club session.\n\n\n\nGet there a day early, if you can, especially if you are crossing multiple time zones.\n\n\n\nI’m grateful to those who pitched in for this guide and I hope it serves both newbies and oldies alike. I would add two things to this list. The first is something that my sales and marketing teams have heard from me for decades: “NO HUDDLING.” If you send a group, that group should divide and conquer rather than always be together.

Similarly, an hour in the hotel room before going out to evening events work wonders.\n\n\n\nBe clear on your goals for the event, whether it’s exploring career prospects, getting feedback on an idea, learning more about certain topics, meeting specific people, and so on. This will help you prioritize when there are overlapping options to pick from.\n\n\n\nDon’t oversubscribe to parties and happy hours. Turn FOMO into JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) and prioritize quality time with small groups of friends/colleagues. Conversations at a 4- to 6-person dinner can be so much more fulfilling, especially in contrast with the dozens of 2-minute interactions you’ve had all day long.\n\n\n\nSome large events are unavoidable, of course. Pair up with extroverted friends who will bear the brunt of the small talk and “people-ing”. Practice conversational exits so you can easily move on.\n\n\n\nAfter an interesting conversation with someone new, jot down some quick notes. Use those notes to add context when you connect with the person later on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nBronwen Hudson, Marketing Lead, RevealRisk\nLesson 1: You will always have FOMO. Accept it as part of the experience. My best advice? Make choices that keep your boundaries intact regardless of the pressure to party, to drink, to take swag, and so on.\n\n\n\nLesson 2: If you’re involved with a booth, make friends with a couple of event staff ASAP. Thank them, offer them a swag item, have a chat and a joke. Later, it is almost guaranteed they will save your life in some way or another (with an extension cord or a drill in all likelihood).\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Make a bag of booth essentials:\n\n\n\n\nMints, or those Listerine strips are best (no gum).\nNew travel sized deodorant and/or body spray (for you or others).\nLip balm. Buy a pack of six and you’ll be a hero, too.\nStationery kit: Sharpies, pair of scissors, roll of packing tape. These will be your friends at the end of the show!\n\nWhen in doubt, take two deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. You’re going to be FINE!\n\n\n\nJohn Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence, Trellix\nAs a seasoned RSA Conference attendee (and someone giving a keynote this year), let me share a few practical tips that go beyond the usual advice.\n\n\n\nFirst, if your schedule allows it, start each morning with a brief workout—this jump-starts your energy and mental clarity for the busy day ahead. Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy! Your brain gets bombarded from all sides – noisy vendor booths, non-stop meetings, and after-hours events that somehow feel mandatory. It’s a lot.\n\n\n\nWhen it all gets too much, try these quick sanity-savers:\n\n\n\n\nSneak in some deep breaths between sessions (nobody will notice!)\nFind a quiet spot for a quick mental reset when you’re about to snap\nUse your walks between venues to clear your head\nDon’t cram your schedule – give yourself breathing room\nDecide what actually matters each morning before the chaos starts\nKeep water and snacks handy (conference hunger is real and so is getting hangry!)\nHave one place for all your notes so ideas don’t vanish\nPack noise-canceling headphones for instant peace\nScout out a couple “escape spots” away from the madness\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 trick: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste, to help ground you\n\nThese little mental breaks will help you handle the constant switching without completely short-circuiting!\n\n\n\nFernando Montenegro, Vice President and Practice Lead, Cybersecurity, The Futurum GroupHave a plan: You can spend time roaming expo floor, watching talks, chatting up with strangers, reconnecting with friends from industry, checking in with your vendors, hanging out hallway-con-style, doing research on a particular topic, attending adjacent breakfast/lunch/happy hour/dinner events, and more. All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it. As a rule of thumb, assume a minimum 15 minutes between events.\n\n\n\nMany talks either fill to capacity quickly or have long queues to enter. Plan accordingly, consider pre-registering if that is an option.\n\n\n\nDo you REALLY want that swag? Personal preference, of course, but generic expo floor swag is, well, generic.\n\n\n\nKeep an open mind: The conference brings together all types of people, from newbies to veterans and everything in between, including investors, marketers, policy people, and more. Be open to different viewpoints, be respectful, and have a wonderful time!\n\n\n\nMariana Padilla, Co-Founder and CEO of HACKERverse.ai\nEvery three hours or so, I like to find a quiet corner in Moscone to reset. Listening to white noise or calming sounds helps clear my mind and prevent conference burnout.\n\n\n\nLarge afterparties may be exciting, but unless you’re just there to booze it up, they rarely offer decent networking opportunities. Instead, focus on smaller, more curated gatherings, where real connections are made.\n\n\n\nBe authentic in conversations—genuinely listen to what others are working on, rather than just pitching yourself. Long-term relationships drive success in cybersecurity, so think beyond just this event.\n\n\n\nStart reaching out NOW to the key people you want to meet before schedules fill up.\n\n\n\nDon’t overdo it with the free caffeine available on the expo floor. Too much caffeine late in the day keeps me up and prevents a good night of sleep. There’s nothing worse than sleeping poorly during an important conference.\n\n\n\nLastly, follow up in real-time—sending a quick LinkedIn message or email while the conversation is fresh will set you apart.\n\n\n\nJen VanAntwerp, Owner at JVAN Consulting and Founder at Sober in Cyber\nI travel with a heating pad, as well as icy hot patches that can be worn under my clothes if I start to ache after running around all day. If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break. To enjoy a power break, take your shoes off, lay on the bed facing the opposite direction, scoot your too shy close to the headboard, and rest your legs at around a 90° angle. This is also a great time to place that heating pad under your lower back.\n\n\n\nAfter even just a 10-minute power break, I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the day. Before going to bed, jot down a list of the people you’ve met, the things you’ve discussed, and any information you’ll need for follow-ups.\n\n\n\nI take a picture of any business cards I’ve been given before placing them in my pocket or bag (which saved my bacon once when I accidentally put some cards through the laundry!).\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying not to drink, always have a non-alcoholic beverage in your hand. That cuts down on the number of people who might ask, “whatcha drinking?”.\n\n\n\nGianna Whitver, Co-Founder and CEO, Cybersecurity Marketing SocietyRSAC Conference is the biggest networking opportunity of the year. Everyone is there: CEOs to security practitioners to investors. It’s your best time to network…as long as you don’t burn out!\n\n\n\nSign up for the parties early (like now!) – skip the big blowouts and attend some of the smaller, intimate ones. Reach out to advance to the party sponsors or host.\n\n\n\nMake sure to schedule meetings in advance. LinkedIn can be cringey, but announcing your attendance can help others plan to meet you.\n\n\n\nAt the event, take breaks often. Try to cushion your meetings with 3-5 minutes in between for notes and action items on the meeting and just to heal your introverted soul a little.\n\n\n\nThankfully the setting – despite its flaws sometimes – garners plenty of opportunity to step outside and do some deep breathing when it all becomes too much! Hang in there, you’ve got this!\n\n\n\nJeffrey Wheatman, SVP, Cyber Risk Strategist, Black Kite\nMake sure you set up your agenda in advance. It’s tempting to wait until the last minute to decide what you want to attend. That is a rookie mistake. Aside from the fact that it’s super overwhelming, the popular sessions get booked out.\n\n\n\nDon’t get too hung up on “tracks” – there are going to be sessions that are interesting but not in your track. Step outside your comfort zone\n\n\n\nIf you have time, see if the speakers have spoken elsewhere and check them out if you can – nothing worse than hitting a session and having the speaker be low energy or awkward.\n\n\n\nI usually skip sessions given by “circuit speakers” – they are everywhere, including YouTube\n\n\n\nMake sure you leave time to network and connect with friends and colleagues\n\n\n\nSkip the big parties – too crowded, too noisy, and why wait in line?\n\n\n\nDon’t party too hard the first few days.\n\n\n\nStrike a balance between big topics, niche sessions, and interactive content. One of the coolest sessions I’ve seen was a book club session.\n\n\n\nGet there a day early, if you can, especially if you are crossing multiple time zones.\n\n\n\nI’m grateful to those who pitched in for this guide and I hope it serves both newbies and oldies alike. I would add two things to this list. The first is something that my sales and marketing teams have heard from me for decades: “NO HUDDLING.” If you send a group, that group should divide and conquer rather than always be together. You will force multiply your outcomes. The second is, given the diverse network of attendees from CEOs, founders, venture capitalists, policy makers, security leaders and practitioners of all types, if you’re a vendor or trying to gain business, be sure to send folks who can have strategic conversations with any of those profiles and actively mentor those who can’t yet while they do it, as it will help better show the breadth of your expertise.\n\n\n\nRelated: Beyond the Buzz: Rethinking Alcohol as a Cybersecurity Bonding Ritual\n\nEquip and Prepare your team: Success at events starts before you even arrive. Ensure your team is well-prepared with a solid understanding of the key conversations you want to drive.\n\n\n\nPrioritize Quality over Quantity: Time is limited, and everyone is competing for attention. Focus on the depth of engagements rather than the sheer number of interactions. In my experience, some leaders measure event success by the number of scanned leads or demos. However, months later, many of these leads fizzle out. While big events help with overall brand awareness, meaningful impact from high-quality leads – those identified through early discovery, thoughtful planning, and active listening really help to move the needle and create trusting relationships in the long-run.\n\n\n\nIt’s ok to say no to someone if they are not a good fit for your product/solution, you don’t need to be everything to everyone. Trying to appeal to everyone dilutes your differentiation, and prospects/customers can sense that.\n\n\n\nLead With Intention: Approach every aspect of the event with purpose, from booth design and messaging to the content you share and the conversations you engage in. Events are what you make of them. They offer rare opportunities to build relationships that may not happen otherwise—so make every interaction count.\n\n\n\nCasey Ellis, Founder and Advisor, Bugcrowd\nPlan with Purpose: Decide on one or two key goals for the week – Whether it’s meeting people, attending certain talks, or diving into a particular topic in the villages. Conferences like RSAC are overwhelming, so having a focus and sticking to it will help you prioritize and avoid burnout.\n\n\n\nBig Rocks First: I’ll tend to go into a conference with key talks that I want to catch, events to attend, and people that I absolutely don’t want to miss. The trick here is to keep this list small and organize everything else around filling in the gaps.\n\n\n\nOptimize for Serendipity: Some of the best connections and conversations happen outside the formal sessions. Make time to walk the expo floor, chat with vendors, and strike up conversations in lounges or nearby hotel lobbies. For me, the most valuable thing about RSAC is the community.\n\n\n\nHave a Wingperson: Know who of your peers and friends will be there and try to have one or two people that you’re “doing the conference with” – This helps keep you on-track, and can be incredible for making sure that you, and they, are looking after themselves.\n\n\n\nBalance Work and Rest: Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. Schedule downtime to recharge – Whether it’s a quiet dinner with friends, a walk down by the Embarcadero, or a little time to stare at a wall in your hotel room. You’ll be more effective and present for the rest of the week.\n\n\n\nChris Eng, Cybersecurity Consultant and Advisor\nBe cognizant of the need to recharge and build downtime into your day.

The second is, given the diverse network of attendees from CEOs, founders, venture capitalists, policy makers, security leaders and practitioners of all types, if you’re a vendor or trying to gain business, be sure to send folks who can have strategic conversations with any of those profiles and actively mentor those who can’t yet while they do it, as it will help better show the breadth of your expertise.\n\n\n\nRelated: Beyond the Buzz: Rethinking Alcohol as a Cybersecurity Bonding Ritual\n\nIt’s ok to say no to someone if they are not a good fit for your product/solution, you don’t need to be everything to everyone.

Events are what you make of them. They offer rare opportunities to build relationships that may not happen otherwise—so make every interaction count.\n\n\n\nCasey Ellis, Founder and Advisor, Bugcrowd\nPlan with Purpose: Decide on one or two key goals for the week – Whether it’s meeting people, attending certain talks, or diving into a particular topic in the villages. Conferences like RSAC are overwhelming, so having a focus and sticking to it will help you prioritize and avoid burnout.\n\n\n\nBig Rocks First: I’ll tend to go into a conference with key talks that I want to catch, events to attend, and people that I absolutely don’t want to miss. The trick here is to keep this list small and organize everything else around filling in the gaps.\n\n\n\nOptimize for Serendipity: Some of the best connections and conversations happen outside the formal sessions. Make time to walk the expo floor, chat with vendors, and strike up conversations in lounges or nearby hotel lobbies. For me, the most valuable thing about RSAC is the community.\n\n\n\nHave a Wingperson: Know who of your peers and friends will be there and try to have one or two people that you’re “doing the conference with” – This helps keep you on-track, and can be incredible for making sure that you, and they, are looking after themselves.\n\n\n\nBalance Work and Rest: Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint.

You’ll be more effective and present for the rest of the week.\n\n\n\nChris Eng, Cybersecurity Consultant and Advisor\nBe cognizant of the need to recharge and build downtime into your day. For example, I often go sit on a bench in Yerba Buena and enjoy lunch by myself, which helps me regenerate energy for the afternoon. Similarly, an hour in the hotel room before going out to evening events work wonders.\n\n\n\nBe clear on your goals for the event, whether it’s exploring career prospects, getting feedback on an idea, learning more about certain topics, meeting specific people, and so on. This will help you prioritize when there are overlapping options to pick from.\n\n\n\nDon’t oversubscribe to parties and happy hours. Turn FOMO into JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) and prioritize quality time with small groups of friends/colleagues. Conversations at a 4- to 6-person dinner can be so much more fulfilling, especially in contrast with the dozens of 2-minute interactions you’ve had all day long.\n\n\n\nSome large events are unavoidable, of course. Pair up with extroverted friends who will bear the brunt of the small talk and “people-ing”. Practice conversational exits so you can easily move on.\n\n\n\nAfter an interesting conversation with someone new, jot down some quick notes. Use those notes to add context when you connect with the person later on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nBronwen Hudson, Marketing Lead, RevealRisk\nLesson 1: You will always have FOMO. Accept it as part of the experience. My best advice? Make choices that keep your boundaries intact regardless of the pressure to party, to drink, to take swag, and so on.\n\n\n\nLesson 2: If you’re involved with a booth, make friends with a couple of event staff ASAP. Thank them, offer them a swag item, have a chat and a joke. Later, it is almost guaranteed they will save your life in some way or another (with an extension cord or a drill in all likelihood).\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Make a bag of booth essentials:\n\n\n\n\nMints, or those Listerine strips are best (no gum).\nNew travel sized deodorant and/or body spray (for you or others).\nLip balm.

You’re going to be FINE!\n\n\n\nJohn Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence, Trellix\nAs a seasoned RSA Conference attendee (and someone giving a keynote this year), let me share a few practical tips that go beyond the usual advice.\n\n\n\nFirst, if your schedule allows it, start each morning with a brief workout—this jump-starts your energy and mental clarity for the busy day ahead. Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy!

The trick here is to keep this list small and organize everything else around filling in the gaps.\n\n\n\nOptimize for Serendipity: Some of the best connections and conversations happen outside the formal sessions.

Schedule downtime to recharge – Whether it’s a quiet dinner with friends, a walk down by the Embarcadero, or a little time to stare at a wall in your hotel room. You’ll be more effective and present for the rest of the week.\n\n\n\nChris Eng, Cybersecurity Consultant and Advisor\nBe cognizant of the need to recharge and build downtime into your day. For example, I often go sit on a bench in Yerba Buena and enjoy lunch by myself, which helps me regenerate energy for the afternoon. Similarly, an hour in the hotel room before going out to evening events work wonders.\n\n\n\nBe clear on your goals for the event, whether it’s exploring career prospects, getting feedback on an idea, learning more about certain topics, meeting specific people, and so on. This will help you prioritize when there are overlapping options to pick from.\n\n\n\nDon’t oversubscribe to parties and happy hours. Turn FOMO into JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) and prioritize quality time with small groups of friends/colleagues. Conversations at a 4- to 6-person dinner can be so much more fulfilling, especially in contrast with the dozens of 2-minute interactions you’ve had all day long.\n\n\n\nSome large events are unavoidable, of course. Pair up with extroverted friends who will bear the brunt of the small talk and “people-ing”. Practice conversational exits so you can easily move on.\n\n\n\nAfter an interesting conversation with someone new, jot down some quick notes. Use those notes to add context when you connect with the person later on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nBronwen Hudson, Marketing Lead, RevealRisk\nLesson 1: You will always have FOMO. Accept it as part of the experience. My best advice? Make choices that keep your boundaries intact regardless of the pressure to party, to drink, to take swag, and so on.\n\n\n\nLesson 2: If you’re involved with a booth, make friends with a couple of event staff ASAP. Thank them, offer them a swag item, have a chat and a joke. Later, it is almost guaranteed they will save your life in some way or another (with an extension cord or a drill in all likelihood).\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Make a bag of booth essentials:\n\n\n\n\nMints, or those Listerine strips are best (no gum).\nNew travel sized deodorant and/or body spray (for you or others).\nLip balm.

You’re going to be FINE!\n\n\n\nJohn Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence, Trellix\nAs a seasoned RSA Conference attendee (and someone giving a keynote this year), let me share a few practical tips that go beyond the usual advice.\n\n\n\nFirst, if your schedule allows it, start each morning with a brief workout—this jump-starts your energy and mental clarity for the busy day ahead. Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy! Your brain gets bombarded from all sides – noisy vendor booths, non-stop meetings, and after-hours events that somehow feel mandatory. It’s a lot.\n\n\n\nWhen it all gets too much, try these quick sanity-savers:\n\n\n\n\nSneak in some deep breaths between sessions (nobody will notice!)\nFind a quiet spot for a quick mental reset when you’re about to snap\nUse your walks between venues to clear your head\nDon’t cram your schedule – give yourself breathing room\nDecide what actually matters each morning before the chaos starts\nKeep water and snacks handy (conference hunger is real and so is getting hangry!)\nHave one place for all your notes so ideas don’t vanish\nPack noise-canceling headphones for instant peace\nScout out a couple “escape spots” away from the madness\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 trick: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste, to help ground you\n\nThese little mental breaks will help you handle the constant switching without completely short-circuiting!\n\n\n\nFernando Montenegro, Vice President and Practice Lead, Cybersecurity, The Futurum GroupHave a plan: You can spend time roaming expo floor, watching talks, chatting up with strangers, reconnecting with friends from industry, checking in with your vendors, hanging out hallway-con-style, doing research on a particular topic, attending adjacent breakfast/lunch/happy hour/dinner events, and more. All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it. As a rule of thumb, assume a minimum 15 minutes between events.\n\n\n\nMany talks either fill to capacity quickly or have long queues to enter. Plan accordingly, consider pre-registering if that is an option.\n\n\n\nDo you REALLY want that swag? Personal preference, of course, but generic expo floor swag is, well, generic.\n\n\n\nKeep an open mind: The conference brings together all types of people, from newbies to veterans and everything in between, including investors, marketers, policy people, and more. Be open to different viewpoints, be respectful, and have a wonderful time!\n\n\n\nMariana Padilla, Co-Founder and CEO of HACKERverse.ai\nEvery three hours or so, I like to find a quiet corner in Moscone to reset. Listening to white noise or calming sounds helps clear my mind and prevent conference burnout.\n\n\n\nLarge afterparties may be exciting, but unless you’re just there to booze it up, they rarely offer decent networking opportunities. Instead, focus on smaller, more curated gatherings, where real connections are made.\n\n\n\nBe authentic in conversations—genuinely listen to what others are working on, rather than just pitching yourself. Long-term relationships drive success in cybersecurity, so think beyond just this event.\n\n\n\nStart reaching out NOW to the key people you want to meet before schedules fill up.\n\n\n\nDon’t overdo it with the free caffeine available on the expo floor. Too much caffeine late in the day keeps me up and prevents a good night of sleep. There’s nothing worse than sleeping poorly during an important conference.\n\n\n\nLastly, follow up in real-time—sending a quick LinkedIn message or email while the conversation is fresh will set you apart.\n\n\n\nJen VanAntwerp, Owner at JVAN Consulting and Founder at Sober in Cyber\nI travel with a heating pad, as well as icy hot patches that can be worn under my clothes if I start to ache after running around all day. If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break. To enjoy a power break, take your shoes off, lay on the bed facing the opposite direction, scoot your too shy close to the headboard, and rest your legs at around a 90° angle. This is also a great time to place that heating pad under your lower back.\n\n\n\nAfter even just a 10-minute power break, I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the day. Before going to bed, jot down a list of the people you’ve met, the things you’ve discussed, and any information you’ll need for follow-ups.\n\n\n\nI take a picture of any business cards I’ve been given before placing them in my pocket or bag (which saved my bacon once when I accidentally put some cards through the laundry!).\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying not to drink, always have a non-alcoholic beverage in your hand. That cuts down on the number of people who might ask, “whatcha drinking?”.\n\n\n\nGianna Whitver, Co-Founder and CEO, Cybersecurity Marketing SocietyRSAC Conference is the biggest networking opportunity of the year. Everyone is there: CEOs to security practitioners to investors. It’s your best time to network…as long as you don’t burn out!\n\n\n\nSign up for the parties early (like now!) – skip the big blowouts and attend some of the smaller, intimate ones. Reach out to advance to the party sponsors or host.\n\n\n\nMake sure to schedule meetings in advance. LinkedIn can be cringey, but announcing your attendance can help others plan to meet you.\n\n\n\nAt the event, take breaks often. Try to cushion your meetings with 3-5 minutes in between for notes and action items on the meeting and just to heal your introverted soul a little.\n\n\n\nThankfully the setting – despite its flaws sometimes – garners plenty of opportunity to step outside and do some deep breathing when it all becomes too much! Hang in there, you’ve got this!\n\n\n\nJeffrey Wheatman, SVP, Cyber Risk Strategist, Black Kite\nMake sure you set up your agenda in advance. It’s tempting to wait until the last minute to decide what you want to attend. That is a rookie mistake. Aside from the fact that it’s super overwhelming, the popular sessions get booked out.\n\n\n\nDon’t get too hung up on “tracks” – there are going to be sessions that are interesting but not in your track. Step outside your comfort zone\n\n\n\nIf you have time, see if the speakers have spoken elsewhere and check them out if you can – nothing worse than hitting a session and having the speaker be low energy or awkward.\n\n\n\nI usually skip sessions given by “circuit speakers” – they are everywhere, including YouTube\n\n\n\nMake sure you leave time to network and connect with friends and colleagues\n\n\n\nSkip the big parties – too crowded, too noisy, and why wait in line?\n\n\n\nDon’t party too hard the first few days.\n\n\n\nStrike a balance between big topics, niche sessions, and interactive content. One of the coolest sessions I’ve seen was a book club session.\n\n\n\nGet there a day early, if you can, especially if you are crossing multiple time zones.\n\n\n\nI’m grateful to those who pitched in for this guide and I hope it serves both newbies and oldies alike. I would add two things to this list. The first is something that my sales and marketing teams have heard from me for decades: “NO HUDDLING.” If you send a group, that group should divide and conquer rather than always be together.

The second is, given the diverse network of attendees from CEOs, founders, venture capitalists, policy makers, security leaders and practitioners of all types, if you’re a vendor or trying to gain business, be sure to send folks who can have strategic conversations with any of those profiles and actively mentor those who can’t yet while they do it, as it will help better show the breadth of your expertise.\n\n\n\nRelated: Beyond the Buzz: Rethinking Alcohol as a Cybersecurity Bonding Ritual\n\nPlan with Purpose: Decide on one or two key goals for the week – Whether it’s meeting people, attending certain talks, or diving into a particular topic in the villages.

I would add two things to this list. The first is something that my sales and marketing teams have heard from me for decades: “NO HUDDLING.” If you send a group, that group should divide and conquer rather than always be together. You will force multiply your outcomes. The second is, given the diverse network of attendees from CEOs, founders, venture capitalists, policy makers, security leaders and practitioners of all types, if you’re a vendor or trying to gain business, be sure to send folks who can have strategic conversations with any of those profiles and actively mentor those who can’t yet while they do it, as it will help better show the breadth of your expertise.\n\n\n\nRelated: Beyond the Buzz: Rethinking Alcohol as a Cybersecurity Bonding Ritual\n\nOptimize for Serendipity: Some of the best connections and conversations happen outside the formal sessions. Make time to walk the expo floor, chat with vendors, and strike up conversations in lounges or nearby hotel lobbies. For me, the most valuable thing about RSAC is the community.\n\n\n\nHave a Wingperson: Know who of your peers and friends will be there and try to have one or two people that you’re “doing the conference with” – This helps keep you on-track, and can be incredible for making sure that you, and they, are looking after themselves.\n\n\n\nBalance Work and Rest: Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. Schedule downtime to recharge – Whether it’s a quiet dinner with friends, a walk down by the Embarcadero, or a little time to stare at a wall in your hotel room. You’ll be more effective and present for the rest of the week.\n\n\n\nChris Eng, Cybersecurity Consultant and Advisor\nBe cognizant of the need to recharge and build downtime into your day. For example, I often go sit on a bench in Yerba Buena and enjoy lunch by myself, which helps me regenerate energy for the afternoon. Similarly, an hour in the hotel room before going out to evening events work wonders.\n\n\n\nBe clear on your goals for the event, whether it’s exploring career prospects, getting feedback on an idea, learning more about certain topics, meeting specific people, and so on. This will help you prioritize when there are overlapping options to pick from.\n\n\n\nDon’t oversubscribe to parties and happy hours. Turn FOMO into JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) and prioritize quality time with small groups of friends/colleagues. Conversations at a 4- to 6-person dinner can be so much more fulfilling, especially in contrast with the dozens of 2-minute interactions you’ve had all day long.\n\n\n\nSome large events are unavoidable, of course. Pair up with extroverted friends who will bear the brunt of the small talk and “people-ing”. Practice conversational exits so you can easily move on.\n\n\n\nAfter an interesting conversation with someone new, jot down some quick notes. Use those notes to add context when you connect with the person later on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nBronwen Hudson, Marketing Lead, RevealRisk\nLesson 1: You will always have FOMO. Accept it as part of the experience. My best advice? Make choices that keep your boundaries intact regardless of the pressure to party, to drink, to take swag, and so on.\n\n\n\nLesson 2: If you’re involved with a booth, make friends with a couple of event staff ASAP. Thank them, offer them a swag item, have a chat and a joke. Later, it is almost guaranteed they will save your life in some way or another (with an extension cord or a drill in all likelihood).\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Make a bag of booth essentials:\n\n\n\n\nMints, or those Listerine strips are best (no gum).\nNew travel sized deodorant and/or body spray (for you or others).\nLip balm. Buy a pack of six and you’ll be a hero, too.\nStationery kit: Sharpies, pair of scissors, roll of packing tape. These will be your friends at the end of the show!\n\nWhen in doubt, take two deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. You’re going to be FINE!\n\n\n\nJohn Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence, Trellix\nAs a seasoned RSA Conference attendee (and someone giving a keynote this year), let me share a few practical tips that go beyond the usual advice.\n\n\n\nFirst, if your schedule allows it, start each morning with a brief workout—this jump-starts your energy and mental clarity for the busy day ahead. Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy! Your brain gets bombarded from all sides – noisy vendor booths, non-stop meetings, and after-hours events that somehow feel mandatory. It’s a lot.\n\n\n\nWhen it all gets too much, try these quick sanity-savers:\n\n\n\n\nSneak in some deep breaths between sessions (nobody will notice!)\nFind a quiet spot for a quick mental reset when you’re about to snap\nUse your walks between venues to clear your head\nDon’t cram your schedule – give yourself breathing room\nDecide what actually matters each morning before the chaos starts\nKeep water and snacks handy (conference hunger is real and so is getting hangry!)\nHave one place for all your notes so ideas don’t vanish\nPack noise-canceling headphones for instant peace\nScout out a couple “escape spots” away from the madness\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 trick: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste, to help ground you\n\nThese little mental breaks will help you handle the constant switching without completely short-circuiting!\n\n\n\nFernando Montenegro, Vice President and Practice Lead, Cybersecurity, The Futurum GroupHave a plan: You can spend time roaming expo floor, watching talks, chatting up with strangers, reconnecting with friends from industry, checking in with your vendors, hanging out hallway-con-style, doing research on a particular topic, attending adjacent breakfast/lunch/happy hour/dinner events, and more. All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it. As a rule of thumb, assume a minimum 15 minutes between events.\n\n\n\nMany talks either fill to capacity quickly or have long queues to enter. Plan accordingly, consider pre-registering if that is an option.\n\n\n\nDo you REALLY want that swag?

Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy! Your brain gets bombarded from all sides – noisy vendor booths, non-stop meetings, and after-hours events that somehow feel mandatory. It’s a lot.\n\n\n\nWhen it all gets too much, try these quick sanity-savers:\n\n\n\n\nSneak in some deep breaths between sessions (nobody will notice!)\nFind a quiet spot for a quick mental reset when you’re about to snap\nUse your walks between venues to clear your head\nDon’t cram your schedule – give yourself breathing room\nDecide what actually matters each morning before the chaos starts\nKeep water and snacks handy (conference hunger is real and so is getting hangry!)\nHave one place for all your notes so ideas don’t vanish\nPack noise-canceling headphones for instant peace\nScout out a couple “escape spots” away from the madness\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 trick: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste, to help ground you\n\nThese little mental breaks will help you handle the constant switching without completely short-circuiting!\n\n\n\nFernando Montenegro, Vice President and Practice Lead, Cybersecurity, The Futurum GroupHave a plan: You can spend time roaming expo floor, watching talks, chatting up with strangers, reconnecting with friends from industry, checking in with your vendors, hanging out hallway-con-style, doing research on a particular topic, attending adjacent breakfast/lunch/happy hour/dinner events, and more. All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it. As a rule of thumb, assume a minimum 15 minutes between events.\n\n\n\nMany talks either fill to capacity quickly or have long queues to enter. Plan accordingly, consider pre-registering if that is an option.\n\n\n\nDo you REALLY want that swag? Personal preference, of course, but generic expo floor swag is, well, generic.\n\n\n\nKeep an open mind: The conference brings together all types of people, from newbies to veterans and everything in between, including investors, marketers, policy people, and more. Be open to different viewpoints, be respectful, and have a wonderful time!\n\n\n\nMariana Padilla, Co-Founder and CEO of HACKERverse.ai\nEvery three hours or so, I like to find a quiet corner in Moscone to reset. Listening to white noise or calming sounds helps clear my mind and prevent conference burnout.\n\n\n\nLarge afterparties may be exciting, but unless you’re just there to booze it up, they rarely offer decent networking opportunities. Instead, focus on smaller, more curated gatherings, where real connections are made.\n\n\n\nBe authentic in conversations—genuinely listen to what others are working on, rather than just pitching yourself. Long-term relationships drive success in cybersecurity, so think beyond just this event.\n\n\n\nStart reaching out NOW to the key people you want to meet before schedules fill up.\n\n\n\nDon’t overdo it with the free caffeine available on the expo floor. Too much caffeine late in the day keeps me up and prevents a good night of sleep. There’s nothing worse than sleeping poorly during an important conference.\n\n\n\nLastly, follow up in real-time—sending a quick LinkedIn message or email while the conversation is fresh will set you apart.\n\n\n\nJen VanAntwerp, Owner at JVAN Consulting and Founder at Sober in Cyber\nI travel with a heating pad, as well as icy hot patches that can be worn under my clothes if I start to ache after running around all day. If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break. To enjoy a power break, take your shoes off, lay on the bed facing the opposite direction, scoot your too shy close to the headboard, and rest your legs at around a 90° angle. This is also a great time to place that heating pad under your lower back.\n\n\n\nAfter even just a 10-minute power break, I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the day. Before going to bed, jot down a list of the people you’ve met, the things you’ve discussed, and any information you’ll need for follow-ups.\n\n\n\nI take a picture of any business cards I’ve been given before placing them in my pocket or bag (which saved my bacon once when I accidentally put some cards through the laundry!).\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying not to drink, always have a non-alcoholic beverage in your hand. That cuts down on the number of people who might ask, “whatcha drinking?”.\n\n\n\nGianna Whitver, Co-Founder and CEO, Cybersecurity Marketing SocietyRSAC Conference is the biggest networking opportunity of the year. Everyone is there: CEOs to security practitioners to investors. It’s your best time to network…as long as you don’t burn out!\n\n\n\nSign up for the parties early (like now!) – skip the big blowouts and attend some of the smaller, intimate ones. Reach out to advance to the party sponsors or host.\n\n\n\nMake sure to schedule meetings in advance. LinkedIn can be cringey, but announcing your attendance can help others plan to meet you.\n\n\n\nAt the event, take breaks often. Try to cushion your meetings with 3-5 minutes in between for notes and action items on the meeting and just to heal your introverted soul a little.\n\n\n\nThankfully the setting – despite its flaws sometimes – garners plenty of opportunity to step outside and do some deep breathing when it all becomes too much! Hang in there, you’ve got this!\n\n\n\nJeffrey Wheatman, SVP, Cyber Risk Strategist, Black Kite\nMake sure you set up your agenda in advance. It’s tempting to wait until the last minute to decide what you want to attend. That is a rookie mistake. Aside from the fact that it’s super overwhelming, the popular sessions get booked out.\n\n\n\nDon’t get too hung up on “tracks” – there are going to be sessions that are interesting but not in your track. Step outside your comfort zone\n\n\n\nIf you have time, see if the speakers have spoken elsewhere and check them out if you can – nothing worse than hitting a session and having the speaker be low energy or awkward.\n\n\n\nI usually skip sessions given by “circuit speakers” – they are everywhere, including YouTube\n\n\n\nMake sure you leave time to network and connect with friends and colleagues\n\n\n\nSkip the big parties – too crowded, too noisy, and why wait in line?\n\n\n\nDon’t party too hard the first few days.\n\n\n\nStrike a balance between big topics, niche sessions, and interactive content. One of the coolest sessions I’ve seen was a book club session.\n\n\n\nGet there a day early, if you can, especially if you are crossing multiple time zones.\n\n\n\nI’m grateful to those who pitched in for this guide and I hope it serves both newbies and oldies alike. I would add two things to this list. The first is something that my sales and marketing teams have heard from me for decades: “NO HUDDLING.” If you send a group, that group should divide and conquer rather than always be together. You will force multiply your outcomes. The second is, given the diverse network of attendees from CEOs, founders, venture capitalists, policy makers, security leaders and practitioners of all types, if you’re a vendor or trying to gain business, be sure to send folks who can have strategic conversations with any of those profiles and actively mentor those who can’t yet while they do it, as it will help better show the breadth of your expertise.\n\n\n\nRelated: Beyond the Buzz: Rethinking Alcohol as a Cybersecurity Bonding Ritual\n\nChris Eng, Cybersecurity Consultant and Advisor\nBe cognizant of the need to recharge and build downtime into your day. For example, I often go sit on a bench in Yerba Buena and enjoy lunch by myself, which helps me regenerate energy for the afternoon. Similarly, an hour in the hotel room before going out to evening events work wonders.\n\n\n\nBe clear on your goals for the event, whether it’s exploring career prospects, getting feedback on an idea, learning more about certain topics, meeting specific people, and so on. This will help you prioritize when there are overlapping options to pick from.\n\n\n\nDon’t oversubscribe to parties and happy hours. Turn FOMO into JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) and prioritize quality time with small groups of friends/colleagues. Conversations at a 4- to 6-person dinner can be so much more fulfilling, especially in contrast with the dozens of 2-minute interactions you’ve had all day long.\n\n\n\nSome large events are unavoidable, of course. Pair up with extroverted friends who will bear the brunt of the small talk and “people-ing”. Practice conversational exits so you can easily move on.\n\n\n\nAfter an interesting conversation with someone new, jot down some quick notes. Use those notes to add context when you connect with the person later on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nBronwen Hudson, Marketing Lead, RevealRisk\nLesson 1: You will always have FOMO. Accept it as part of the experience. My best advice? Make choices that keep your boundaries intact regardless of the pressure to party, to drink, to take swag, and so on.\n\n\n\nLesson 2: If you’re involved with a booth, make friends with a couple of event staff ASAP. Thank them, offer them a swag item, have a chat and a joke. Later, it is almost guaranteed they will save your life in some way or another (with an extension cord or a drill in all likelihood).\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Make a bag of booth essentials:\n\n\n\n\nMints, or those Listerine strips are best (no gum).\nNew travel sized deodorant and/or body spray (for you or others).\nLip balm. Buy a pack of six and you’ll be a hero, too.\nStationery kit: Sharpies, pair of scissors, roll of packing tape. These will be your friends at the end of the show!\n\nWhen in doubt, take two deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.

Later, it is almost guaranteed they will save your life in some way or another (with an extension cord or a drill in all likelihood).\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Make a bag of booth essentials:\n\n\n\n\nMints, or those Listerine strips are best (no gum).\nNew travel sized deodorant and/or body spray (for you or others).\nLip balm.

You’re going to be FINE!\n\n\n\nJohn Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence, Trellix\nAs a seasoned RSA Conference attendee (and someone giving a keynote this year), let me share a few practical tips that go beyond the usual advice.\n\n\n\nFirst, if your schedule allows it, start each morning with a brief workout—this jump-starts your energy and mental clarity for the busy day ahead. Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy! Your brain gets bombarded from all sides – noisy vendor booths, non-stop meetings, and after-hours events that somehow feel mandatory. It’s a lot.\n\n\n\nWhen it all gets too much, try these quick sanity-savers:\n\n\n\n\nSneak in some deep breaths between sessions (nobody will notice!)\nFind a quiet spot for a quick mental reset when you’re about to snap\nUse your walks between venues to clear your head\nDon’t cram your schedule – give yourself breathing room\nDecide what actually matters each morning before the chaos starts\nKeep water and snacks handy (conference hunger is real and so is getting hangry!)\nHave one place for all your notes so ideas don’t vanish\nPack noise-canceling headphones for instant peace\nScout out a couple “escape spots” away from the madness\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 trick: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste, to help ground you\n\nThese little mental breaks will help you handle the constant switching without completely short-circuiting!\n\n\n\nFernando Montenegro, Vice President and Practice Lead, Cybersecurity, The Futurum GroupHave a plan: You can spend time roaming expo floor, watching talks, chatting up with strangers, reconnecting with friends from industry, checking in with your vendors, hanging out hallway-con-style, doing research on a particular topic, attending adjacent breakfast/lunch/happy hour/dinner events, and more. All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it. As a rule of thumb, assume a minimum 15 minutes between events.\n\n\n\nMany talks either fill to capacity quickly or have long queues to enter. Plan accordingly, consider pre-registering if that is an option.\n\n\n\nDo you REALLY want that swag? Personal preference, of course, but generic expo floor swag is, well, generic.\n\n\n\nKeep an open mind: The conference brings together all types of people, from newbies to veterans and everything in between, including investors, marketers, policy people, and more. Be open to different viewpoints, be respectful, and have a wonderful time!\n\n\n\nMariana Padilla, Co-Founder and CEO of HACKERverse.ai\nEvery three hours or so, I like to find a quiet corner in Moscone to reset. Listening to white noise or calming sounds helps clear my mind and prevent conference burnout.\n\n\n\nLarge afterparties may be exciting, but unless you’re just there to booze it up, they rarely offer decent networking opportunities. Instead, focus on smaller, more curated gatherings, where real connections are made.\n\n\n\nBe authentic in conversations—genuinely listen to what others are working on, rather than just pitching yourself. Long-term relationships drive success in cybersecurity, so think beyond just this event.\n\n\n\nStart reaching out NOW to the key people you want to meet before schedules fill up.\n\n\n\nDon’t overdo it with the free caffeine available on the expo floor. Too much caffeine late in the day keeps me up and prevents a good night of sleep. There’s nothing worse than sleeping poorly during an important conference.\n\n\n\nLastly, follow up in real-time—sending a quick LinkedIn message or email while the conversation is fresh will set you apart.\n\n\n\nJen VanAntwerp, Owner at JVAN Consulting and Founder at Sober in Cyber\nI travel with a heating pad, as well as icy hot patches that can be worn under my clothes if I start to ache after running around all day. If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break. To enjoy a power break, take your shoes off, lay on the bed facing the opposite direction, scoot your too shy close to the headboard, and rest your legs at around a 90° angle. This is also a great time to place that heating pad under your lower back.\n\n\n\nAfter even just a 10-minute power break, I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the day. Before going to bed, jot down a list of the people you’ve met, the things you’ve discussed, and any information you’ll need for follow-ups.\n\n\n\nI take a picture of any business cards I’ve been given before placing them in my pocket or bag (which saved my bacon once when I accidentally put some cards through the laundry!).\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying not to drink, always have a non-alcoholic beverage in your hand. That cuts down on the number of people who might ask, “whatcha drinking?”.\n\n\n\nGianna Whitver, Co-Founder and CEO, Cybersecurity Marketing SocietyRSAC Conference is the biggest networking opportunity of the year. Everyone is there: CEOs to security practitioners to investors. It’s your best time to network…as long as you don’t burn out!\n\n\n\nSign up for the parties early (like now!) – skip the big blowouts and attend some of the smaller, intimate ones. Reach out to advance to the party sponsors or host.\n\n\n\nMake sure to schedule meetings in advance. LinkedIn can be cringey, but announcing your attendance can help others plan to meet you.\n\n\n\nAt the event, take breaks often. Try to cushion your meetings with 3-5 minutes in between for notes and action items on the meeting and just to heal your introverted soul a little.\n\n\n\nThankfully the setting – despite its flaws sometimes – garners plenty of opportunity to step outside and do some deep breathing when it all becomes too much! Hang in there, you’ve got this!\n\n\n\nJeffrey Wheatman, SVP, Cyber Risk Strategist, Black Kite\nMake sure you set up your agenda in advance. It’s tempting to wait until the last minute to decide what you want to attend. That is a rookie mistake. Aside from the fact that it’s super overwhelming, the popular sessions get booked out.\n\n\n\nDon’t get too hung up on “tracks” – there are going to be sessions that are interesting but not in your track. Step outside your comfort zone\n\n\n\nIf you have time, see if the speakers have spoken elsewhere and check them out if you can – nothing worse than hitting a session and having the speaker be low energy or awkward.\n\n\n\nI usually skip sessions given by “circuit speakers” – they are everywhere, including YouTube\n\n\n\nMake sure you leave time to network and connect with friends and colleagues\n\n\n\nSkip the big parties – too crowded, too noisy, and why wait in line?\n\n\n\nDon’t party too hard the first few days.\n\n\n\nStrike a balance between big topics, niche sessions, and interactive content. One of the coolest sessions I’ve seen was a book club session.\n\n\n\nGet there a day early, if you can, especially if you are crossing multiple time zones.\n\n\n\nI’m grateful to those who pitched in for this guide and I hope it serves both newbies and oldies alike. I would add two things to this list. The first is something that my sales and marketing teams have heard from me for decades: “NO HUDDLING.” If you send a group, that group should divide and conquer rather than always be together. You will force multiply your outcomes. The second is, given the diverse network of attendees from CEOs, founders, venture capitalists, policy makers, security leaders and practitioners of all types, if you’re a vendor or trying to gain business, be sure to send folks who can have strategic conversations with any of those profiles and actively mentor those who can’t yet while they do it, as it will help better show the breadth of your expertise.\n\n\n\nRelated: Beyond the Buzz: Rethinking Alcohol as a Cybersecurity Bonding Ritual\n\nDon’t oversubscribe to parties and happy hours. Turn FOMO into JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) and prioritize quality time with small groups of friends/colleagues. Conversations at a 4- to 6-person dinner can be so much more fulfilling, especially in contrast with the dozens of 2-minute interactions you’ve had all day long.\n\n\n\nSome large events are unavoidable, of course. Pair up with extroverted friends who will bear the brunt of the small talk and “people-ing”. Practice conversational exits so you can easily move on.\n\n\n\nAfter an interesting conversation with someone new, jot down some quick notes. Use those notes to add context when you connect with the person later on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nBronwen Hudson, Marketing Lead, RevealRisk\nLesson 1: You will always have FOMO.

If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break. To enjoy a power break, take your shoes off, lay on the bed facing the opposite direction, scoot your too shy close to the headboard, and rest your legs at around a 90° angle. This is also a great time to place that heating pad under your lower back.\n\n\n\nAfter even just a 10-minute power break, I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the day.

You will force multiply your outcomes. The second is, given the diverse network of attendees from CEOs, founders, venture capitalists, policy makers, security leaders and practitioners of all types, if you’re a vendor or trying to gain business, be sure to send folks who can have strategic conversations with any of those profiles and actively mentor those who can’t yet while they do it, as it will help better show the breadth of your expertise.\n\n\n\nRelated: Beyond the Buzz: Rethinking Alcohol as a Cybersecurity Bonding Ritual\n\nBronwen Hudson, Marketing Lead, RevealRisk\nLesson 1: You will always have FOMO.

If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break.

Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy!

All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it.

The second is, given the diverse network of attendees from CEOs, founders, venture capitalists, policy makers, security leaders and practitioners of all types, if you’re a vendor or trying to gain business, be sure to send folks who can have strategic conversations with any of those profiles and actively mentor those who can’t yet while they do it, as it will help better show the breadth of your expertise.\n\n\n\nRelated: Beyond the Buzz: Rethinking Alcohol as a Cybersecurity Bonding Ritual\n\nAs a seasoned RSA Conference attendee (and someone giving a keynote this year), let me share a few practical tips that go beyond the usual advice.\n\n\n\nFirst, if your schedule allows it, start each morning with a brief workout—this jump-starts your energy and mental clarity for the busy day ahead. Find a good breakfast place outside of the hustle and bustle to enjoy some of the fine food San Francisco has to offer. Plan your day with a balance of meaningful meetings; it’s easy to over schedule, but allowing buffer time ensures you can fully engage in conversations without feeling rushed.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of pacing yourself, it’s tempting to attend every party or after-hours event, but try to moderate your evening activities. This helps me maintain your stamina during sessions, discussions, and, of course, my mainstage keynote.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t underestimate the value of downtime—short breaks can rejuvenate you between sessions. By staying strategic and keeping your energy levels steady, you’ll make the most of your RSAC experience.\n\n\n\nMaria Graham, Senior Account Executive, Security and Networking Solutions, PDI Technologies\nLet’s be real – RSAC is crazy! Your brain gets bombarded from all sides – noisy vendor booths, non-stop meetings, and after-hours events that somehow feel mandatory. It’s a lot.\n\n\n\nWhen it all gets too much, try these quick sanity-savers:\n\n\n\n\nSneak in some deep breaths between sessions (nobody will notice!)\nFind a quiet spot for a quick mental reset when you’re about to snap\nUse your walks between venues to clear your head\nDon’t cram your schedule – give yourself breathing room\nDecide what actually matters each morning before the chaos starts\nKeep water and snacks handy (conference hunger is real and so is getting hangry!)\nHave one place for all your notes so ideas don’t vanish\nPack noise-canceling headphones for instant peace\nScout out a couple “escape spots” away from the madness\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 trick: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste, to help ground you\n\nThese little mental breaks will help you handle the constant switching without completely short-circuiting!\n\n\n\nFernando Montenegro, Vice President and Practice Lead, Cybersecurity, The Futurum GroupHave a plan: You can spend time roaming expo floor, watching talks, chatting up with strangers, reconnecting with friends from industry, checking in with your vendors, hanging out hallway-con-style, doing research on a particular topic, attending adjacent breakfast/lunch/happy hour/dinner events, and more. All are valid options, but which ones work for YOU? What do YOU want out of the event?\n\n\n\nInclude travel time between things: It’s rare that your next meeting/event/ is at the same place as your previous one or right next to it. As a rule of thumb, assume a minimum 15 minutes between events.\n\n\n\nMany talks either fill to capacity quickly or have long queues to enter. Plan accordingly, consider pre-registering if that is an option.\n\n\n\nDo you REALLY want that swag? Personal preference, of course, but generic expo floor swag is, well, generic.\n\n\n\nKeep an open mind: The conference brings together all types of people, from newbies to veterans and everything in between, including investors, marketers, policy people, and more. Be open to different viewpoints, be respectful, and have a wonderful time!\n\n\n\nMariana Padilla, Co-Founder and CEO of HACKERverse.ai\nEvery three hours or so, I like to find a quiet corner in Moscone to reset. Listening to white noise or calming sounds helps clear my mind and prevent conference burnout.\n\n\n\nLarge afterparties may be exciting, but unless you’re just there to booze it up, they rarely offer decent networking opportunities. Instead, focus on smaller, more curated gatherings, where real connections are made.\n\n\n\nBe authentic in conversations—genuinely listen to what others are working on, rather than just pitching yourself. Long-term relationships drive success in cybersecurity, so think beyond just this event.\n\n\n\nStart reaching out NOW to the key people you want to meet before schedules fill up.\n\n\n\nDon’t overdo it with the free caffeine available on the expo floor. Too much caffeine late in the day keeps me up and prevents a good night of sleep. There’s nothing worse than sleeping poorly during an important conference.\n\n\n\nLastly, follow up in real-time—sending a quick LinkedIn message or email while the conversation is fresh will set you apart.\n\n\n\nJen VanAntwerp, Owner at JVAN Consulting and Founder at Sober in Cyber\nI travel with a heating pad, as well as icy hot patches that can be worn under my clothes if I start to ache after running around all day. If there’s even just 15-20 minutes to spare, I head to my room for a “legs up“ power break. To enjoy a power break, take your shoes off, lay on the bed facing the opposite direction, scoot your too shy close to the headboard, and rest your legs at around a 90° angle. This is also a great time to place that heating pad under your lower back.\n\n\n\nAfter even just a 10-minute power break, I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the day. Before going to bed, jot down a list of the people you’ve met, the things you’ve discussed, and any information you’ll need for follow-ups.\n\n\n\nI take a picture of any business cards I’ve been given before placing them in my pocket or bag (which saved my bacon once when I accidentally put some cards through the laundry!).\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying not to drink, always have a non-alcoholic beverage in your hand. That cuts down on the number of people who might ask, “whatcha drinking?”.\n\n\n\nGianna Whitver, Co-Founder and CEO, Cybersecurity Marketing SocietyRSAC Conference is the biggest networking opportunity of the year.

Most tasks, they say, were completed on the first trial.Advertisement.

Open source models, where the user has complete control over input history, are most vulnerable.\n\n\n\n“It’s important to note, however, that systems which maintain conversation state on their servers—such as Copilot and ChatGPT —are not susceptible to this attack,” the researchers note.\n\n\n\nThe researchers propose server-side history maintenance, which ensures consistency and integrity, and implementation of digital signatures for conversations history as mitigations against CCA and similar attacks relying on the injection of malicious context.\n\n\n\nThese mitigations, they note, are primarily applicable to black-box models, while white-box models, need a “more involved defense strategy”, such as the integration of cryptographic signatures into the AI system’s input processing, to ensure that the model only accepts authenticated and unaltered context.\n\n\n\nRelated: DeepSeek Compared to ChatGPT, Gemini in AI Jailbreak Test\nRelated: ChatGPT Jailbreak: Researchers Bypass AI Safeguards Using Hexadecimal Encoding and Emojis\nRelated: Microsoft Details ‘Skeleton Key’ AI Jailbreak Technique\nRelated: In Other News: Fake Lockdown Mode, New Linux RAT, AI Jailbreak, Country’s DNS Hijacked\n\nCalled Context Compliance Attack (CCA), the method exploits a fundamental architectural vulnerability present within many deployed gen-AI solutions, subverting safeguards and enabling otherwise suppressed functionality.\n\n\n\n“By subtly manipulating conversation history, CCA convinces the model to comply with a fabricated dialogue context, thereby triggering restricted behavior,” Microsoft’s Mark Russinovich and Ahmed Salem explain in a research paper (PDF).\n\n\n\n“Our evaluation across a diverse set of open-source and proprietary models demonstrates that this simple attack can circumvent state-of-the-art safety protocols,” the researchers say.\n\n\n\nWhile other jailbreak methods targeting AI focus on crafted prompt sequences or prompt optimizations, CCA relies on inserting a manipulated conversation history in a dialogue on a sensitive topic and responding affirmatively to a fabricated question.\n\n\n\n“Convinced by the manipulated dialogue, the AI system generates output that adheres to the perceived conversational context, thereby breaching its safety constraints,” the researchers say.\n\n\n\nRussinovich and Salem tested CCA against multiple leading AI systems, including Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, various GPT models, Llama, Phi, and Yi, demonstrating that nearly all models are vulnerable, except for Llama-2.\n\n\n\nFor their evaluation, the researchers used 11 sensitive tasks corresponding to as many categories of potentially harmful content, and executed CCA in five independent trials.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nThe newly discovered SuperBlack ransomware has been exploiting two vulnerabilities in Fortinet firewalls.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nA Russian threat actor has been exploiting two Fortinet firewall vulnerabilities in attacks leading to ransomware deployments, cybersecurity firm Forescout warns.\nThe hacking group, tracked as Mora_001, apparently adopted a leaked LockBit builder to create its own file-encrypting ransomware variant that Forescout has dubbed SuperBlack.\n\n\n\nMora_001, the cybersecurity firm says, has ties to established ransomware gangs, based on its post-exploitation patterns, the use of the leaked builder, and the use of the same ID as LockBit for the peer-to-peer communication service Tox.\n\n\n\n“The post-exploitation patterns observed enabled us to define a unique operational signature that sets Mora_001 apart from other ransomware operators, including LockBit affiliates. This consistent operational framework suggests a distinct threat actor with a structured playbook,” Forescout notes.\n\n\n\nThe threat actor has been observed exploiting CVE-2024-55591 and CVE-2025-24472, two vulnerabilities in FortiOS and FortiProxy that allow attackers to elevate their privileges to super-admin on a vulnerable Fortinet appliance.\n\n\n\nFortinet announced patches for CVE-2024-55591 in January, warning of its in-the-wild exploitation as a zero-day. On February 11, the company updated its advisory to add CVE-2025-24472, which covers an additional attack vector.\n\n\n\nWithin four days after a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit targeting vulnerable FortiOS devices was published on January 27, Forescout observed Mora_001 employing it in attacks to create at least one local system admin user account.\n\n\n\n“In some cases, instead of relying on a single administrative account for all actions, the threat actor employed a chaining method, where each newly created administrative account was used to generate additional accounts,” Forescout explains.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nFollowing the local administrator account creation, the attackers downloaded the firewall configuration file, which contains critical information, modified system settings, and created a scripted automation task to recreate the super admin user if it was deleted.\n\n\n\nThe threat actor was also seen creating local VPN user accounts, attempting to log in to other firewalls, and abusing the built-in FortiGate dashboards for reconnaissance, likely looking for lateral movement paths.\n\n\n\nMora_001 focused on compromising high-value targets within the victims’ environments, such as servers and domain controllers, using WMIC for remote system discovery and SSH for access. The file-encrypting ransomware was executed only after data exfiltration was completed.\n\n\n\n“In one confirmed case, the attacker focused on identifying and compromising file servers, which became primary targets for data exfiltration and ransomware deployment. Instead of encrypting the entire network, the attacker selectively encrypted file servers containing sensitive data,” Forescout explains.\n\n\n\nCompared to LockBit 3.0, SuperBlack drops a modified ransom note and uses a different data exfiltration executable, but drops a wiper component previously associated with LockBit and BrainCipher. Dubbed WipeBlack, it removes evidence of the ransomware executable after encryption.\n\n\n\nRelated: Medusa Ransomware Made 300 Critical Infrastructure Victims\nRelated: Exploited VMware ESXi Flaws Put Many at Risk of Ransomware, Other Attacks\nRelated: Vulnerable Paragon Driver Exploited in Ransomware Attacks\nRelated: New Anubis Ransomware Could Pose Major Threat to Organizations\n\nThe hacking group, tracked as Mora_001, apparently adopted a leaked LockBit builder to create its own file-encrypting ransomware variant that Forescout has dubbed SuperBlack.\n\n\n\nMora_001, the cybersecurity firm says, has ties to established ransomware gangs, based on its post-exploitation patterns, the use of the leaked builder, and the use of the same ID as LockBit for the peer-to-peer communication service Tox.\n\n\n\n“The post-exploitation patterns observed enabled us to define a unique operational signature that sets Mora_001 apart from other ransomware operators, including LockBit affiliates.
