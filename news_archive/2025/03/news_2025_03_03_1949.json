        "Content": "Threat actors are targeting Amazon Web Services (\nAWS\n) environments to push out phishing campaigns to unsuspecting targets, according to findings from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42.\nThe cybersecurity company is tracking the activity cluster under the name\nTGR-UNK-0011\n(short for a\nthreat group with unknown motivation\n), which it said overlaps with a group known as JavaGhost. TGR-UNK-0011 is known to be active since 2019.\n\"The group focused historically on defacing websites,\" security researcher Margaret Kelley\nsaid\n. \"In 2022, they pivoted to sending out phishing emails for financial gain.\"\nIt's worth noting that these attacks do not exploit any vulnerability in AWS. Rather, the threat actors take advantage of misconfigurations in victims' environments that expose their AWS access keys in order to send phishing messages by abusing Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) and WorkMail services.\nIn doing so, the modus operandi offers the benefit of not having to host or pay for their own infrastructure to carry out the malicious activity.\nWhat's more, it enables the threat actor's phishing messages to sidestep email protections since the digital missives originate from a known entity from which the target organization has previously received emails.\n\"JavaGhost obtained exposed long-term access keys associated with identity and access management (IAM) users that allowed them to gain initial access to an AWS environment via the command-line interface (CLI),\" Kelley explained.\n\"Between 2022-24, the group evolved their tactics to more advanced defense evasion techniques that attempt to obfuscate identities in the\nCloudTrail logs\n. This tactic has historically been\nexploited by Scattered Spider\n.\"\nOnce access to the organization's AWS account is confirmed, the attackers are known to generate\ntemporary credentials\nand a login URL to\nallow console access\n. This, Unit 42 noted, grants them the ability to obfuscate their identity and gain visibility into the resources within the AWS account.\nSubsequently, the group has been observed utilizing SES and WorkMail to establish the phishing infrastructure, creating new SES and WorkMail users, and setting up new SMTP credentials to send email messages.\n\"Throughout the time frame of the attacks, JavaGhost creates various IAM users, some they use during their attacks and others that they never use,\" Kelley said. \"The unused IAM users seem to serve as long-term persistence mechanisms.\"\nAnother notable aspect of the threat actor's modus operandi concerns the creation of a new IAM role with a\ntrust policy attached\n, thereby permitting them to access the organization's AWS account from another AWS account under their control.\n\"The group continues to leave the same calling card in the middle of their attack by creating new Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) security groups named Java_Ghost, with the group description 'We Are There But Not Visible,'\" Unit 42 concluded.\n\"These security groups do not contain any security rules and the group typically makes no attempt to attach these security groups to any resources. The creation of the security groups appear in the CloudTrail logs in the CreateSecurityGroup events.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Attackers can exploit this flaw to escalate privileges.\nCVE-2025-0286\n- An arbitrary kernel memory write vulnerability in version 7.9.1 due to improper validation of user-supplied data lengths. This flaw can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.\nCVE-2025-0287\n- A null pointer dereference vulnerability in version 7.9.1 caused by the absence of a valid MasterLrp structure in the input buffer. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary kernel code, enabling privilege escalation.\nCVE-2025-0288\n- An arbitrary kernel memory vulnerability in version 7.9.1 caused by the memmove function, which fails to sanitize user-controlled input. This allows an attacker to write arbitrary kernel memory and achieve privilege escalation.\nCVE-2025-0289\n- An insecure kernel resource access vulnerability in version 17 caused by failure to validate the MappedSystemVa pointer before passing it to HalReturnToFirmware. This allows attackers to compromise the affected service.\nThe vulnerabilities have since been\naddressed\nby Paragon Software with version 2.0.0 of the driver, with the susceptible version of the driver added to\nMicrosoft's driver blocklist\n.\nThe development comes days after Check Point\nrevealed\ndetails of a large-scale malware campaign that leveraged another vulnerable Windows driver associated with Adlice's product suite (\"truesight.sys\") to bypass detection and deploy the Gh0st RAT malware.\nFound this article interesting?

Meanwhile, Microsoft pulled back the curtain on a scheme where cybercriminals used AI tools for harmful pranks, and a massive trove of live secrets was discovered, reminding us that even the tools we rely on can hide risky surprises.\nWe've sifted through a storm of cyber threats—from phishing scams to malware attacks—and broken down what it means for you in clear, everyday language. Get ready to dive into the details, understand the risks, and learn how to protect yourself in an increasingly unpredictable online world.\n⚡ Threat of the Week\nSerbian Youth Activist Targeted by Android 0-Day Exploit Chain\n— A 23-year-old Serbian youth activist had their Android phone\ntargeted\nby a zero-day exploit chain developed by Cellebrite to unlock the device and likely deploy an Android spyware called NoviSpy. The flaws combined CVE-2024-53104 with CVE-2024-53197 and CVE-2024-50302 to escalate privileges and achieve code execution. The vulnerabilities, originally present within the Linux kernel, were addressed in December 2024. CVE-2024-53104 has since been addressed in Android as of early February 2025. In response to the development, Cellebrite said it will no longer allow Serbia to use its software, stating \"we found it appropriate to stop the use of our products by the relevant customers at this time.\"\nThe CISO Guide to Detecting and Preventing Identity Attacks\nThis guide address the questions:\nHow much visibility does the security team have about identity-related activities and potential threats within your organization?\nWhat do cloud identity attacks look like across different cloud environments?\nWhat best practice strategies are available for detecting, preventing, and remediating identity-based attacks?\nPlus more!\nDownload ➝\n🔔 Top News\nMicrosoft Unmasks People Behind LLMjacking Scheme\n— Microsoft\nrevealed\nthe identities of four individuals who it said were behind an Azure Abuse Enterprise scheme that involves leveraging unauthorized access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) services in order to produce offensive and harmful content. The campaign, also referred to as LLMjacking, has targeted various AI service providers, with the threat actors selling the access to other criminal actors to facilitate the illicit generation of non-consensual intimate images of celebrities and other sexually explicit content in violation of its policies.\nCommon Crawl Dataset Contains Nearly 12,000 Live Secrets\n— An analysis of a December 2024 archive from Common Crawl has\nuncovered\nnearly 12,000 live secrets, once again highlighting how hard-coded credentials pose a severe security risk to users and organizations alike. Furthermore, they also have the unintended side effect of exacerbating a problem where large language models (LLMs) end up suggesting insecure coding practices to their users due to the presence of hard-coded credentials in training data.\nSilver Fox APT Uses Winos 4.0 to Target Taiwanese Orgs\n— Taiwanese companies have been\ntargeted\nvia phishing emails that masquerade as the country's National Taxation Bureau with an aim to deliver the Winos 4.0 (aka ValleyRAT) malware. Winos, derived from Gh0st RAT, is a modular malware framework that acts both as a remote access trojan and a command-and-control (C2) framework. The malware has also been propagated via trojanized installers for Philips DICOM viewers. A majority of these artifacts have been detected in the United States and Canada, indicating a possible expansion of the Silver Fox APT's targeting to new regions and sectors.\nAustralia Bans Kaspersky Products from Government Networks\n— Australia has become the latest country to\nban the installation of security software\nfrom Russian company Kaspersky, citing \"unacceptable security risk to Australian Government, networks and data.\" Under the new directive, government entities are prohibited from installing Kaspersky's products and web services on government systems and devices effective April 1, 2025. They have also been recommended to remove all existing instances by the cutoff date.\nBybit Hack Formally Attributed to Lazarus Group\n— The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group has been\nimplicated\nin the record-breaking hack of crypto exchange Bybit that led to the theft of $1.5 billion in digital assets. The attack has been attributed to a threat cluster dubbed TraderTraitor, which was previously behind the theft of cryptocurrency worth $308 million from cryptocurrency company DMM Bitcoin in May 2024. Further investigation has found that the hack was carried out by compromising one of the developer's machines associated with multisig wallet platform Safe{Wallet} which affected an account operated by Bybit. \"The Bybit attack mirrors North Korea's established tactics of targeting centralized crypto exchanges through methods such as phishing, supply chain compromises, and private key theft-strategies,\" TRM Labs\nsaid\n. An infrastructure analysis has also found that the threat actors registered a fake domain named bybit-assessment[.]com a few hours before the theft took place. Silent Push, which discovered the domain, told The Hacker News it found no information to tie the bogus domain to the actual hack itself. It's believed that the domain may have been set up as part of another related campaign codenamed Contagious Interview. The company also noted that the threat actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign are actively targeting various cryptocurrency companies such as Stripe, Coinbase, Binance, Block, Ripple, Robinhood, Tether, Circle, Kraken, Gemini, Polygon, Chainalysis, KuCoin, eToro, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Gate.io, Pantera Capital, Galaxy, Bitwise Asset Management, Bitwise Investments, BingX, Gauntlet, XY Labs, YouHodler, MatChain, Bemo, Barrowwise, Bondex, Halliday, Holidu, Hyphen Connect, and Windranger. \"Anyone applying for a job at one of these companies should be on the lookout for suspicious job offers or suspicious interview tactics,\" the company added.\n‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs\nYour go-to software could be hiding dangerous security flaws—don't wait until it's too late!

The two extensions have been downloaded nearly 9 million times cumulatively. It's believed that the malicious code was introduced in an update to the extensions, indicating either a supply chain attack or a compromise of the developer's account. Microsoft said it also banned the developer, who claimed the issues are caused by outdated Sanity.io dependency that \"looks compromised.\" Another developer\ncommented\n: \"After being targeted for a removal, the reasonable, good faith action that the developer should have taken would be to reach out to the VS Code team, putting himself at their disposal to address any issues they have identified. Instead, he created multiple different accounts in order to submit the same extensions in an attempt to circumvent the restrictions, and implicated the VS Code devs in a conspiracy to personally censor him.\"\nOver 49,000 Misconfigured Access Management Systems Flagged\n— New research has uncovered more than 49,000 misconfigured access management systems (AMS) across the world, specifically in construction, healthcare, education, manufacturing, oil, and government sectors. These misconfigurations expose personal data, employee photographs, biometric data, work schedules, payslips, and other sensitive information. They could also be abused to access buildings and compromise physical security. Italy, Mexico, and Vietnam have emerged as the top countries with the most exposures. \"These misconfigurations exposed highly sensitive personal information, including employee photographs, full names, identification numbers, access card details, biometric data, vehicle plate numbers, and in some cases, even complete work schedules and facility access histories,\" Modat\nsaid\n. \"Particularly concerning was the discovery of exposed biometric templates and facial recognition data in several modern access control systems, which could pose serious privacy risks if accessed by malicious actors.\"\nTelegram Remains the Top Platform for Cybercriminals\n— Despite\nnew commitments\nfrom Telegram, the messaging app continues to remain a hub for cybercriminal activity. Some of the other platforms that are gaining traction, according to Flare.io, include Discord, Signal, TOX, Session, and Element/Matrix. While Discord invite links were primarily found on forums like Nulled, Cracked, VeryLeaks, and DemonForums, Matrix and Element protocol based IDs were mainly found on drugs focused forums like RuTOR, RCclub, and BigBro. TOX and Jabber IDs were predominantly shared on XSS, CrdPro, BreachForums, and Exploit forums. \"Increased cooperation between Telegram and law enforcement has prompted discussions about alternative platforms, with Signal showing the most significant growth,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"Other messaging apps like Discord, TOX, Matrix, and Session play niche roles, often tied to specific cybercriminal activities or communities. Many threat actors use multiple messaging apps to ensure accessibility and redundancy in their communications.\"\nOpenSSF Releases Best Practices for Open-Source Projects\n— The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) released the Open Source Project Security Baseline (\nOSPS Baseline\n), a three-tiered set of requirements that aims to improve the security posture of open source software projects. \"The OSPS Baseline offers a tiered framework of security practices that evolve with project maturity. It compiles existing guidance from OpenSSF and other expert groups, outlining tasks, processes, artifacts, and configurations that enhance software development and consumption security,\" the OpenSSF\nsaid\n. \"By adhering to the Baseline, developers can lay a foundation that supports compliance with global cybersecurity regulations, such as the E.U. Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF).\" The development comes as Google\nissued calls\nfor standardizing\nmemory safety\nby \"establishing a common framework for specifying and objectively assessing memory safety assurances.\"\nMITRE Releases OCCULT Framework\n— The MITRE Corporation has detailed a lightweight operational evaluation framework called\nOCCULT\nthat allows cyber security experts to quantify the possible risks associated with a large language model (LLM) used in offensive cyber operations. \"The OCCULT objective is ultimately about understanding the cyber operation capacity of an AI system, and quantifying performance in these dimensions of cyber reasoning can provide insight into that,\" MITRE said.\nMichigan Man Indicted on Wire Fraud and Aggravated Identity Theft Charges\n— Andrew Shenkosky, a 29-year-old man from the U.S. state of Michigan, has been indicted on wire fraud and aggravated identity theft charges after purchasing 2,468 stolen login credentials from the dark web marketplace\nGenesis Market\nand using them to make fraudulent financial transactions. Shenkosky is also alleged to have offered some of the stolen account data for sale on other criminal forums, including the now-defunct Raid Forums. The scheme was devised and executed from approximately February 2020 to November 2020, the U.S. Justice Department\nsaid\n.\n16 Malicious Google Chrome Extensions Flagged\n— Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a cluster of at least\n16 malicious Chrome extensions\nthat were used to inject code into browsers to facilitate advertising and search engine optimization (SEO) fraud. The browser add-ons, now removed from the Chrome Web Store, collectively impacted 3.2 million users and masqueraded as screen capture tools, ad blockers, and emoji keyboards. According to GitLab, it's suspected that the threat actors acquired access to at least some of the extensions from their original developers to subsequently push out the trojanized versions. The activity has been ongoing since at least July 2024.\nGmail to Ditch SMS for Two-Factor Authentication\n— Google is planning to end support for SMS-based two-factor authentication in Gmail so as to \"reduce the impact of rampant, global SMS abuse.\" In lieu of the SMS-based system, the company is expected to display a QR code that users need to scan so as to login to their accounts, Forbes\nreported\n.\nDetails Emerge About NSA's Alleged Hack of China's Northwestern Polytechnical University\n— In 2022, China\naccused\nthe U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) of conducting a string of cyber attacks aimed at the Northwestern Polytechnical University. It said the attack targeting the research university employed no fewer than 40 different cyber weapons that are designed to siphon passwords, network equipment configuration, network management data, and operation and maintenance data. China has given the NSA the threat actor designation APT-C-40. According to a new analysis published by security researcher Lina Lau (aka \"inversecos\"), the\nattribution\nto the agency boils down to a combination of attack times (or lack thereof during Memorial Day and Independence Day holidays), hands-on keyboard activity using American English, human error, and the presence of tools previously discovered during the\nShadow Brokers leak\n. The attack involved the use of a zero-day vulnerability attack platform called Fox Acid to automate the delivery of browser-based exploits when visiting legitimate websites. Some of the other tools deployed included ISLAND for exploiting Solaris systems; SECONDDATE, a framework installed on edge devices to conduct network eavesdropping, MitM attacks, and code injection; NOPEN and FLAME SPRAY for remote access to compromised systems; CUNNING HERETICS, a lightweight implant for covert access to NSA communication channels; STOIC SURGEON, a backdoor targeting Linux, Solaris, JunOS, and FreeBSD systems; DRINKING TEA for credential harvesting; TOAST BREAD, a log manipulation tool that erased evidence of unauthorized access; and Shaver, a program to attack exposed SunOS servers for use as jump servers. It's said that NSA operatives stole classified research data, network infrastructure details, and sensitive operational documents from the university.\nApple Find My Exploit Can Turn a Bluetooth Device into an AirTag\n— A group of academics from George Mason University has detailed a new vulnerability in Apple's\nFind My network\ncalled nRootTag that turns devices into trackable \"AirTags\" without requiring root privileges. \"The attack achieves a success rate of over 90% within minutes at a cost of only a few U.S. dollars. Or, a\nrainbow table\ncan be built to search keys instantly,\" the researchers\nsaid\n. \"Subsequently, it can locate a computer in minutes, posing a substantial risk to user privacy and safety. The attack is effective on Linux, Windows, and Android systems, and can be employed to track desktops, laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices.\" Apple has released patches in iOS 18.2, iPadOS 17.7.3, 18.2, watchOS 11.2, tvOS 18.2, macOS Ventura 13.7.2, Sonoma 14.7.2, Sequoia 15.2, and visionOS 2.2 to fix the vulnerability. That said, the attack remains effective as long as unpatched iPhones or Apple Watches are in the proximity of a target device running a malicious trojan, which is capable of advertising Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) broadcasts that are used to glean a device's location by\nquerying Apple's servers\n. In other words, simply by installing malware that can send BLE advertisements, the technique can make the device it's running on trackable via Apple's Find My network.\nSwedish Authorities Seek Backdoor Access to Encrypted Messaging Apps\n— Sweden's law enforcement and security agencies are pushing for a legislation that forces encrypted messaging services like Signal and WhatsApp to create technical backdoors allowing them to access communications. Signal Foundation President Meredith Whittaker said the company would rather exit the market than complying with such a law, Swedish news outlet SVT Nyheter\nreported\nlast week. The development\nfollows\nApple's disabling of iCloud's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for users in the U.K. last week in response to reports that the Home Office had requested for the ability to access encrypted contents in the cloud. Tulsi Gabbard, the director of U.S. National Intelligence,\nsaid\nshe was not informed in advance about the U.K. government's demand to be able to access Apple customers' encrypted data. U.S. officials are said to be looking at whether the U.K. violated a bilateral agreement by demanding Apple create a \"backdoor\" to access end-to-end encrypted iCloud data,\naccording\nto Reuters. It also comes as concerns are being\nraised\nover a proposed amendment to the Narcotrafic law in France that seeks to backdoor encrypted messaging systems and hand over chat messages of suspected criminals within 72 hours of a law enforcement request. \"A backdoor for the good guys only is a dangerous illusion,\" Matthias Pfau, CEO of Tuta Mail, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. \"Weakening encryption for law enforcement inevitably creates vulnerabilities that can – and will – be exploited by cybercriminals and hostile foreign actors. This law would not just target criminals, it would destroy security for everyone.\"\nCybercriminal Behind More Than 90 Data Leaks Arrested\n— A joint operation of the Royal Thai Police and the Singapore Police Force has led to the arrest of an individual responsible for more than 90 instances of data leaks worldwide, including 65 in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region alone. The leaks resulted in the sale of over 13TB of personal data on the dark web, per Singaporean company Group-IB. The individual operated under various aliases ALTDOS, DESORDEN, GHOSTR, and 0mid16B. The identity of the suspect has not been disclosed, but Thai media\nreported\nthat he goes by the name Chingwei. \"The main goal of his attacks was to exfiltrate the compromised databases containing personal data and to demand payment for not disclosing it to the public,\" Group-IB\nsaid\n. \"If the victim refused to pay, he did not announce the leaks on dark web forums. Instead he notified the media or personal data protection regulators, with the aim of inflicting greater reputational and financial damage on his victims.\" In select instances, the threat actor also encrypted the victim's databases as a means of exerting more pressure. The attacks leveraged SQL injection tools like sqlmap and exploited vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers to gain unauthorized access, followed by deploying a cracked version of an adversary simulation tool named Cobalt Strike for controlling compromised servers and exfiltrating data. Targets of the individual's attacks spanned industries such as healthcare, retail, property investment, finance, e-commerce, logistics, technology, hospitality, insurance, and recruitment.\n🎥 Expert Webinar\nWebinar 1:\nDiscover How ASPM Bridges Critical Gaps in AppSec Before It's Too Late\n— Join our free webinar to learn how ASPM is changing app security.

Malware can hijack your clipboard to steal sensitive data, swap cryptocurrency addresses, or execute malicious commands without your knowledge. Tools like\nEdit Clipboard Contents\nTool allow you to inspect and modify clipboard data at a raw level, providing visibility into potential threats. Sysinternals Process Monitor (\nProcMon\n) can detect suspicious access to the clipboard, helping you catch rogue processes. Additional tools like\nInsideClipboard\nand\nClipboardic\nlog clipboard history and show all formats, revealing hidden malicious content that could otherwise go unnoticed.\nTo protect against clipboard-based attacks, use clipboard-clearing practices after copying sensitive data, and avoid pasting from untrusted sources. Developers should implement auto-clearing of clipboard data and sanitize pasted input to prevent exploits. Cybersecurity professionals can monitor clipboard access via\nSysmon\nor DLP systems to alert on suspicious behavior. By incorporating these tools and habits, you can better defend against clipboard hijacking and ensure sensitive information remains secure.\nConclusion\nAs we close this week's update, remember that staying informed is the first step to protecting yourself online. Every incident—from targeted exploits to AI misuse—shows that cyber threats are real and constantly changing.\nThank you for reading.

        "Content": "In 2024, global ransomware attacks hit 5,414, an 11% increase from 2023.\nAfter a slow start, attacks spiked in Q2 and surged in Q4, with 1,827 incidents (33% of the year's total). Law enforcement actions against major groups like LockBit caused fragmentation,\nleading to more competition and a rise in smaller gangs.\nThe number of active\nransomware\ngroups jumped 40%, from 68 in 2023 to 95 in 2024.\nNew Ransomware Groups to Watch\nIn 2023 there were just 27 new groups. 2024 saw a dramatic rise with 46 new groups detected. As the year went on the number of groups accelerated with Q4 2024 having 48 groups active.\nOf the 46 new ransomware groups in 2024, RansomHub became dominant, exceeding LockBit's activity. At Cyberint, now a Check Point Company, the research team is\nconstantly researching the latest ransomware groups\nand analyzing them for potential impact. This blog will look at 3 new players, the aforementioned RansomHub, Fog and Lynx and examine their impact in 2024 and delve into their origins and TTPs.\nTo learn about other new players download the 2024 Ransomware Report here.\nRansomhub\nRansomHub has emerged as the leading ransomware group in 2024, claiming 531 attacks on its Data Leak Site since commencing operations in Feb 2024. Following the FBI's disruption of\nALPHV\n, RansomHub is perceived as its 'spiritual successor,' potentially involving former affiliates.\nOperating as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), RansomHub enforces strict affiliate agreements, and RansomHub enforces strict adherence to affiliate agreements, with non-compliance resulting in bans and termination of partnerships. It offers a 90/10 ransom split, Affiliates/Core Group.\nWhile claiming a global hacker community, RansomHub avoids targeting CIS nations, Cuba, North Korea, China, and non-profits, exhibiting characteristics of a traditional Russian ransomware setup. Their avoidance of Russian-affiliated nations and overlap with other Russian ransomware groups in targeted companies further highlight their likely connections to Russia's cybercrime ecosystem.\nCyberint's August 2024\nfindings indicate a low payment rate: only 11.2% of victims paid (20 of 190), with negotiations often reducing demands. RansomHub prioritizes attack volume over payment rates, leveraging affiliate expansion to ensure profitability, with the goal of generating substantial revenue over time despite low individual payment success.\nMalware, Toolset & TTPS\nRansomHub's ransomware, developed in Golang and C++, targets Windows, Linux, and ESXi, distinguished by its fast encryption. Similarities to GhostSec's ransomware suggest a trend.\nRansomHub guarantees free decryption if affiliates fail to provide it post-payment or target prohibited organizations. Their ransomware encrypts data before exfiltration. Potential ties to\nALPHV\nare suggested by attack patterns, indicating similar tools and TTPs could be used.\nSophos research highlights parallels with Knight Ransomware, including Go-language payloads obfuscated with GoObfuscate and identical command-line menus.\nFog Ransomware\nFog ransomware appeared in early April 2024, targeting U.S. educational networks by exploiting stolen VPN credentials. They use a double-extortion strategy, publishing data on a TOR-based leak site if victims don't pay.\nIn 2024, they attacked 87 organizations globally. An Arctic Wolf report from November 2024 showed Fog initiated at least 30 intrusions, all via compromised SonicWall VPN accounts. Notably, 75% of these intrusions were linked to Akira, with the rest attributed to Fog, suggesting shared infrastructure and collaboration.\nFog primarily targets education, business services, travel, and manufacturing, with a focus on the U.S. Interestingly, Fog is one of the few ransomware groups that prioritize the education sector as their primary target.\nFog ransomware has demonstrated alarming speed, with the shortest observed time from initial access to encryption being just two hours. Its attacks follow a typical ransomware kill chain, encompassing network enumeration, lateral movement, encryption, and data exfiltration. Versions of the ransomware exist for both Windows and Linux platforms.\nIOCs\nType\nValue\nLast Observation Date\nIPv4-Addr\n107.161.50.26\nNov 28, 2024\nSHA-1\n507b26054319ff31f275ba44ddc9d2b5037bd295\nNov 28, 2024\nSHA-1\ne1fb7d15408988df39a80b8939972f7843f0e785\nNov 28, 2024\nSHA-1\n83f00af43df650fda2c5b4a04a7b31790a8ad4cf\nNov 28, 2024\nSHA-1\n44a76b9546427627a8d88a650c1bed3f1cc0278c\nNov 28, 2024\nSHA-1\neeafa71946e81d8fe5ebf6be53e83a84dcca50ba\nNov 28, 2024\nSHA-1\n763499b37aacd317e7d2f512872f9ed719aacae1\nNov 28, 2024\nSHA-1\n3477a173e2c1005a81d042802ab0f22cc12a4d55\nFeb 02, 2025\nSHA-1\n90be89524b72f330e49017a11e7b8a257f975e9a\nNov 28, 2024\nDomain-Name\ngfs302n515.userstorage.mega.co.nz\nNov 28, 2024\nSHA-256\ne67260804526323484f564eebeb6c99ed021b960b899ff788aed85bb7a9d75c3\nAug 20, 2024\nLynx\nLynx is a double-extortion ransomware group that has been very active lately, displaying many victimized companies on their website. They state that they avoid targeting government organizations, hospitals, non-profit groups, and other essential social sectors.\nOnce they gain access to a system, Lynx encrypts files, appending the \".LYNX\" extension. They then place a ransom note named \"README.txt\" in multiple directories.

        "Content": "Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Argentina, and Thailand have become the targets of a campaign that has infected Android TV devices with a botnet malware dubbed\nVo1d\n.\nThe improved variant of Vo1d has been found to encompass 800,000 daily active IP addresses, with the botnet scaling a peak of 1,590,299 on January 19, 2025, spanning 226 countries and regions. As of February 25, 2025, India has experienced a notable surge in infection rate, increasing from less than 1% (3,901) to 18.17% (217,771).\n\"Vo1d has evolved to enhance its stealth, resilience, and anti-detection capabilities,\" QiAnXin XLab\nsaid\n. \"RSA encryption secures network communication, preventing [command-and-control] takeover even if [the Domain Generation Algorithm] domains are registered by researchers. Each payload uses a unique Downloader, with XXTEA encryption and RSA-protected keys, making analysis harder.\"\nThe malware was\nfirst documented\nby Doctor Web in September 2024 as affecting Android-based TV boxes by means of a backdoor that's capable of downloading additional executables based on instructions issued by the command-and-control (C2) server.\nIt's not exactly clear how the compromises take place, although it's suspected to either involve some kind of a supply chain attack or the use of unofficial firmware versions with built-in root access.\nGoogle told The Hacker News at the time that the infected \"off-brand\" TV models were not Play Protect-certified Android devices and that they likely used source code from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code repository.\nThe latest iteration of the malware campaign shows that it's operating at a massive scale with an intent to facilitate the creation of a proxy network and activities like advertisement click fraud.\nXLab theorized that the rapid fluctuation in the botnet activity is likely due to its infrastructure being leased in specific regions to other criminal actors as part of what it said is a \"rental-return\" cycle where the bots are leased for a set time period to enable illegal operations, after which they join the larger Vo1d network.\nAn analysis of the newer version of the ELF malware (s63) has found that it's designed to download, decrypt, and execute a second-stage payload that's responsible for establishing communications with a C2 server.\nThe decrypted compressed package (ts01) contains four files: install.sh, cv, vo1d, and x.apk. It starts with the shell script launching the cv component, which, in turn, launches both vo1d and the Android app after installation.\nThe vo1d module's primary function is to decrypt and load an embedded payload, a backdoor that's capable of establishing communication with a C2 server and downloading and executing a native library.\n\"Its core functionality remains unchanged,\" XLab said. \"However, it has undergone significant updates to its network communication mechanisms, notably introducing a Redirector C2. The Redirector C2 serves to provide the bot with the real C2 server address, leveraging a hardcoded Redirector C2 and a large pool of domains generated by a DGA to construct an expansive network architecture.\"\nFor its part, the malicious Android app carries the package name \"com.google.android.gms.stable\" in what's a clear attempt to masquerade as the legitimate\nGoogle Play Services\n(\"com.google.android.gms\") to fly under the radar. It sets up persistence on the host by listening for the \"BOOT_COMPLETED\" event so that it automatically runs after each reboot.\nIt's also engineered to launch two other components that have a similar functionality as that of the vo1d module. The attack chain paves the way for the the deployment of a modular Android malware named Mzmess that incorporates for four different plugins -\nPopa (\"com.app.mz.popan\") and Jaguar (\"com.app.mz.jaguarn\") for proxy services\nLxhwdg (\"com.app.mz.lxhwdgn\"), whose purpose remains unknown due to its C2 server being offline\nSpirit (\"com.app.mz.spiritn\") for ad promotion and traffic inflation\nThe lack of infrastructural overlaps between Mzmess and Vo1d has raised the possibility that the threat behind the malicious activity may be renting the service to other groups.\n\"Currently, Vo1d is used for profit, but its full control over devices allows attackers to pivot to large-scale cyber attacks or other criminal activities [such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks],\" XLab said. \"Hackers could exploit them to broadcast unauthorized content.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A newly uncovered ClickFix phishing campaign is tricking victims into executing malicious PowerShell commands that deploy the Havok post-exploitation framework for remote access to compromised devices.\nClickFix is a social-engineering tactic that emerged last year, where threat actors create websites or phishing attachments that display fake errors and then prompt the user to click a button to fix them.\nClicking the button will copy a malicious PowerShell command into the Windows clipboard, which users are then prompted to paste into a command prompt to \"fix\" the error. However, as expected, the malicious PowerShell command will instead execute a script hosted on a remote site that downloads and installs malware on the devices.\nAbusing Microsoft cloud services\nIn a new ClickFix campaign discovered by\nFortinet's Fortiguard Labs\n, threat actors are sending phishing emails stating that a \"restricted notice\" is available to review and that recipients should open the attached HTML document ('Documents.html') to view it.\nWhen opened, the HTML displays a fake 0x8004de86 error, stating that it \"Failed to connect to the \"One Drive\" cloud service\" and that users must fix the error by updating the DNS cache manually.\nClickFix phishing attachment\nSource: BleepingComputer\nClicking the \"How to fix\" button will automatically copy a PowerShell command to the Windows clipboard and then display instructions on how to execute it.\nPhishing attachment displaying fix instructions\nSource: BleepingComputer\nThis PowerShell command will attempt to launch another PowerShell script hosted on the threat actor's SharePoint server.\nMalicious PowerShell command that was shared as a fix\nSource: BleepingComputer\nFortiguard says that the script checks whether the device is in a sandbox environment by querying the number of devices in the Windows domain. If it determines it's in a sandbox, the script will terminate.\nOtherwise, the script will modify the Windows Registry to add a value indicating that the script was run on the device. It will then proceed to check if Python is installed on the device and, if not, install the interpreter.\nFinally, a Python script is downloaded from the same SharePoint site and executed to deploy the\nHavok post-exploitation command and control framework\nas an injected DLL.\nHavoc is an open-source post-exploitation framework similar to Cobalt Strike, allowing attackers to remotely control compromised devices. Threat actors commonly use post-exploitation frameworks like Havoc to breach corporate networks and then spread laterally to other devices on the network.\nIn this campaign, Havok is configured to communicate back to the threat actor's services through Microsoft's Graph API, embedding malicious traffic within legitimate cloud services. By doing so, the attackers blend in with regular network communications to evade detection.\nThe malware uses SharePoint APIs on Microsoft Graph to send and receive commands, effectively transforming the attacker's SharePoint account into a data exchange system.\nClickFix attacks have become increasingly popular among cybercriminals, who use them to deploy a wide variety of malware, including\ninfostealers\n,\nDarkGate\n, and remote access trojans.\nThreat actors have also begun to evolve the technique to\nuse them on social media platforms like Telegram\n, where a fake identity verification service named 'Safeguard' was used to trick users into running PowerShell commands that install a Cobalt Strike beacon.\nRelated Articles:\nTelegram captcha tricks you into running malicious PowerShell scripts\nLearn Windows PowerShell and automation scripting with this $20 bundle\nEncryptHub breaches 618 orgs to deploy infostealers, ransomware\nRussian phishing campaigns exploit Signal's device-linking feature\nDarcula PhaaS can now auto-generate phishing kits for any brand"

At this stage, we are investigating whether there have been any infringements of data protection legislation,\" the\nICO said\n.\n\"If we find there is sufficient evidence that any of these companies have broken the law, we will put this to them and obtain their representations before reaching a final conclusion.\"\nThe privacy watchdog also\nfined TikTok £12.7 million\n($15.9 million) in April 2023 for data protection law breaches, including using data belonging to children under 13 without parental consent. In 2020, TikTok allowed up to 1.4 million young UK children to use its platform despite its rules preventing them from creating accounts.\nThe ICO is currently examining potential violations of data protection laws to ensure that companies create digital services that protect children's privacy. If it uncovers enough evidence of legal breaches by any of these companies, the ICO says it will work with them before making a final decision.\n\"My message is simple. If social media and video sharing platforms want to benefit from operating in the UK they must comply with data protection law,\" said John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner.\n\"The responsibility to keep children safe online lies firmly at the door of the companies offering these services and my office is steadfast in its commitment to hold them to account.\"\nA recent study published by the ICO found that\nover 42% of British parents\nfeel they have little or no control over the data video-sharing platforms and social media collect about their children.\nBleepingComputer contacted TikTok, Reddit, and Imgur for comments but did not hear back before publishing.\nRelated Articles:\nApple pulls iCloud end-to-end encryption feature in the UK\nUK domain registry Nominet confirms breach via Ivanti zero-day\nMicrosoft to remove the Location History feature in Windows\nNew WinRAR version strips Windows metadata to increase privacy\nX now blocks Signal contact links, flags them as malicious"

The company will also review the change management process to understand why the buggy change wasn't detected during testing.\nOngoing ​Exchange Online issues on iOS\nWhile Microsoft resolved the Microsoft 365 authentication problems over the weekend, another advisory published on the admin center\nstates\nthat Exchange Online users still have issues accessing their calendar entries and email messages using the iOS native mail app.\n\"Users may be able to click 'continue' when prompted and navigate back to re-entering their password to attempt to resolve impact. Additionally, some users may be able to bypass the prompt to sign-in by clicking 'edit settings' and then entering into the app,\" the company explained.\n\"We've so far been unable to identify any Microsoft service updates which we believe are contributing towards impact.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nAmazon claims its researchers have combined cat qubit technology and additional quantum error correction components onto a microchip that can be manufactured in a scalable fashion.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nFollowing Google’s Willow in December 2024, we now have two additional new quantum chips announced in the final week of February 2025: Microsoft’s Majorana 1, and now Amazon’s Ocelot. \n“AWS researchers,” claims Amazon, “have, for the first time, combined cat qubit technology and additional quantum error correction components onto a microchip that can be manufactured in a scalable fashion using processes borrowed from the microelectronics industry.”\n\n\n\nBackground to the new quantum chips\nThree new quantum chips from three separate quantum manufacturers in the space of three short months is a dramatic development. They all seek to solve the fundamental problem in quantum computing: the fragility of the quantum state is easily disrupted by the slightest environmental disturbance. The result is an intolerable level of processing errors.\n\n\n\nAny solution requires complex quantum error correction, which is currently considered the single biggest roadblock to developing a usable quantum computer – the traditional approach (if anything about quantum can be called traditional) is to increase the number of qubits.\n\n\n\nThe problem here is the sheer number of error-correcting qubits (which we can call physical qubits) that are needed to provide one working qubit (which we can call the logical qubit). In essence, this requires sharing information across many – very many – physical qubits to realize one logical qubit. It is the huge number of physical qubits necessary that hinders the development of scalable quantum computers. Error correction is a major part of the solution by greatly reducing the number of necessary physical qubits.\n\n\n\n“Quantum computing isn’t a one-size-fits-all technology,” comments Rebecca Krauthamer, founder and CEO at QuSecure. “There are multiple ways to build a quantum computer, each with different trade-offs.” Each of these new chips has taken a different approach to reducing quantum error; so, before looking at how Ocelot attempts to solve the quantum error problem, we should summarize the Willow and Majorana 1 approaches and compare them.\n\n\n\nWillow\nUsing superconducting qubits, comments Troy Nelson, CTO at Lastwall, “Willow has been able to reduce the error rate of both bit-flip and phase-flip errors by improving the way physical qubit measurements are taken.” \n\n\n\nMarc Manzano, general manager of cybersecurity at SandboxAQ, adds, “With its focus on improved qubit coherence and reduced error rates, Google’s Willow aims to reduce errors as the number of qubits scales.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nGoogle confirmed this in its December announcement: “Using our latest advances in quantum error correction, we were able to cut the error rate in half. In other words, we achieved an exponential reduction in the error rate.” \n\n\n\nIt claims to have achieved ‘below threshold’ for its error corrections, where ‘threshold’ is a theoretical level for error rates. Being below threshold means it is possible to build arbitrarily large quantum computers.\n\n\n\nFor more on the Willow chip, see Google’s Willow Chip Signals the Urgency of Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration.\n\n\n\nMajorana 1\nMicrosoft’s Majorana 1 does not use superconducting qubits. “It pursues a fundamentally different path to building qubits with topological qubits,” explains Krauthammer, “aiming for a more stable and fault-tolerant system by using exotic quantum states called Majorana zero modes. This was only theorized until Microsoft revealed the Majorana 1.”\n\n\n\nMore stable qubits imply fewer physical qubits per logical qubit will be required. Microsoft claimed that “Today, the company has placed eight topological qubits on a chip designed to scale to one million.” But this scalability is not yet proven in practice.\n\n\n\nScott Best, senior director of silicon security products at Rambus, adds, “The Majorana 1 chip is a notable breakthrough in quantum computing, but only time will tell if they’ve discovered a more feasible path to achieve the highly sought after ‘qubit scalability’.”\n\n\n\nFor more on the Majorana 1 and topological qubits, see What Microsoft’s Majorana 1 Chip Means for Quantum Decryption.\n\n\n\nAmazon’s Ocelot: the cat qubits and boson error protection\nEnter the Ocelot. Architecturally, it is closer to Willow than it is to Majorana 1. “Both Ocelot and Willow rely on superconducting circuits and microwave control to manipulate qubits, and both face the same fundamental issue: superconducting qubits are fast and one of the more widespread architectures – but can be error-prone,” explains Krauthammer. \n\n\n\nBut Ocelot’s qubits come with a twist. Ocelot uses what are known as ‘cat qubits’, so named after Schrodinger’s thought experiment. Cat qubits are significant for bosonic error correction which encodes quantum information within the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of a quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n\n\nThis is further explained by Fernando Brandao and Oskar Painter in an Amazon blog: “One type of bosonic quantum error correction uses cat qubits, named after the dead/alive Schrodinger cat of Erwin Schrodinger’s famous thought experiment. Cat qubits use the quantum superposition of classical-like states of well-defined amplitude and phase to encode a qubit’s worth of information… \n\n\n\n“A major advantage of cat qubits is their inherent protection against bit-flip errors. Increasing the number of photons in the oscillator can make the rate of the bit-flip errors exponentially small. This means that instead of increasing qubit count, we can simply increase the energy of an oscillator, making error correction far more efficient.”\n\n\n\n“Willow has been able to reduce the error rate of both bit-flip and phase-flip errors by improving the way physical qubit measurements are taken,” says Nelson. “Ocelot, on the other hand, has designed its qubits to intrinsically suppress bit-flip errors. Known as ‘cat qubits’, this design has demonstrated up to 90% increase in quantum error correction efficiency.”\n\n\n\nIn this latter sense, Ocelot is closer to Majorana 1 – these chips attempt to reduce errors by qubit design rather than simply correct them.\n\n\n\n“While Willow and Ocelot are refining existing technology, Majorana 1 is still in an earlier experimental stage, needing exotic materials and precise conditions that have yet to be proven scalable,” says Krauthammer. “The question is whether improving superconducting architectures will get us to fault-tolerant quantum computing faster, or if a fundamentally different qubit design is necessary to truly break through… Either way, all these approaches are pushing the field in a truly exciting way, toward the same goal: a practical, scalable quantum computer.”\n\n\n\nManzano adds, “These three chips represent distinct approaches to tackling the challenges of quantum computing. It’s still early days, and the ‘winning’ technology is yet to be determined. However, each advancement pushes the field forward and brings us closer to realizing the transformative potential of quantum computing.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Quantum and the Threat to Encryption\nRelated: QuSecure Banks $28M Series A for Post-Quantum Cryptography Tech\nRelated: PQC Standards Officially Announced by NIST – a History and Explanation\nRelated: Microsoft Adds Support for Post-Quantum Algorithms in SymCrypt Library\n\n“AWS researchers,” claims Amazon, “have, for the first time, combined cat qubit technology and additional quantum error correction components onto a microchip that can be manufactured in a scalable fashion using processes borrowed from the microelectronics industry.”\n\n\n\nBackground to the new quantum chips\nThree new quantum chips from three separate quantum manufacturers in the space of three short months is a dramatic development.

Microsoft claimed that “Today, the company has placed eight topological qubits on a chip designed to scale to one million.” But this scalability is not yet proven in practice.\n\n\n\nScott Best, senior director of silicon security products at Rambus, adds, “The Majorana 1 chip is a notable breakthrough in quantum computing, but only time will tell if they’ve discovered a more feasible path to achieve the highly sought after ‘qubit scalability’.”\n\n\n\nFor more on the Majorana 1 and topological qubits, see What Microsoft’s Majorana 1 Chip Means for Quantum Decryption.\n\n\n\nAmazon’s Ocelot: the cat qubits and boson error protection\nEnter the Ocelot. Architecturally, it is closer to Willow than it is to Majorana 1. “Both Ocelot and Willow rely on superconducting circuits and microwave control to manipulate qubits, and both face the same fundamental issue: superconducting qubits are fast and one of the more widespread architectures – but can be error-prone,” explains Krauthammer. \n\n\n\nBut Ocelot’s qubits come with a twist. Ocelot uses what are known as ‘cat qubits’, so named after Schrodinger’s thought experiment. Cat qubits are significant for bosonic error correction which encodes quantum information within the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of a quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n\n\nThis is further explained by Fernando Brandao and Oskar Painter in an Amazon blog: “One type of bosonic quantum error correction uses cat qubits, named after the dead/alive Schrodinger cat of Erwin Schrodinger’s famous thought experiment. Cat qubits use the quantum superposition of classical-like states of well-defined amplitude and phase to encode a qubit’s worth of information… \n\n\n\n“A major advantage of cat qubits is their inherent protection against bit-flip errors. Increasing the number of photons in the oscillator can make the rate of the bit-flip errors exponentially small. This means that instead of increasing qubit count, we can simply increase the energy of an oscillator, making error correction far more efficient.”\n\n\n\n“Willow has been able to reduce the error rate of both bit-flip and phase-flip errors by improving the way physical qubit measurements are taken,” says Nelson. “Ocelot, on the other hand, has designed its qubits to intrinsically suppress bit-flip errors.

Its existence did not become general knowledge until February 20, when the threat intelligence firm Prodaft posted brief details.\n\n\n\nThe post included a note from ExploitWhispers, written in Russian, suggesting the leak happened because Black Basta had ‘hacked domestic banks’ (that is, Russian banks) and in doing so they had crossed the line. Prodaft also suggested that Black Basta has been largely inactive since the beginning of the year ‘due to internal conflicts’.\n\n\n\nAll of this occurs after the period covered in the 200,000 leaked chats (dating from September 18, 2023, to September 28, 2024). These chat messages are now being analyzed by numerous security vendors and researchers, and reports are beginning to be published. Qualys and VulnCheck, for example, have analyzed the CVEs mentioned within the leak.\n\n\n\nVulnCheck notes that 62 unique CVEs are mentioned in the chats, 53 of which are known to have been exploited although only 44 appear in the CISA KEV catalog. Many of the CVEs were being discussed by Black Basta actors within days of their publication, while three were discussed before their official publication. \n\n\n\n“In addition to using known exploits,” notes VulnCheck, “there is evidence suggesting that Black Basta has the resources to develop new exploits. On several occasions, they also considered purchasing exploits from external groups with hesitancy.”\n\n\n\nQualys uses the chat logs to provide a ‘do now’ list of defensive priorities. It calls Black Basta ‘relentless’, and says the chats reveal “a hit list of weaponized vulnerabilities they exploit against enterprise networks”. The report provides a list of the top 20 CVEs that demand immediate attention, a separate list of the top 10 misconfigurations routinely exploited by Black Basta ransomware, and a full (appendix) list of all 62 CVEs.\n\n\n\nVulnCheck and Qualys unsurprisingly concentrate on the vulnerabilities used or likely to be used by Black Basta and other ransomware gangs. The findings are valuable to cybersecurity defenders seeking a hardening priority list. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThreat intelligence firm Kela and the researcher BushidoToken (known as Will on X) have focused on operational procedures and the dynamics of the group respectively.\n\n\n\nKela focused its analysis on the breach of a Brazilian company in 2023. On October 16, 2023, the chats reveal an RDweb login portal link, with username and password. Cross-referencing these details with its own data lake of infostealing malware logs, Kela deduces that the details came from an infostealer in March 2023, and that the attack started from an infostealer-compromised technical support employee.\n\n\n\nIt “took the actors 2 days to compromise the company, steal the data and deploy ransomware,” notes Kela. By November 7, the attackers were readying the extortion phase – victim details were added to the leak site, possibly initially in hidden mode. On November 10, details were published on the site, with a timer giving 9 days before the full data would be leaked. \n\n\n\nKela suggests that this is typical of a Black Basta attack: initial access via an RD Web (although VPNs to endpoints are also favored), internally harvesting credentials to gain access to and control over critical systems, and data exfiltration and ransomware deployment. Victim profiling is done via Zoominfo to strengthen the actors’ negotiation leverage and help assess the ransom amount to demand.\n\n\n\n“This structured approach, from initial access to data theft and public extortion,” writes Kela, “showcases Black Basta’s strategic use of compromised credentials, internal reconnaissance, and victim profiling to maximize the impact of their ransomware campaigns.”\n\n\n\nThese three analyses seem to depict a well-oiled professional ransomware business, very different from Prodaft’s description of a gang struggling with internal conflicts. BushidoToken’s analysis of the dynamics of the group, as depicted in the personal chats, may provide further insights. He looked closely at the attack on Ascension Health. On May 8, Ascension announced it had instigated ‘downtime procedures’ because of a cybersecurity incident’.\n\n\n\nBy May 9, Black Basta was already discussing how to proceed, although it isn’t always easy to tell whether comments are genuine or sarcastic. Nevertheless, a user named ‘tinker’ wants the role of negotiator. In a longer than usual post he suggests that in order to prevent the attack becoming political (noting that an attack by BlackSuit against Octapharma a week earlier had been labeled “hostile actions by Russia”), and to prevent attracting too much heat against themselves, they should unlock the system free of charge (provide a free decryptor) but then go in hard on ransoming the data. It would seem he was eying a ransom figure somewhere near $100 million.\n\n\n\nHe goes on to explain that he has seen a post on Reddit where a doctor says “I am afraid for my patients and my license. It took me six hours to transfer my patient to palliative care and get a prescription for morphine.” Sentiment within Black Basta seems to change after this. An actor named ‘nn’ asks, “Can I give them the decryption immediately upon request?”\n\n\n\n‘gg’ (generally considered a leader within the group) adds “100% of the FBI and CISA are obliged to get involved, and all this has led to the fact that they will take tough tackle on Black Basta.”\n\n\n\n‘tinker’ comments, “If someone, God forbid, dies… we will rake the problems on our heads – this will be classified as a terrorist attack.” He went on to raise the Colonial Pipeline attack becoming political. He noted that because of the geopolitical situation at the time (9 months before Russia invaded Ukraine) Putin wished to deescalate the pipeline issue. “As a result… the Russian Federation, they went in hard against the ransomvars.”\n\n\n\nHe also added, “I don’t want to go to hell if a child with a heart defect dies.”\n\n\n\nIn the event, Black Basta went further than offering a free decryptor. On May 13, ‘gg’ posted communications with Ascension Health (in reality, probably a Mandiant negotiator), that first provided the decryptor and then demonstrated, with proof, that the stolen data was deleted.\n\n\n\n“From these messages,” writes BushidoToken, “it appears no ransom was paid and Black Basta returned the data and deleted it.”\n\n\n\nBut there is more. “We will not wash off this now and most likely the software will fly to the trash,” says ‘gg’. The researcher interprets this as meaning the group was thinking of ditching the brand of Black Basta and rebranding to another name, adding “The BlackBasta team also mentioned several times during this incident that they were going to have to rebrand because of the attack.”\n\n\n\nThere is an interesting timeline here. Conti disbanded after the Conti leak. Many researchers believe it effectively rebranded as Black Basta. Now we have the Black Basta leak at a time when the group, according to Prodaft, “has been mostly inactive since the start of the year due to internal conflicts.”\n\n\n\nShould we expect to see Black Basta disband and reform under a new name during 2025? That is just idle speculation for now, but an interesting speculation, nonetheless. The one thing we can be sure of is that there will be more analyses of the black Basta leak.\n\n\n\nRelated: Black Basta Ransomware Hit Over 500 Organizations\nRelated: Black Basta Ransomware Group Received Over $100 Million From 90 Victims\nRelated: Black Basta Ransomware Becomes Major Threat in Two Months\nRelated: Healthcare Giant Ascension Hacked, Hospitals Diverting Emergency Service\n\nA 47 Mb JSON file of internal Black Basta chat logs was leaked by an actor named ExploitWhispers on February 11, 2025.

Victim profiling is done via Zoominfo to strengthen the actors’ negotiation leverage and help assess the ransom amount to demand.\n\n\n\n“This structured approach, from initial access to data theft and public extortion,” writes Kela, “showcases Black Basta’s strategic use of compromised credentials, internal reconnaissance, and victim profiling to maximize the impact of their ransomware campaigns.”\n\n\n\nThese three analyses seem to depict a well-oiled professional ransomware business, very different from Prodaft’s description of a gang struggling with internal conflicts. BushidoToken’s analysis of the dynamics of the group, as depicted in the personal chats, may provide further insights. He looked closely at the attack on Ascension Health. On May 8, Ascension announced it had instigated ‘downtime procedures’ because of a cybersecurity incident’.\n\n\n\nBy May 9, Black Basta was already discussing how to proceed, although it isn’t always easy to tell whether comments are genuine or sarcastic. Nevertheless, a user named ‘tinker’ wants the role of negotiator. In a longer than usual post he suggests that in order to prevent the attack becoming political (noting that an attack by BlackSuit against Octapharma a week earlier had been labeled “hostile actions by Russia”), and to prevent attracting too much heat against themselves, they should unlock the system free of charge (provide a free decryptor) but then go in hard on ransoming the data. It would seem he was eying a ransom figure somewhere near $100 million.\n\n\n\nHe goes on to explain that he has seen a post on Reddit where a doctor says “I am afraid for my patients and my license. It took me six hours to transfer my patient to palliative care and get a prescription for morphine.” Sentiment within Black Basta seems to change after this. An actor named ‘nn’ asks, “Can I give them the decryption immediately upon request?”\n\n\n\n‘gg’ (generally considered a leader within the group) adds “100% of the FBI and CISA are obliged to get involved, and all this has led to the fact that they will take tough tackle on Black Basta.”\n\n\n\n‘tinker’ comments, “If someone, God forbid, dies… we will rake the problems on our heads – this will be classified as a terrorist attack.” He went on to raise the Colonial Pipeline attack becoming political. He noted that because of the geopolitical situation at the time (9 months before Russia invaded Ukraine) Putin wished to deescalate the pipeline issue. “As a result… the Russian Federation, they went in hard against the ransomvars.”\n\n\n\nHe also added, “I don’t want to go to hell if a child with a heart defect dies.”\n\n\n\nIn the event, Black Basta went further than offering a free decryptor. On May 13, ‘gg’ posted communications with Ascension Health (in reality, probably a Mandiant negotiator), that first provided the decryptor and then demonstrated, with proof, that the stolen data was deleted.\n\n\n\n“From these messages,” writes BushidoToken, “it appears no ransom was paid and Black Basta returned the data and deleted it.”\n\n\n\nBut there is more. “We will not wash off this now and most likely the software will fly to the trash,” says ‘gg’. The researcher interprets this as meaning the group was thinking of ditching the brand of Black Basta and rebranding to another name, adding “The BlackBasta team also mentioned several times during this incident that they were going to have to rebrand because of the attack.”\n\n\n\nThere is an interesting timeline here. Conti disbanded after the Conti leak. Many researchers believe it effectively rebranded as Black Basta. Now we have the Black Basta leak at a time when the group, according to Prodaft, “has been mostly inactive since the start of the year due to internal conflicts.”\n\n\n\nShould we expect to see Black Basta disband and reform under a new name during 2025? That is just idle speculation for now, but an interesting speculation, nonetheless. The one thing we can be sure of is that there will be more analyses of the black Basta leak.\n\n\n\nRelated: Black Basta Ransomware Hit Over 500 Organizations\nRelated: Black Basta Ransomware Group Received Over $100 Million From 90 Victims\nRelated: Black Basta Ransomware Becomes Major Threat in Two Months\nRelated: Healthcare Giant Ascension Hacked, Hospitals Diverting Emergency Service\n\nAll of this occurs after the period covered in the 200,000 leaked chats (dating from September 18, 2023, to September 28, 2024). These chat messages are now being analyzed by numerous security vendors and researchers, and reports are beginning to be published. Qualys and VulnCheck, for example, have analyzed the CVEs mentioned within the leak.\n\n\n\nVulnCheck notes that 62 unique CVEs are mentioned in the chats, 53 of which are known to have been exploited although only 44 appear in the CISA KEV catalog. Many of the CVEs were being discussed by Black Basta actors within days of their publication, while three were discussed before their official publication. \n\n\n\n“In addition to using known exploits,” notes VulnCheck, “there is evidence suggesting that Black Basta has the resources to develop new exploits. On several occasions, they also considered purchasing exploits from external groups with hesitancy.”\n\n\n\nQualys uses the chat logs to provide a ‘do now’ list of defensive priorities. It calls Black Basta ‘relentless’, and says the chats reveal “a hit list of weaponized vulnerabilities they exploit against enterprise networks”. The report provides a list of the top 20 CVEs that demand immediate attention, a separate list of the top 10 misconfigurations routinely exploited by Black Basta ransomware, and a full (appendix) list of all 62 CVEs.\n\n\n\nVulnCheck and Qualys unsurprisingly concentrate on the vulnerabilities used or likely to be used by Black Basta and other ransomware gangs. The findings are valuable to cybersecurity defenders seeking a hardening priority list. Advertisement.

On October 16, 2023, the chats reveal an RDweb login portal link, with username and password. Cross-referencing these details with its own data lake of infostealing malware logs, Kela deduces that the details came from an infostealer in March 2023, and that the attack started from an infostealer-compromised technical support employee.\n\n\n\nIt “took the actors 2 days to compromise the company, steal the data and deploy ransomware,” notes Kela.

On October 16, 2023, the chats reveal an RDweb login portal link, with username and password. Cross-referencing these details with its own data lake of infostealing malware logs, Kela deduces that the details came from an infostealer in March 2023, and that the attack started from an infostealer-compromised technical support employee.\n\n\n\nIt “took the actors 2 days to compromise the company, steal the data and deploy ransomware,” notes Kela. By November 7, the attackers were readying the extortion phase – victim details were added to the leak site, possibly initially in hidden mode. On November 10, details were published on the site, with a timer giving 9 days before the full data would be leaked. \n\n\n\nKela suggests that this is typical of a Black Basta attack: initial access via an RD Web (although VPNs to endpoints are also favored), internally harvesting credentials to gain access to and control over critical systems, and data exfiltration and ransomware deployment. Victim profiling is done via Zoominfo to strengthen the actors’ negotiation leverage and help assess the ransom amount to demand.\n\n\n\n“This structured approach, from initial access to data theft and public extortion,” writes Kela, “showcases Black Basta’s strategic use of compromised credentials, internal reconnaissance, and victim profiling to maximize the impact of their ransomware campaigns.”\n\n\n\nThese three analyses seem to depict a well-oiled professional ransomware business, very different from Prodaft’s description of a gang struggling with internal conflicts. BushidoToken’s analysis of the dynamics of the group, as depicted in the personal chats, may provide further insights. He looked closely at the attack on Ascension Health. On May 8, Ascension announced it had instigated ‘downtime procedures’ because of a cybersecurity incident’.\n\n\n\nBy May 9, Black Basta was already discussing how to proceed, although it isn’t always easy to tell whether comments are genuine or sarcastic. Nevertheless, a user named ‘tinker’ wants the role of negotiator.
