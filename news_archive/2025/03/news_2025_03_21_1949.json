        "Content": "Threat hunters have uncovered a new threat actor named UAT-5918 that has been attacking critical infrastructure entities in Taiwan since at least 2023.\n\"UAT-5918, a threat actor believed to be motivated by establishing long-term access for information theft, uses a combination of web shells and open-sourced tooling to conduct post-compromise activities to establish persistence in victim environments for information theft and credential harvesting,\" Cisco Talos researchers Jungsoo An, Asheer Malhotra, Brandon White, and Vitor Ventura\nsaid\n.\nBesides critical infrastructure, some of the other targeted verticals include information technology, telecommunications, academia, and healthcare.\nAssessed to be an advanced persistent threat (APT) group looking to establish long-term persistent access in victim environments, UAT-5918 is said to share tactical overlaps with several Chinese hacking crews tracked as\nVolt Typhoon\n,\nFlax Typhoon\n,\nTropic Trooper\n,\nEarth Estries\n, and\nDalbit\n.\nAttack chains orchestrated by the group involve obtaining initial access by exploiting N-day security flaws in unpatched web and application servers exposed to the internet. The foothold is then used to drop several open-source tools to conduct network reconnaissance, system information gathering, and lateral movement.\nUAT-5918's post-exploitation tradecraft involves the use of Fast Reverse Proxy (\nFRP\n) and Neo-reGeorge to set up reverse proxy tunnels for accessing compromised endpoints via attacker controlled remote hosts.\nThe threat actor has also been leveraging tools like Mimikatz, LaZagne, and a browser-based extractor dubbed BrowserDataLite to harvest credentials to further burrow deep into the target environment via RDP, WMIC, or Impact. Also used are Chopper web shell, Crowdoor, and SparrowDoor, the latter two of which have been previously put to use by another threat group called Earth Estries.\nBrowserDataLite, in particular, is designed to pilfer login information, cookies, and browsing history from web browsers. The threat actor also engages in systematic data theft by enumerating local and shared drives to find data of interest.\n\"The activity that we monitored suggests that the post-compromise activity is done manually with the main goal being information theft,\" the researchers said. \"Evidently, it also includes deployment of web shells across any discovered sub-domains and internet-accessible servers to open multiple points of entry to the victim organizations.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The threat actors behind the\nMedusa\nransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation have been observed using a malicious driver dubbed\nABYSSWORKER\nas part of a bring your own vulnerable driver (\nBYOVD\n) attack designed to disable anti-malware tools.\nElastic Security Labs said it observed a Medusa ransomware attack that delivered the encryptor by means of a loader packed using a packer-as-a-service (PaaS) called HeartCrypt.\n\"This loader was deployed alongside a revoked certificate-signed driver from a Chinese vendor we named ABYSSWORKER, which it installs on the victim machine and then uses to target and silence different EDR vendors,\" the company\nsaid\nin a report.\nThe driver in question, \"smuol.sys,\" mimics a legitimate CrowdStrike Falcon driver (\"CSAgent.sys\"). Dozens of ABYSSWORKER artifacts have been detected on the VirusTotal platform dating from August 8, 2024, to February 25, 2025. All the identified samples are signed using likely stolen, revoked certificates from Chinese companies.\nThe fact that the malware is also signed gives it a veneer of trust and allows it to bypass security systems without attracting any attention. It's worth noting that the endpoint detection and response (EDR)-killing driver was\npreviously documented\nby ConnectWise in January 2025 under the name \"nbwdv.sys.\"\nOnce initialized and launched, ABYSSWORKER is designed to add the process ID to a list of global protected processes and listen for incoming device I/O control requests, which are then dispatched to appropriate handlers based on I/O control code.\n\"These handlers cover a wide range of operations, from file manipulation to process and driver termination, providing a comprehensive toolset that can be used to terminate or permanently disable EDR systems,\" Elastic said.\nThe list of some of the I/O control codes is below -\n0x222080 - Enable the driver by sending a password \"7N6bCAoECbItsUR5-h4Rp2nkQxybfKb0F-wgbJGHGh20pWUuN1-ZxfXdiOYps6HTp0X\"\n0x2220c0 - Load necessary kernel APIs\n0x222184 - Copy file\n0x222180 - Delete file\n0x222408 - Kill system threads by module name\n0x222400 - Remove notification callbacks by module name\n0x2220c0 - Load API\n0x222144 - Terminate process by their process ID\n0x222140 - Terminate thread by their thread ID\n0x222084 - Disable malware\n0x222664 - Reboot the machine\nOf particular interest is 0x222400, which can be used to blind security products by searching and removing all registered notification callbacks, an approach also adopted by other EDR-killing tools like\nEDRSandBlast\nand\nRealBlindingEDR\n.\nThe findings follow a report from Venak Security about how threat actors are exploiting a legitimate-but-vulnerable kernel driver associated with Check Point's ZoneAlarm antivirus software as part of a BYOVD attack designed to gain elevated privileges and disable Windows security features like Memory Integrity.\nThe privileged access was then abused by the threat actors to establish a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection to the infected systems, facilitating persistent access. The loophole has since been plugged by Check Point.\n\"As vsdatant.sys operates with high-level kernel privileges, attackers were able to exploit its vulnerabilities, bypassing security protections and antivirus software, and gaining full control of the infected machines,\" the company\nsaid\n.\n\"Once these defenses were bypassed, attackers had full access to the underlying system, the attackers were able to access sensitive information such as user passwords and other stored credentials. This data was then exfiltrated, opening the door for further exploitation.\"\nThe development comes as the\nRansomHub\n(aka Greenbottle and Cyclops) ransomware operation has been attributed to the use of a previously undocumented multi-function backdoor codenamed Betruger by at least one of its affiliates.\nThe implant comes with features typically associated with malware deployed as a precursor to ransomware, such as screenshotting, keylogging, network scanning, privilege escalation, credential dumping, and data exfiltration to a remote server.\n\"The functionality of Betruger indicates that it may have been developed in order to minimize the number of new tools dropped on a targeted network while a ransomware attack is being prepared,\" Broadcom-owned Symantec\nsaid\n, describing it as something of a departure from other custom tools developed by ransomware groups for data exfiltration.\n\"The use of custom malware other than encrypting payloads is relatively unusual in ransomware attacks. Most attackers rely on legitimate tools, living off the land, and publicly available malware such as Mimikatz and Cobalt Strike.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "After conducting over 10,000 automated internal network penetration tests last year,\nvPenTest\nhas uncovered a troubling reality that many businesses still have critical security gaps that attackers can easily exploit.\nOrganizations often assume that firewalls, endpoint protection, and SIEMs are enough to keep them secure. But how effective are these defenses when put to the test? That's where\nvPenTest\n, Vonahi Security's automated network pentesting platform, comes in. Designed to simulate real-world attack scenarios, vPenTest helps organizations find exploitable vulnerabilities before cybercriminals can.\nThese aren't complex, zero-day exploits. They're misconfigurations, weak passwords, and unpatched vulnerabilities that attackers routinely exploit to gain access, move laterally, and escalate privileges within networks. Here's how these risks break down:\n50% stem from misconfigurations\n– Default settings, weak access controls, and overlooked security policies.\n30% are due to missing patches\n– Unpatched systems that leave the door open for known exploits.\n20% involve weak passwords\n– Services running without proper authentication, making it easy for attackers to get in.\nIn this article, we'll cover the\nten most critical internal network security risks\n, breaking down what they are, why they're dangerous, and how to fix them before they turn into real problems. We'll start with the least common and work our way up to the number one issue we've seen across thousands of assessments with\nvPenTest\n. If these weaknesses exist in your environment, attackers will find them—it's just a matter of time.\n10. Password Deficiencies - Redis Service\nCVSS3: 9.9\n% of occurrence: 1.3%\nWhat is it:\nRedis is an in-memory key-value data store commonly used for caching, message brokering, and real-time analytics. By default, Redis does not enforce authentication, allowing clients to connect without credentials.\nSecurity Impact:\nIf an adversary gains access to the Redis service, they may obtain sensitive data stored within the databases hosted on the server and possibly escalate privileges to gain system-level access, depending on the capabilities of the Redis service and the permissions associated with the compromised user account. This could lead to unauthorized data manipulation, data exfiltration, or further exploitation of the system.\nRecommendation:\nIt is imperative to configure the Redis service to require a strong password that meets the organization's password policy. A robust password should encompass the following criteria:\nMinimum of 12 characters\nNot easily guessable, e.g., not found in a dictionary\nCombination of upper-case letters, lower case letters, numerical digits, and/or special characters\nVerifiable against known compromised password databases (e.g.,\nwww.haveibeenpwned.com\n)\nAdditionally, utilizing a password manager can enhance security by generating complex passwords that are difficult to retrieve, even in the event that the password hash is obtained through a breach.\n9. Firebird Servers Accept Default Credentials\nCVSS3: 9.0\n% of occurrence: 1.4%\nWhat is it:\nDefault credentials are often hard-coded usernames and passwords intended for initial setup and should be changed promptly to maintain security. This issue arises when systems are deployed without reconfiguration or when default settings are overlooked during the setup process.\nSecurity Impact:\nThe reliance on default credentials for Firebird servers can lead to unauthorized access, allowing attackers to authenticate and conduct reconnaissance on the affected systems. They could enumerate files or alter system configurations, thereby opening pathways to further exploitation. If the attacker identifies the location of Firebird database files, they may gain the ability to read or modify sensitive database information. Furthermore, certain versions of Firebird can be manipulated to execute system commands, thereby extending an attacker's control over the remote host.\nRecommendation:\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to utilize the GSEC tool to change the default credentials associated with Firebird servers. Additionally, implementing a policy for regular credential audits and ensuring that all default settings are modified before deployment can further enhance security. Continuously monitoring server access logs for unauthorized attempts and enabling alerts for suspicious activities will aid in detecting potential exploitations early.\n8. Microsoft Windows RCE (BlueKeep)\nCVSS3: 9.8\n% of occurrence: 4.4%\nWhat is it:\nBlueKeep is a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), identified as CVE-2019-0708.\nSecurity Impact:\nExploitation of the BlueKeep vulnerability allows an attacker to assume complete control over the affected system(s). This level of access may facilitate further attacks within the organization's infrastructure, including the potential extraction of sensitive data such as passwords and password hashes. Additionally, the attacker could navigate laterally within the network, compromising additional systems and services. The exploit's nature means that no special privileges or authenticated access are required to execute the attack, thus simplifying the process for the attacker and amplifying the potential impact on the organization.\nRecommendation:\nIt is critical to promptly apply all relevant security updates to the affected system(s) to mitigate the BlueKeep vulnerability. Organizations should conduct a thorough review of their patch management processes to identify factors contributing to the absence of timely updates. Given the exploitability of this vulnerability and its ability to severely compromise systems, an immediate response is essential to safeguarding the organization's digital environment.\n7. Microsoft Windows RCE (EternalBlue)\nCVSS3: 9.8\n% of occurrence: 4.5%\nWhat is it:\nEternalBlue is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMBv1) protocol. It allows an attacker to send specially crafted packets to a vulnerable system, enabling unauthorized access and execution of arbitrary code with system-level privileges.\nSecurity Impact:\nExploitation of the EternalBlue vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full administrative access to the affected system(s). This access can facilitate further malicious actions within the organization's network, including the extraction of cleartext passwords and password hashes, as well as lateral movement to other systems. Importantly, this vulnerability does not require the attacker to escalate privileges on the compromised system, meaning they can initiate reconnaissance and further attacks without any additional effort.\nRecommendation:\nTo mitigate the risk associated with the EternalBlue vulnerability, it is imperative to promptly apply the relevant security patches to all affected system(s). Additionally, a thorough review of the organization's patch management program should be conducted to identify any deficiencies that led to the unpatched status of these systems. Given the high risk and prevalence of exploitation of this vulnerability, immediate remediation efforts are crucial.\n6. IPMI Authentication Bypass\nCVSS3: 10.0\n% of occurrence: 15.7%\nWhat is it:\nThe Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a critical hardware solution utilized by network administrators for centralized management of server(s). During the configuration of server(s) equipped with IPMI, certain vulnerabilities may exist that allow attackers to bypass the authentication mechanism remotely. This results in the extraction of password hashes, and in instances where default or weak hashing algorithms are employed, attackers could potentially recover the cleartext passwords.\nSecurity Impact:\nThe ability to extract cleartext passwords presents a significant security risk, as an attacker could leverage this information to gain unauthorized remote access to sensitive services, including Secure Shell (SSH), Telnet, or web-based interfaces. Such unauthorized access could enable configurations manipulation, negatively impacting the availability and integrity of services provided by the compromised server(s).\nRecommendation:\nGiven the absence of a patch for this vulnerability, it is essential to implement one or more of the following mitigation strategies:\nLimit IPMI access strictly to authorized system(s) that require administrative functionalities.\nDisable IPMI service on server(s) that do not need it for business operations.\nChange default administrator password(s) to strong, complex alternatives to enhance security.\nEmploy secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS and SSH, to mitigate the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks that could expose sensitive credentials.\n5. Outdated Microsoft Windows Systems\nCVSS3: 9.8\n% of occurrence: 24.9%\nWhat is it:\nOutdated Microsoft Windows system(s) present significant security risks, as they are no longer receiving critical updates from Microsoft. These system(s) may lack essential security patches addressing known vulnerabilities, effectively rendering them more susceptible to exploitation by attackers. Additionally, the absence of updates can result in compatibility issues with modern security tools and software, further diminishing the system(s)' defenses. Vulnerabilities on outdated systems can often be exploited in attacks, such as malware distribution, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access.\nSecurity Impact:\nIf exploited, an outdated Microsoft Windows system could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the affected system(s), exposing sensitive data and resources. Furthermore, due to the potential similarity in configurations among system(s) within the same network, an attacker may utilize the compromised system(s) as a launching point to move laterally, compromising additional system(s) and increasing the overall footprint of the breach.\nRecommendation:\nIt is strongly recommended to replace outdated versions of Microsoft Windows with current operating system(s) that are still supported by the manufacturer. This should include conducting a thorough inventory of all system(s) to identify and prioritize outdated versions, followed by implementing a phased upgrade strategy. Regularly verify that all system(s) are receiving the latest updates and patches to maintain security integrity.\n4. IPv6 DNS Spoofing\nCVSS3: 10.0\n% of occurrence: 49.9%\nWhat is it:\nThe risk of IPv6 DNS spoofing arises from the possible introduction of a rogue DHCPv6 server within the internal network infrastructure. Due to the preference of Microsoft Windows systems for IPv6 over IPv4, IPv6-capable clients are inclined to obtain their IP address configurations from any available DHCPv6 server.\nSecurity Impact:\nThe deployment of a rogue DHCPv6 server allows an attacker to manipulate DNS requests by redirecting IPv6-enabled clients to utilize the attacker's system as their DNS server. This capability can lead to serious consequences, such as the unauthorized capture of sensitive data, including user credentials. When all DNS queries resolve to the attacker's server, the victim's system may inadvertently communicate with malicious services operating on the attacker's infrastructure, encompassing platforms such as SMB, HTTP, RDP, and MSSQL.\nRecommendation:\nTo mitigate the risks associated with IPv6 DNS spoofing, the following strategies are recommended, with emphasis on aligning each approach with organizational operations and thorough testing prior to implementation:\nManage Rogue DHCP at the Network Layer:\nImplement features such as Rogue DHCP detection, DHCP snooping, and DHCP authentication on network switches and firewalls to control unauthorized DHCP servers and lessen the likelihood of DNS spoofing attacks.\nPrefer IPv4 over IPv6:\nUtilize Group Policy Objects (GPOs) or Group Policy Preferences (GPPs) to deploy registry modifications that configure Windows systems to favor IPv4 over IPv6. It is important to note that this approach will not prevent attacks from affecting non-Windows devices.\nDisable IPv6: While not generally advisable for Microsoft Windows systems, disabling IPv6 may be considered as a last resort precaution, provided thorough testing ensures there are no significant disruptions to business operations.\n3. Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) Spoofing\nCVSS3: 9.8\n% of occurrence: 65.5%\nWhat is it:\nLink-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is a protocol designed for name resolution within internal network environments when traditional Domain Name System (DNS) services are either unavailable or ineffective. LLMNR acts as a fallback mechanism, facilitating the resolution of DNS names through multicast queries. The resolution process unfolds as follows:\nThe system first queries its local host file to find a corresponding IP address for the specified DNS name.\nIf no local entry exists, the system initiates a DNS query directed at its configured DNS server(s) to resolve the name.\nShould the DNS server(s) fail to provide a resolution, the system broadcasts an LLMNR query across the local network, seeking responses from other hosts.\nThis reliance on multicast broadcasts introduces vulnerabilities, as any active system can respond to the queries, potentially misleading the requesting system.\nSecurity Impact:\nThe broadcasting nature of LLMNR queries allows any system on the local network to respond with its own IP address in answer to a resolution request. Malicious actors can exploit this by sending crafted responses containing the attacker's system's address. This capability opens avenues for significant security breaches, particularly if the query is tied to sensitive services such as SMB, MSSQL, or HTTP. Successful redirection can facilitate the capture of sensitive information including plaintext and hashed account credentials. It is pertinent to note that hashed credentials can be subjected to modern brute-force attacks, thereby compromising account security.\nRecommendation:\nTo mitigate the risks associated with LLMNR spoofing, it is critical to disable LLMNR functionality across affected systems. This can be accomplished through the following methods:\nGroup Policy Configuration:\nNavigate to Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Network\\DNS Client and set 'Turn off Multicast Name Resolution' to Enabled. For administering configurations on a Windows Server 2003 domain controller, utilize the Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 7 available at this link.\nRegistry Modification for Windows Vista/7/10 Home Edition:\nAccess the registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\DNSClient and modify the 'EnableMulticast' key to 0 or remove it to disable the feature.\n2. NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) Spoofing\nCVSS3: 9.8\n% of occurrence: 73.3%\nWhat it is:\nThe NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) is a protocol utilized by workstations within an internal network to resolve domain names when a DNS server is unavailable or unresponsive. When a system attempts to resolve a DNS name, it follows these steps:\nThe system first checks its local host file for an entry mapping the DNS name to an IP address.\nIf no local mapping exists, the system sends a DNS query to its configured DNS server(s) in an attempt to retrieve the corresponding IP address.\nIf the DNS server(s) cannot resolve the name, the system broadcasts an NBNS query across the local network, soliciting responses from other systems.\nThis dependency on broadcasts makes the NBNS vulnerable to spoofing attacks, wherein an attacker can respond with a false IP address.\nSecurity Impact:\nThe broadcasting nature of NBNS queries means that any system on the local network can respond. This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors who may answer these queries with the IP address of the attacker's system, redirecting traffic intended for legitimate services. For instance, services such as SMB, MSSQL, or HTTP could inadvertently send sensitive data, including cleartext or hashed account credentials, to the attacker's system. Moreover, modern computational capabilities can facilitate the cracking of hashed credentials, potentially allowing unauthorized access to user accounts.\nRecommendation:\nTo mitigate the risk of NBNS spoofing, it is advisable to disable the NetBIOS service across all hosts within the internal network. This can be accomplished through a variety of methods including configuration of DHCP options, adjustments to network adapter settings, or modifications to the system registry. Implementing these changes will significantly reduce the potential attack surface associated with NBNS.\n1. Multicast DNS (mDNS) Spoofing\nCVSS3: 9.8\n% of occurrence: 78.2%\nWhat it is:\nMulticast DNS (mDNS) serves as a name resolution protocol for local networks, facilitating the resolution of domain names when a dedicated DNS server is unavailable. The resolution process occurs in stages:\nThe system first consults its local host file for any appropriate DNS name/IP address mappings.\nIn the absence of a configured DNS server, the system resorts to mDNS, broadcasting an IP multicast query requesting identification from the host corresponding to the DNS name. This protocol behavior exposes a potential vulnerability that malicious actors can exploit, enabling them to impersonate legitimate systems by responding to these queries.\nSecurity Impact:\nmDNS queries, which are transmitted across the local subnet, can be answered by any device capable of receiving them. This vulnerability allows an attacker to respond with their system's IP address, potentially misleading the querying system. Such exploitation may lead to interception of sensitive information, including unencrypted and hashed credentials, depending on the specific service the victim is trying to access (e.g., SMB, MSSQL, HTTP). It should be noted that hashed credentials can often be compromised within a relatively short timeframe using contemporary computing resources and brute-force attack methodologies.\nRecommendation:\nTo mitigate the risk of mDNS spoofing, the primary recommendation is to completely disable mDNS if it is not in use. On Windows systems, this can often be done by implementing the 'Disable Multicast Name Resolution' group policy. As many applications have the potential to reintroduce mDNS functionality, an alternative strategy is to block UDP port 5353 via the Windows firewall. For non-Windows systems, disabling services such as Apple Bonjour or avahi-daemon can provide similar protection.\nIt is important to note that disabling mDNS may disrupt functionalities such as screen casting and certain conference room technologies. Should complete disabling not be feasible, consider isolating affected systems within a controlled network segment and mandating the use of strong, complex passwords for any accounts that access these systems.\nWhat Pentesting Reveals About Security Gaps\nAfter analyzing tens of thousands of network assessments, one thing is clear—many security gaps aren't the result of advanced hacking techniques but simple, avoidable mistakes. Weak passwords, forgotten misconfigurations, and unpatched systems create easy opportunities for attackers. These aren't once-in-a-lifetime vulnerabilities. They're recurring problems that show up in networks of all sizes, year after year.\nPentesting is like stress-testing your security before a real attacker does. It reveals how someone could break in, move around, and escalate privileges using the same tactics real-world attackers rely on. Time and again, assessments prove that even companies with strong defenses often have hidden weaknesses waiting to be exploited.\nThe problem? Most organizations still rely on annual pentests for compliance, leaving months of blind spots in between. That's where vPenTest from Vonahi Security comes in. It delivers automated, on-demand network pentesting, so instead of waiting for an audit to tell you what went wrong, you can find and fix exploitable vulnerabilities year-round.\nCyber threats aren't slowing down, so security testing shouldn't either. Whether done manually or through automation, regular network pentesting is the key to staying ahead of attackers—not just checking a box for compliance.

        "Content": "Two known threat activity clusters codenamed Head Mare and Twelve have likely joined forces to target Russian entities, new findings from Kaspersky reveal.\n\"Head Mare relied heavily on tools previously associated with Twelve. Additionally, Head Mare attacks utilized command-and-control (C2) servers exclusively linked to Twelve prior to these incidents,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"This suggests potential collaboration and joint campaigns between the two groups.\"\nBoth\nHead Mare\nand\nTwelve\nwere previously documented by Kaspersky in September 2024, with the former leveraging a now-patched vulnerability in WinRAR (CVE-2023-38831) to obtain initial access and deliver malware and in some cases, even deploy ransomware families like LockBit for Windows and Babuk for Linux (ESXi) in exchange for a ransom.\nTwelve, on the other hand, has been observed staging destructive attacks, taking advantage of various publicly available tools to encrypt victims' data and irrevocably destroy their infrastructure with a wiper to prevent recovery efforts.\nKaspersky's latest analysis shows Head Mare's use of two new tools, including CobInt, a backdoor used by\nExCobalt\nand\nCrypt Ghouls\nin attacks aimed at Russian firms in the past, as well as a bespoke implant named PhantomJitter that's installed on servers for remote command execution.\nThe deployment of CobInt has also been observed in attacks mounted by Twelve, with overlaps uncovered between the hacking crew and Crypt Ghouls, indicating some kind of tactical connection between different groups currently targeting Russia.\nOther initial access pathways exploited by Head Mare include the abuse of other known security flaws in Microsoft Exchange Server (e.g., CVE-2021-26855 aka ProxyLogon), as well as via phishing emails bearing rogue attachments and compromising contractors' networks to infiltrate victim infrastructure, a technique known as the\ntrusted relationship attack\n.\n\"The attackers used ProxyLogon to execute a command to download and launch CobInt on the server,\" Kaspersky said, highlighting the use of an updated persistence mechanism that eschews scheduled tasks in favor of creating new privileged local users on a business automation platform server. These accounts are then used to connect to the server via RDP to transfer and execute tools interactively.\nBesides assigning the malicious payloads names that mimic benign operating system files (e.g., calc.exe or winuac.exe), the threat actors have been found to remove traces of their activity by clearing event logs and use proxy and tunneling tools like Gost and Cloudflared to conceal network traffic.\nSome of the other utilities used are\nquser.exe, tasklist.exe, and netstat.exe for system reconnaissance\nfscan and SoftPerfect Network Scanner for local network reconnaissance\nADRecon for gathering information from Active Directory\nMimikatz, secretsdump, and ProcDump for credential harvesting\nRDP for lateral movement\nmRemoteNG, smbexec, wmiexec, PAExec, and PsExec for remote host communication\nRclone for data transfer\nThe attacks culminate with the deployment of LockBit 3.0 and Babuk ransomware on compromised hosts, followed by dropping a note that urges victims to contact them on Telegram for decrypting their files.\n\"Head Mare is actively expanding its set of techniques and tools,\" Kaspersky said. \"In recent attacks, they gained initial access to the target infrastructure by not only using phishing emails with exploits but also by compromising contractors. Head Mare is working with Twelve to launch attacks on state- and privately-controlled companies in Russia.\"\nThe development comes as BI.ZONE\nlinked\nthe North Korea-linked threat actor known as ScarCruft (aka APT37, Reaper, Ricochet Chollima, and Squid Werewolf) to a phishing campaign in December 2024 that delivered a malware loader responsible for deploying an unknown payload from a remote server.\nThe activity, the Russian company said, closely resembles another campaign dubbed\nSHROUDED#SLEEP\nthat Securonix documented in October 2024 as leading to the deployment of a backdoor referred to as VeilShell in intrusions targeting Cambodia and likely other Southeast Asian countries.\nLast month, BI.ZONE also\ndetailed\ncontinued cyber attacks staged by Bloody Wolf to deliver NetSupport RAT as part of a campaign that has compromised more than 400 systems in Kazakhstan and Russia, marking a shift from\nSTRRAT\n.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A new phishing campaign is targeting SEO professionals with malicious Semrush Google Ads that aim to steal their Google account credentials.\nMalwarebytes researcher Jerome Segura and SEO strategist\nElie Berreby\nbelieve that the threat actor is after Google Ads accounts that would enable them to create new malvertising campaigns.\nThis type of “cascading fraud” has been gaining traction recently, as Malwarebytes uncovered in January a similar operation where fake Google Ads hosted on Google Sites\ntargeted Google Ads accounts\n.\n“We believe the criminals behind it likely regrouped and switched to a less direct approach, yet one that might deliver just as much,”\nexplains Malwarebytes\n.\nIn this latest case, the cybercriminals abuse the Semrush brand, a popular software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform used for SEO, online advertising, content marketing, and competitive research.\nMalicious search results\nSource: Malwarebytes\nSemrush is widely used by digital marketers, advertisers, e-commerce businesses, and large enterprises, including 40% of Fortune 500 companies.\nBecause Semrush integrates with Google Analytics and Google Search Console, customers often link valuable Google accounts containing sensitive business data—like revenue metrics, marketing strategies, and customer behavior, all attractive targets for cybercriminals.\nBerreby told BleepingComputer that behind the campaign is a Brazilian threat group who specializes in targeting SaaS platforms and now is employing a particularly crafty technique.\n\"The scammers' ultimate goal are Google accounts. But their second best option are SaaS credentials,\" explained Berreby.\n\"If an enterprise Google account was linked in the past, there's a possibility of exfiltrating sensitive Google data without compromising the Google account itself.\"\nSemrush campaign\nIn the latest campaign, cybercriminals use Google Ads to promote malicious Semrush results when users enter related search terms.\nClicking the ad takes users to a phishing site that looks like Semrush and uses the \"semrush\" domain names but with a different top-level domain than the legitimate company (semrush.com).\nSome malicious domains used in the campaign are “semrush[.]click,” “semrush[.]tech,” auth.seem-rush[.]com,” “semrush-pro[.]co,” and “sem-rushh[.]com.”\nMost of these domains remain online, but not all load the phishing page, suggesting that the threat actor is filtering their targets based on geographical location and other criteria.\nPhishing page\nSource: Malwarebytes\nThe fake login page mimics Semrush’s interface but doesn’t offer the standard sign-in options, forcing visitors to log in via “Log in with Google” only.\nWhen users enter their Google login details, the information is sent directly to the attackers.\nSince many Semrush accounts are integrated with Google Analytics (GA) and Google Search Console (GSC), the threat actors may gain access to sensitive business data without compromising Semrush itself.\nAccessible info post-compromise\nSource: Malwarebytes\nRegarding the persistence of malicious Google Ads and the tech giant's failure to tackle this problem decisively, Berreby explained that it will take big decisions at the higher level to stop this.\n\"I have had multiple chats with Google representatives in the past years about the cybersecurity risks of using Google Ads for malicious purposes,\" Elie Berreby said.\n\"The answer from those well-meaning and hard-working people was always the same: 'I'm just a cog in a huge machine'\n\"The problem is the people we talk with at Google cannot address the underlying issues because they are not decision-makers. They are diligently doing their best at an individual level, but that's not enough, and frankly, that's not acceptable for a giant tech company like Google that uses the most advanced machine learning solutions.\"\nStill, the SEO expert commended Google for responding quickly to their reports and taking down the malicious ads associated with the latest campaign.\nTo avoid getting trapped by Google Ads scams, avoid clicking on promoted/sponsored results, bookmark pages you access frequently to visit them directly, and always double-check that you landed on the official domain before logging in.\nUsing a password manager to fill out login boxes can also help because the data will be typed in on the domains the credentials were saved for.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nFake Homebrew Google ads target Mac users with malware\nWhy it's time for phishing prevention to move beyond email\nFake \"Security Alert\" issues on GitHub use OAuth app to hijack accounts\nCoinbase phishing email tricks users with fake wallet migration\nMalicious Adobe, DocuSign OAuth apps target Microsoft 365 accounts"

The Knox County Sheriff’s office said the arrests are considered the first in the nation for a new type of tap-to-pay fraud.\nResponding to questions about what makes this scheme so remarkable, Knox County said that while it appears the fraudsters are simply buying gift cards, in fact they are using multiple transactions to purchase various gift cards and are plying their scam from state to state.\n“These offenders have been traveling nationwide, using stolen credit card information to purchase gift cards and launder funds,” Knox County Chief Deputy Bernie Lyon wrote. “During Monday’s operation, we recovered gift cards valued at over $23,000, all bought with unsuspecting victims’ information.”\nAsked for specifics about the mobile devices seized from the suspects, Lyon said “tap-to-pay fraud involves a group utilizing Android phones to conduct Apple Pay transactions utilizing stolen or compromised credit/debit card information,” [emphasis added].\nLyon declined to offer additional specifics about the mechanics of the scam, citing an ongoing investigation.\nFord Merrill works in security research at SecAlliance, a CSIS Security Group company. Merrill said there aren’t many valid use cases for Android phones to transmit Apple Pay transactions. That is, he said, unless they are running a custom Android app that KrebsOnSecurity wrote about last month as a part of a deep dive into the sprawling operations of China-based phishing cartels that are breathing new life into the payment card fraud industry (a.k.a. “carding”).\nHow are these China-based phishing groups obtaining stolen payment card data and then loading it onto Google and Apple phones? It all starts with phishing.\nIf you own a mobile phone, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years it has received at least one phishing message that spoofs the U.S. Postal Service to supposedly collect some outstanding delivery fee, or an SMS that pretends to be a local toll road operator warning of a delinquent toll fee.\nThese messages are being sent through sophisticated phishing kits sold by several cybercriminals based in mainland China. And they are not traditional SMS phishing or “smishing” messages, as they bypass the mobile networks entirely. Rather, the missives are sent through the Apple iMessage service and through RCS, the functionally equivalent technology on Google phones.\nPeople who enter their payment card data at one of these sites will be told their financial institution needs to verify the small transaction by sending a one-time passcode to the customer’s mobile device. In reality, that code will be sent by the victim’s financial institution in response to a request by the fraudsters to link the phished card data to a mobile wallet.\nIf the victim then provides that one-time code, the phishers will link the card data to a new mobile wallet from Apple or Google, loading the wallet onto a mobile phone that the scammers control. These phones are then loaded with multiple stolen wallets (often between 5-10 per device) and sold in bulk to scammers on Telegram.\nAn image from the Telegram channel for a popular Chinese smishing kit vendor shows 10 mobile phones for sale, each loaded with 5-7 digital wallets from different financial institutions.\nMerrill found that at least one of the Chinese phishing groups sells an Android app called “Z-NFC” that can relay a valid NFC transaction to anywhere in the world. The user simply waves their phone at a local payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app relays an NFC transaction over the Internet from a phone in China.\n“I would be shocked if this wasn’t the NFC relay app,” Merrill said, concerning the arrested suspects in Tennessee.\nMerrill said the Z-NFC software can work from anywhere in the world, and that one phishing gang offers the software for $500 a month.\n“It can relay both NFC enabled tap-to-pay as well as any digital wallet,” Merrill said. “They even have 24-hour support.”\nOn March 16, the ABC affiliate in Sacramento (ABC10), Calif. aired a segment about two Chinese nationals who were arrested after using an app to run stolen credit cards at a local Target store. The news story quoted investigators saying the men were trying to buy gift cards using a mobile app that cycled through more than 80 stolen payment cards.\nABC10 reported that while most of those transactions were declined, the suspects still made off with $1,400 worth of gift cards. After their arrests, both men reportedly admitted that they were being paid $250 a day to conduct the fraudulent transactions.\nMerrill said it’s not unusual for fraud groups to advertise this kind of work on social media networks, including TikTok.\nA CBS News story on the Sacramento arrests said one of the suspects tried to use 42 separate bank cards, but that 32 were declined. Even so, the man still was reportedly able to spend $855 in the transactions.\nLikewise, the suspect’s alleged accomplice tried 48 transactions on separate cards, finding success 11 times and spending $633, CBS reported.\n“It’s interesting that so many of the cards were declined,” Merrill said. “One reason this might be is that banks are getting better at detecting this type of fraud. The other could be that the cards were already used and so they were already flagged for fraud even before these guys had a chance to use them. So there could be some element of just sending these guys out to stores to see if it works, and if not they’re on their own.”\nMerrill’s investigation into the Telegram sales channels for these China-based phishing gangs shows their phishing sites are actively manned by fraudsters who sit in front of giant racks of Apple and Google phones that are used to send the spam and respond to replies in real time.\nIn other words, the phishing websites are powered by real human operators as long as new messages are being sent. Merrill said the criminals appear to send only a few dozen messages at a time, likely because completing the scam takes manual work by the human operators in China. After all, most one-time codes used for mobile wallet provisioning are generally only good for a few minutes before they expire.\nFor more on how these China-based mobile phishing groups operate, check out How Phished Data Turns Into Apple and Google Wallets.\nThe ashtray says: You’ve been phishing all night.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Friday 21st of March 2025 03:12 PM \r\n         \nProud of Knox County Tennessee Sheriff’s Dept. for uncovering and stopping this fraud and abuse!\nYour email address will not be published.

No information on how passwords can be extracted or decrypted was provided to the LLM.\n\n\n\nAfter establishing clear rules and context in line with the operation’s objectives, the researcher established character motivation in a new LLM session, directed the narrative toward the objective, and, by providing continuous feedback and framing various challenges while maintaining character consistency, convinced the model to build the infostealer.\n\n\n\n“As with any development process, crafting the malware using LLM requires collaboration between humans and machines.

It can also read the output of the commands written in CMD.\n\n\n\nAccording to ESET, however, the analyzed RPipeCommander sample is only the server component, and a second component acting as a client is likely used to send commands from another system on the local network.\n\n\n\n“During 2022, we investigated several compromises where implants such as ShadowPad and SodaMaster, which are commonly employed by China-aligned threat actors, were used.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nIndustry professionals comment on Google acquiring cloud security giant Wiz for $32 billion in cash.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nGoogle this week announced that it’s in the process of acquiring cloud security giant Wiz for $32 billion in cash.\nThe announcement came nearly a year after Wiz walked away from a $23 billion deal with Google after deciding to stick to its original plan and pursue an IPO.\n\n\n\nGoogle says it’s acquiring Wiz in an effort to accelerate cloud security and multicloud use capabilities. \n\n\n\nThe companies said Wiz’s products will continue to be available across all major cloud platforms, but questions have been raised over the exact impact of the deal, and industry professionals have commented on various aspects of what is the biggest-ever cybersecurity acquisition. \n\n\n\nFor additional insights, you can also read Ryan Naraine’s analysis: What’s Behind Google’s $32 Billion Wiz Acquisition?\nAnd the feedback begins…\nMark Kraynak, Co-founder, Partner, Acrew Capital: \n\n\n“At the risk of saying something just brutally obvious, this is a big deal for the cyber security market. In fact it’s the largest deal ever. And comes not that long after the prior largest deal ever (Cisco/Splunk announced a year ago).\n\n\n\nFrom an overall cyber security perspective, it probably signals that what used to be almost unthinkably big mega deals are likely to be the new normal. From an investor standpoint, that’s a good thing, because I believe the IPO market is closed for all but the bravest (most foolhardy?) companies until we see more stability.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, this is going to be a test of the DOJs ongoing antitrust case against Google and the prior administration’s overt hostility to big tech M&A. A lot of software companies, not just cyber security companies, will be watching with great interest.\n\n\n\nMore specifically, it changes the structure of the cloud security market. A formerly independent and relatively dominant player is now a part of one of the big cloud platforms. There’s a lot of speculation as to what that will mean, ranging from Google will continue the path of neutrality to a belief that Wiz’s neutrality is now dead. Only time will tell, but if past patterns repeat, it will be an opportunity for a new neutral player to rise and a lot of the existing Wiz competitors are probably pretty happy about that opportunity.”\n\n\n\nShai Morag, Chief Product Officer, Tenable:\n\n\n“This marks the end of Wiz’s independence and the neutrality its customers have come to expect when using any of the major cloud service provider platforms. When a security vendor is owned by a cloud provider, the lines can quickly become blurred and product decisions can start to favor one platform at the expense of all others. Neutrality becomes nearly impossible and the risk of competitive conflict is off the charts. \n\n\n\nIndependent and cloud-agnostic security providers need only focus on protecting their customers’ cloud and hybrid environments, regardless of what platform or platforms they use. This deal is indeed a fundamental shift in the cloud security marketplace, and Wiz customers should closely monitor any changes it brings.”\n\n\n\nItamar Sher, CEO, Seal Security:\n\n\n“Wiz was the symbol of the #MeanStartup. VCs invest a lot of money upfront to fuel aggressive growth momentum that can disrupt industries with strong incumbents.\n\n\n\nHaving worked with one of the co-founders in the past, I can attest that the hype was justified in their case. Google bought a once-in-a-generation company. Now everyone is watching if they can leverage its potential at Google’s scale like they did with YouTube or if they blunder it.\n\n\n\nI think the key to this acquisition’s success will be Google’s willingness to keep Wiz an independent organization like it did with YouTube. If they can build on Wiz’s product strength in multi-cloud environments without making it GCP-focused, Google can become a dominant player in the cybersecurity industry.”\n\n\n\nParth Shah, Senior Director Product Management, Deepwatch:\n\n\n“Google has been playing catch up on security against AWS and Azure. There’s no way to justify the valuation purely by revenue numbers, it is likely the intangibles and strategies at play. \n\n\n\nGoogle has now spent close to $40B trying to become a security player. This is a serious vertical for them – likely changing the shape of the company forever. Wiz nailed usability and had a maniacal focus on sales – $100M in 18 months, $350M in 2024, and an estimated $700M at acquisition.”\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Gurzeev, CEO, CyCognito:\n\n\n“Google’s bet is on quality here – not just checking a box as some large players do, but investing in a solution trusted and valued by the security community. With recent breaches, SEC pressure, and ongoing trials, risk leaders need solutions that actually work. Big brands delivering empty promises are seen as problematic today, and security executives are more critical than ever. They demand substance, not security theater. That’s why Google’s move makes perfect sense – they’re responding to the market’s demand for tools with proven efficacy rather than just flashy marketing. By acquiring technology that practitioners respect, Google addresses the real concerns of today’s discerning CISOs who prioritize genuine security over compliance checkbox exercises.\n\n\n\nThis acquisition signals cloud growth in its purest form. Companies are going deeper and deeper into the cloud and they’re spread across multiple vendors and dozens of SaaS platforms. Their assets, data, and applications are fragmented across these environments, creating massive security blind spots. The fast rise of AI is also adding extra risk and accelerating threats. Wiz gained traction precisely because it solved this visibility problem across cloud boundaries. Google’s bold move shows they understand that securing these complex environments is essential to customers. They also understand that it’s critical to staying competitive with AWS and Azure, who have both been aggressively expanding their security capabilities through acquisitions and internal development.”\n\n\n\nEric Schwake, Director of Cybersecurity Strategy, Salt Security:\n\n\n“Google’s acquisition of Wiz presents several advantages, particularly an improved security platform for Google Cloud clients, featuring integrated functionalities and ongoing multi-cloud support that may foster innovation. Conversely, drawbacks include diminished competition, concerns regarding vendor lock-in despite Google’s commitments, challenges in integration, the risk of hindering Wiz’s independent innovation, and heightened data privacy issues resulting from increased data consolidation.\n\n\n\nWiz joining Google Cloud marks a significant consolidation in the cybersecurity sector, enhancing Google Cloud’s security services. With Wiz and Mandiant now part of its portfolio, Google strengthens its role as a leading security provider, particularly in cloud security. This development highlights the rising significance of cloud security and the growing need for multi-cloud solutions. For Google Cloud clients, it offers a more powerful and unified security platform, improving their security operations.\n\n\n\nThis acquisition has the potential to accelerate the development of cutting-edge cloud security features by utilizing Google’s AI and infrastructure. A major advantage is Google’s dedication to preserving Wiz’s multi-cloud compatibility, which guarantees flexibility for customers and helps avoid vendor lock-in. However, consolidation may occasionally hinder innovation; yet, Google’s expressed commitment to partner solutions indicates an intention to address this concern. Additionally, this move might result in reduced competition within the cloud security sector.”\n\n\n\nHeath Renfrow, CISO, Co-founder, Fenix24: \n\n\n“Google’s $32 billion acquisition of Wiz is a significant move in the cloud security space, underscoring the growing demand for consolidated security platforms and multicloud protection. This deal reinforces the broader industry trend where hyperscalers are integrating leading security technologies to enhance their native capabilities, much like Microsoft’s approach with its security stack and AWS’s ongoing investments in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nFrom an industry perspective, this acquisition raises important questions: Will Wiz maintain its platform-agnostic approach under Google, or will it become more tightly integrated into Google Cloud’s ecosystem? Additionally, how will this impact organizations that rely on Wiz’s solutions for securing non-Google environments? It’s also worth considering how this affects other cloud security players—especially startups that positioned themselves as alternatives to hyperscaler-native security solutions.\n\n\n\nFor security teams and enterprises, this acquisition further emphasizes the importance of vendor diversification, ensuring that security strategies remain resilient even as market consolidations continue.”\n\n\n\nAriel Litmanovich, CTO, Co-founder, Aryon Security:\n\n\n“This acquisition creates opportunities from all angles. For Google, it strengthens its position as a leading global security player. For customers, many will question whether to continue using Wiz now that it’s part of Google, especially those primarily working with Microsoft and Amazon. This shift could create a significant vacuum in the market, opening up opportunities for acquisitions and growth among other cloud security players. A relevant example is Microsoft Defender for Cloud—a great multi-cloud security product, yet most of its customers are still Microsoft-centric.\n\n\n\nFor cloud providers and other major cloud players, they have two main strategic options: 1) compete directly with Wiz; 2) leverage their strengths and dominate other cloud security areas, positioning themselves as leading platforms. For example, focusing more on prevention of security issues rather than visibility and remediation.”\n\n\n\nShauli Rozen, CEO, Co-founder, ARMO:\n\n\n“The future of cloud security is runtime – to collect runtime data for better and more efficient posture management and real-time threat detection and response. Wiz started to expand into this space (Wiz Defend) but are far from providing a complete solution for runtime. The big question is –  will its acquisition by Google accelerate this process or delay it? Now, there is a big opportunity for smaller runtime security startups to capture in the short run, and we are seeing significant demand from companies looking for cloud runtime security solutions based on technologies like eBPF that can complement their Wiz solution.\n\n\n\nWiz is an amazing company and its rapid rise and astronomical exit shows that cloud security is the hottest market in cybersecurity right now. Yet again, the cyber ecosystem in Israel demonstrates how its innovation is a leading driver for the success of cybersecurity globally.”\n\t\t\t\nThe announcement came nearly a year after Wiz walked away from a $23 billion deal with Google after deciding to stick to its original plan and pursue an IPO.\n\n\n\nGoogle says it’s acquiring Wiz in an effort to accelerate cloud security and multicloud use capabilities. \n\n\n\nThe companies said Wiz’s products will continue to be available across all major cloud platforms, but questions have been raised over the exact impact of the deal, and industry professionals have commented on various aspects of what is the biggest-ever cybersecurity acquisition. \n\n\n\nFor additional insights, you can also read Ryan Naraine’s analysis: What’s Behind Google’s $32 Billion Wiz Acquisition?\nAnd the feedback begins…\nMark Kraynak, Co-founder, Partner, Acrew Capital: \n\n\n“At the risk of saying something just brutally obvious, this is a big deal for the cyber security market.

If they can build on Wiz’s product strength in multi-cloud environments without making it GCP-focused, Google can become a dominant player in the cybersecurity industry.”\n\n\n\nParth Shah, Senior Director Product Management, Deepwatch:\n\n\n“Google has been playing catch up on security against AWS and Azure. There’s no way to justify the valuation purely by revenue numbers, it is likely the intangibles and strategies at play. \n\n\n\nGoogle has now spent close to $40B trying to become a security player. This is a serious vertical for them – likely changing the shape of the company forever. Wiz nailed usability and had a maniacal focus on sales – $100M in 18 months, $350M in 2024, and an estimated $700M at acquisition.”\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Gurzeev, CEO, CyCognito:\n\n\n“Google’s bet is on quality here – not just checking a box as some large players do, but investing in a solution trusted and valued by the security community. With recent breaches, SEC pressure, and ongoing trials, risk leaders need solutions that actually work. Big brands delivering empty promises are seen as problematic today, and security executives are more critical than ever. They demand substance, not security theater. That’s why Google’s move makes perfect sense – they’re responding to the market’s demand for tools with proven efficacy rather than just flashy marketing. By acquiring technology that practitioners respect, Google addresses the real concerns of today’s discerning CISOs who prioritize genuine security over compliance checkbox exercises.\n\n\n\nThis acquisition signals cloud growth in its purest form. Companies are going deeper and deeper into the cloud and they’re spread across multiple vendors and dozens of SaaS platforms. Their assets, data, and applications are fragmented across these environments, creating massive security blind spots. The fast rise of AI is also adding extra risk and accelerating threats. Wiz gained traction precisely because it solved this visibility problem across cloud boundaries. Google’s bold move shows they understand that securing these complex environments is essential to customers. They also understand that it’s critical to staying competitive with AWS and Azure, who have both been aggressively expanding their security capabilities through acquisitions and internal development.”\n\n\n\nEric Schwake, Director of Cybersecurity Strategy, Salt Security:\n\n\n“Google’s acquisition of Wiz presents several advantages, particularly an improved security platform for Google Cloud clients, featuring integrated functionalities and ongoing multi-cloud support that may foster innovation. Conversely, drawbacks include diminished competition, concerns regarding vendor lock-in despite Google’s commitments, challenges in integration, the risk of hindering Wiz’s independent innovation, and heightened data privacy issues resulting from increased data consolidation.\n\n\n\nWiz joining Google Cloud marks a significant consolidation in the cybersecurity sector, enhancing Google Cloud’s security services. With Wiz and Mandiant now part of its portfolio, Google strengthens its role as a leading security provider, particularly in cloud security. This development highlights the rising significance of cloud security and the growing need for multi-cloud solutions. For Google Cloud clients, it offers a more powerful and unified security platform, improving their security operations.\n\n\n\nThis acquisition has the potential to accelerate the development of cutting-edge cloud security features by utilizing Google’s AI and infrastructure. A major advantage is Google’s dedication to preserving Wiz’s multi-cloud compatibility, which guarantees flexibility for customers and helps avoid vendor lock-in. However, consolidation may occasionally hinder innovation; yet, Google’s expressed commitment to partner solutions indicates an intention to address this concern. Additionally, this move might result in reduced competition within the cloud security sector.”\n\n\n\nHeath Renfrow, CISO, Co-founder, Fenix24: \n\n\n“Google’s $32 billion acquisition of Wiz is a significant move in the cloud security space, underscoring the growing demand for consolidated security platforms and multicloud protection. This deal reinforces the broader industry trend where hyperscalers are integrating leading security technologies to enhance their native capabilities, much like Microsoft’s approach with its security stack and AWS’s ongoing investments in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nFrom an industry perspective, this acquisition raises important questions: Will Wiz maintain its platform-agnostic approach under Google, or will it become more tightly integrated into Google Cloud’s ecosystem? Additionally, how will this impact organizations that rely on Wiz’s solutions for securing non-Google environments? It’s also worth considering how this affects other cloud security players—especially startups that positioned themselves as alternatives to hyperscaler-native security solutions.\n\n\n\nFor security teams and enterprises, this acquisition further emphasizes the importance of vendor diversification, ensuring that security strategies remain resilient even as market consolidations continue.”\n\n\n\nAriel Litmanovich, CTO, Co-founder, Aryon Security:\n\n\n“This acquisition creates opportunities from all angles. For Google, it strengthens its position as a leading global security player. For customers, many will question whether to continue using Wiz now that it’s part of Google, especially those primarily working with Microsoft and Amazon. This shift could create a significant vacuum in the market, opening up opportunities for acquisitions and growth among other cloud security players. A relevant example is Microsoft Defender for Cloud—a great multi-cloud security product, yet most of its customers are still Microsoft-centric.\n\n\n\nFor cloud providers and other major cloud players, they have two main strategic options: 1) compete directly with Wiz; 2) leverage their strengths and dominate other cloud security areas, positioning themselves as leading platforms. For example, focusing more on prevention of security issues rather than visibility and remediation.”\n\n\n\nShauli Rozen, CEO, Co-founder, ARMO:\n\n\n“The future of cloud security is runtime – to collect runtime data for better and more efficient posture management and real-time threat detection and response. Wiz started to expand into this space (Wiz Defend) but are far from providing a complete solution for runtime. The big question is –  will its acquisition by Google accelerate this process or delay it? Now, there is a big opportunity for smaller runtime security startups to capture in the short run, and we are seeing significant demand from companies looking for cloud runtime security solutions based on technologies like eBPF that can complement their Wiz solution.\n\n\n\nWiz is an amazing company and its rapid rise and astronomical exit shows that cloud security is the hottest market in cybersecurity right now. Yet again, the cyber ecosystem in Israel demonstrates how its innovation is a leading driver for the success of cybersecurity globally.”\n\t\t\t\nShai Morag, Chief Product Officer, Tenable:\n\n\n“This marks the end of Wiz’s independence and the neutrality its customers have come to expect when using any of the major cloud service provider platforms. When a security vendor is owned by a cloud provider, the lines can quickly become blurred and product decisions can start to favor one platform at the expense of all others. Neutrality becomes nearly impossible and the risk of competitive conflict is off the charts. \n\n\n\nIndependent and cloud-agnostic security providers need only focus on protecting their customers’ cloud and hybrid environments, regardless of what platform or platforms they use. This deal is indeed a fundamental shift in the cloud security marketplace, and Wiz customers should closely monitor any changes it brings.”\n\n\n\nItamar Sher, CEO, Seal Security:\n\n\n“Wiz was the symbol of the #MeanStartup. VCs invest a lot of money upfront to fuel aggressive growth momentum that can disrupt industries with strong incumbents.\n\n\n\nHaving worked with one of the co-founders in the past, I can attest that the hype was justified in their case.

It’s also worth considering how this affects other cloud security players—especially startups that positioned themselves as alternatives to hyperscaler-native security solutions.\n\n\n\nFor security teams and enterprises, this acquisition further emphasizes the importance of vendor diversification, ensuring that security strategies remain resilient even as market consolidations continue.”\n\n\n\nAriel Litmanovich, CTO, Co-founder, Aryon Security:\n\n\n“This acquisition creates opportunities from all angles. For Google, it strengthens its position as a leading global security player. For customers, many will question whether to continue using Wiz now that it’s part of Google, especially those primarily working with Microsoft and Amazon. This shift could create a significant vacuum in the market, opening up opportunities for acquisitions and growth among other cloud security players. A relevant example is Microsoft Defender for Cloud—a great multi-cloud security product, yet most of its customers are still Microsoft-centric.\n\n\n\nFor cloud providers and other major cloud players, they have two main strategic options: 1) compete directly with Wiz; 2) leverage their strengths and dominate other cloud security areas, positioning themselves as leading platforms.

Now, there is a big opportunity for smaller runtime security startups to capture in the short run, and we are seeing significant demand from companies looking for cloud runtime security solutions based on technologies like eBPF that can complement their Wiz solution.\n\n\n\nWiz is an amazing company and its rapid rise and astronomical exit shows that cloud security is the hottest market in cybersecurity right now. Yet again, the cyber ecosystem in Israel demonstrates how its innovation is a leading driver for the success of cybersecurity globally.”\n\t\t\t\nGoogle has now spent close to $40B trying to become a security player. This is a serious vertical for them – likely changing the shape of the company forever. Wiz nailed usability and had a maniacal focus on sales – $100M in 18 months, $350M in 2024, and an estimated $700M at acquisition.”\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Gurzeev, CEO, CyCognito:\n\n\n“Google’s bet is on quality here – not just checking a box as some large players do, but investing in a solution trusted and valued by the security community. With recent breaches, SEC pressure, and ongoing trials, risk leaders need solutions that actually work. Big brands delivering empty promises are seen as problematic today, and security executives are more critical than ever. They demand substance, not security theater. That’s why Google’s move makes perfect sense – they’re responding to the market’s demand for tools with proven efficacy rather than just flashy marketing. By acquiring technology that practitioners respect, Google addresses the real concerns of today’s discerning CISOs who prioritize genuine security over compliance checkbox exercises.\n\n\n\nThis acquisition signals cloud growth in its purest form. Companies are going deeper and deeper into the cloud and they’re spread across multiple vendors and dozens of SaaS platforms. Their assets, data, and applications are fragmented across these environments, creating massive security blind spots. The fast rise of AI is also adding extra risk and accelerating threats. Wiz gained traction precisely because it solved this visibility problem across cloud boundaries. Google’s bold move shows they understand that securing these complex environments is essential to customers. They also understand that it’s critical to staying competitive with AWS and Azure, who have both been aggressively expanding their security capabilities through acquisitions and internal development.”\n\n\n\nEric Schwake, Director of Cybersecurity Strategy, Salt Security:\n\n\n“Google’s acquisition of Wiz presents several advantages, particularly an improved security platform for Google Cloud clients, featuring integrated functionalities and ongoing multi-cloud support that may foster innovation. Conversely, drawbacks include diminished competition, concerns regarding vendor lock-in despite Google’s commitments, challenges in integration, the risk of hindering Wiz’s independent innovation, and heightened data privacy issues resulting from increased data consolidation.\n\n\n\nWiz joining Google Cloud marks a significant consolidation in the cybersecurity sector, enhancing Google Cloud’s security services. With Wiz and Mandiant now part of its portfolio, Google strengthens its role as a leading security provider, particularly in cloud security. This development highlights the rising significance of cloud security and the growing need for multi-cloud solutions. For Google Cloud clients, it offers a more powerful and unified security platform, improving their security operations.\n\n\n\nThis acquisition has the potential to accelerate the development of cutting-edge cloud security features by utilizing Google’s AI and infrastructure. A major advantage is Google’s dedication to preserving Wiz’s multi-cloud compatibility, which guarantees flexibility for customers and helps avoid vendor lock-in. However, consolidation may occasionally hinder innovation; yet, Google’s expressed commitment to partner solutions indicates an intention to address this concern. Additionally, this move might result in reduced competition within the cloud security sector.”\n\n\n\nHeath Renfrow, CISO, Co-founder, Fenix24: \n\n\n“Google’s $32 billion acquisition of Wiz is a significant move in the cloud security space, underscoring the growing demand for consolidated security platforms and multicloud protection. This deal reinforces the broader industry trend where hyperscalers are integrating leading security technologies to enhance their native capabilities, much like Microsoft’s approach with its security stack and AWS’s ongoing investments in cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nFrom an industry perspective, this acquisition raises important questions: Will Wiz maintain its platform-agnostic approach under Google, or will it become more tightly integrated into Google Cloud’s ecosystem? Additionally, how will this impact organizations that rely on Wiz’s solutions for securing non-Google environments? It’s also worth considering how this affects other cloud security players—especially startups that positioned themselves as alternatives to hyperscaler-native security solutions.\n\n\n\nFor security teams and enterprises, this acquisition further emphasizes the importance of vendor diversification, ensuring that security strategies remain resilient even as market consolidations continue.”\n\n\n\nAriel Litmanovich, CTO, Co-founder, Aryon Security:\n\n\n“This acquisition creates opportunities from all angles. For Google, it strengthens its position as a leading global security player. For customers, many will question whether to continue using Wiz now that it’s part of Google, especially those primarily working with Microsoft and Amazon. This shift could create a significant vacuum in the market, opening up opportunities for acquisitions and growth among other cloud security players. A relevant example is Microsoft Defender for Cloud—a great multi-cloud security product, yet most of its customers are still Microsoft-centric.\n\n\n\nFor cloud providers and other major cloud players, they have two main strategic options: 1) compete directly with Wiz; 2) leverage their strengths and dominate other cloud security areas, positioning themselves as leading platforms. For example, focusing more on prevention of security issues rather than visibility and remediation.”\n\n\n\nShauli Rozen, CEO, Co-founder, ARMO:\n\n\n“The future of cloud security is runtime – to collect runtime data for better and more efficient posture management and real-time threat detection and response.

Determining the extent of the attack is part of the ongoing investigation,” the company said.\n\n\n\nAscom said it notified the relevant authorities and underlined that no other IT systems or customer systems were impacted and that its business operations were not affected.\n\n\n\nHellcat claimed to have stolen 44 gigabytes of sensitive data from the company, including contracts, documents, development tools, and source code.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Hellcat claimed the theft of hundreds of gigabytes of data from JLR, a subsidiary of Indian multinational corporation Tata Motors.\n\n\n\nAt least two threat actors affiliated with the group said that stolen credentials for Atlassian Jira were used to access the company’s systems, cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock reports.\n\n\n\nInfostealers were reportedly used to siphon the credentials from LG Electronics employees who had access to JLR’s Jira server, and one of the threat actors said in a forum thread that the exfiltrated credentials dated back to 2021.Advertisement.

Intrusions at Schneider Electric and Telefonica were perpetrated using stolen credentials.\n\n\n\n“What sets the JLR breach apart is the age of the compromised credentials. Hudson Rock, which has tracked infostealer infections since at least 2018, had previously identified the employee’s stolen login details as part of its vast database of exposed credentials. Despite their age, the credentials remained valid and unchanged,” Hudson Rock notes.\n\n\n\nJLR has yet to confirm the cyberattack.

However, to date there does not appear to be any evidence of the collected data actually being exfiltrated. \n\n\n\nSeveral cybersecurity firms have analyzed the incident. One of them is cloud security giant Wiz (recently acquired by Google), which determined based on a lead from researcher Adnan Khan that the root cause of the incident is an action made by Reviewdog, which provides code review tools. \n\n\n\nThe tj-actions/change-files action uses an action called tj-actions/eslint-changed-files, which in turn uses the reviewdog/action-setup action. Tj-actions said its code was modified after the attacker obtained a GitHub personal access token (PAT).\n\n\n\n“We believe that it is likely the compromise of reviewdog/action-setup is the root cause of the compromise of the tj-actions-bot PAT,” Wiz explained.\n\n\n\nReviewdog launched an investigation after being notified by Wiz and determined that several of its actions were impacted. It immediately took steps to address the issue and attempt to prevent future incidents.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nReviewdog said contributors are automatically invited to its GitHub organization and granted write access for maintenance of its actions. The attacker either abused this automatic invitation process or hacked an existing contributor’s account to achieve its goal. \n\n\n\nPalo Alto Networks has also analyzed this GitHub Actions supply chain hack and determined that the attack initially targeted the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.\n\n\n\n“The payload was focused on exploiting the public CI/CD flow of one of [Coinbase’s] open source projects – agentkit, probably with the purpose of leveraging it for further compromises. However, the attacker was not able to use Coinbase secrets or publish packages,” Palo Alto Networks explained.\n\n\n\nThe attacker then moved on to the larger attack that came to light last week. Palo Alto’s analysis also indicates that the reviewdog/action-setup action was the root cause of the incident, and determined that the potential impact is much bigger than initially believed in terms of affected dependencies. \n\n\n\nThe reviewdog/action-setup action is directly used by over 3,000 other actions, which in turn are used by many other projects. According to Palo Alto Networks, the dependency count reaches nearly 160,000 on the third level of the dependency tree.  \n\n\n\n\nHowever, Endor Labs has attempted to analyze the actual damage of the attack, specifically how many repositories actually leaked secrets and whether the exposed information was sensitive. \n\n\n\nThe security firm determined that only 218 of the repositories that depend on the tj-actions/changed-files action actually leaked secrets. Moreover, the majority of those secrets are short-lived tokens that expire when a workflow run is completed.\n\n\n\nThe CVE identifiers CVE-2025-30154 and CVE-2025-30066 have been assigned to the incident, for the Reviewdog and Tj-actions actions, respectively. \n\n\n\nOrganizations concerned about being impacted by such supply chain attacks should review GitHub’s security recommendations for using third-party actions. \n\n\n\nRelated: GitLoker Strikes Again: New “Goissue” Tool Targets GitHub Developers and Corporate Supply Chains\nRelated: GitHub Actions Artifacts Leak Tokens and Expose Cloud Services and Repositories\nRelated: North Korean Fake IT Workers Pose as Blockchain Developers on GitHub\n\nMore details have come to light on the recent supply chain hack targeting GitHub Actions, including the root cause of the incident and its scope.\nThe attack came to light late last week, when it was discovered that the code of a GitHub action named ‘tj-actions/changed-files’, which is actively used by over 23,000 repositories for tracking file and directory changes, had been modified to execute a malicious script designed to dump CI/CD secrets to build logs.\n\n\n\nThreat actors could then obtain the leaked secrets from these logs and leverage them for further attacks.
