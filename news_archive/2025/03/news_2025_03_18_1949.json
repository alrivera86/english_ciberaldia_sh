In other words, the poisoned rules nudge the AI into producing nefarious code.\nThis can be accomplished by using zero-width joiners, bidirectional text markers, and other invisible characters to conceal malicious instructions and exploiting the AI's ability to interpret natural language to generate vulnerable code via semantic patterns that trick the model into overriding ethical and safety constraints.\nFollowing responsible disclosure in late February and March 2024, both Cursor and GiHub have stated that users are responsible for reviewing and accepting suggestions generated by the tools.\n\"'Rules File Backdoor' represents a significant risk by weaponizing the AI itself as an attack vector, effectively turning the developer's most trusted assistant into an unwitting accomplice, potentially affecting millions of end users through compromised software,\" Karliner said.\n\"Once a poisoned rule file is incorporated into a project repository, it affects all future code-generation sessions by team members. Furthermore, the malicious instructions often survive project forking, creating a vector for supply chain attacks that can affect downstream dependencies and end users.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Besides exploiting the flaw at various times, the finding serves as an indication of cross-collaboration among the different threat clusters operating within Pyongyang's cyber apparatus.\nTelemetry data indicates that governments, private entities, financial organizations, think tanks, telecommunication service providers, and military/defense agencies located in the United States, Canada, Russia, South Korea, Vietnam, and Brazil have become the primary targets of attacks exploiting the vulnerability.\nIn the attacks dissected by ZDI, the .LNK files act as a delivery vehicle for known malware families like Lumma Stealer, GuLoader, and Remcos RAT, among others. Notable among these campaigns is the exploitation of ZDI-CAN-25373 by Evil Corp to distribute\nRaspberry Robin\n.\nMicrosoft, for its part, has classified the issue as low severity and does not plan to release a fix.\n\"ZDI-CAN-25373 is an example of (User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information (CWE-451),\" the researchers said. \"This means that the Windows UI failed to present the user with critical information.\"\n\"By exploiting ZDI-CAN-25373, the threat actor can prevent the end user from viewing critical information (commands being executed) related to evaluating the risk level of the file.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "While Okta provides robust native security features, configuration drift, identity sprawl, and misconfigurations can provide opportunities for attackers to find their way in. This article covers four key ways to proactively secure Okta as part of your identity security efforts.\nOkta serves as the cornerstone of identity governance and security for organizations worldwide. However, this prominence has made it a prime target for cybercriminals who seek access to valuable corporate identities, applications, and sensitive data.\nWhile Okta provides robust native security features and recommended best practices, maintaining proper security controls requires constant vigilance. Configuration drift, identity sprawl, and misconfigurations can provide attackers a way into Okta and other apps if left unchecked.\nThis article covers four key ways Nudge Security can help you proactively\nsecure Okta\nas part of your efforts to harden your identity security posture.\n1. Continuous Configuration Monitoring\nEven if you have enabled all of the native security features in Okta and followed their security best practices guidelines, configuration drift can happen over time.\nAs part of its comprehensive\nSaaS security posture management\ncapabilities, Nudge Security continuously monitors your Okta environment and alerts you if you've drifted away from security best practices or if the native security features are not enabled. You'll be alerted to configuration risks like:\nExcessive session lifetime limits\nDisabled threat detection functionality\nMissing behavior detection settings\nDisabled threat insights functionality\n2. Identity Risk Detection\nAs roles and responsibilities change and users join and leave the organization, you can end up with forgotten accounts and users with admin privileges that are no longer appropriate. Nudge Security continuously scans for these risks and notifies you of findings like:\nInactive privileged accounts\nAdmin accounts with weak or missing MFA\nAdmin sprawl\nFormer employees with lingering access\nInactive accounts and those that have never logged in\n3. Ensure Secure Access to Okta\nGiven Okta's important role in securing access to business critical systems, attackers know that if they can gain access to Okta, they can often make their way into other systems with valuable data. Nudge Security helps maintain proper Okta account security by continuously:\nEnsuring MFA is required for enrollment\nEnforcing strong password policies\nDiscovering OAuth grants and API tokens that grant access to Okta\nDetecting logins from multiple Okta users from the same device\n4. Streamlined Remediation\nIt's one thing to get alerted of security gaps, but yet another to ensure they are resolved. And, prioritization is critical to ensure that the most significant risks are mitigated first. When security issues are detected, Nudge Security doesn't just raise alerts - it enables efficient resolution through:\nRisk-based prioritization of findings\nDetailed context and recommended actions for each finding\nAutomated remediation workflows that engage the appropriate stakeholders\nProgress tracking on remediation efforts\nTake the Next Step\nSecuring your Okta environment requires ongoing attention and proactive management. By implementing\nOkta security best practices\n, organizations can better protect their critical identity infrastructure and reduce the risk of security incidents.\nNudge Security provides the continuous monitoring, automated detection, and streamlined remediation capabilities needed to maintain a strong security posture for Okta and your other business critical SaaS apps.\nStart your free 14-day trial\nhere\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

The ad fraud scheme was codenamed Vapor.\nThese apps, which have since been taken down by Google, masqueraded as legitimate apps and collectively amassed more than 56 million downloads between them, generating over 200 million bid requests daily.\n\"Fraudsters behind the Vapor operation have created multiple developer accounts, each hosting only a handful of apps to distribute their operation and evade detection,\" the IAS Threat Lab said. \"This distributed setup ensures that the takedown of any single account would have minimal impact on the overall operation.\"\nBy mimicking seemingly harmless utility, fitness, and lifestyle applications, the operation has been able to successfully dupe unwitting users into installing them.\nAnother important aspect is that the threat actors have been found employing a sneaky technique called\nversioning\n, which involves publishing to the Play Store a functional app sans any malicious functionality such that it passes Google's vetting process. The features are removed in subsequent app updates to show intrusive ads.\nWhat's more, the ads hijack the device's entire screen and prevent the victim from using the device, rendering it largely inoperable. It's assessed that the campaign began sometime around April 2024, before expanding at the start of this year. More than 140 bogus apps were uploaded to the Play Store in October and November alone.\nThe latest findings from the Romanian cybersecurity company show that the campaign is bigger than previously thought, featuring as many as\n331 apps\nthat racked up more than 60 million downloads in total.\nBesides hiding the app's icon from the launcher, some of the identified applications have also been observed attempting to collect credit card data and user credentials for online services. The malware is also capable of exfiltrating device information to an attacker-controlled server.\nAnother technique used for detection evasion is the use of\nLeanback Launcher\n, a type of launcher specifically designed for Android-based TV devices, and changing its own name and icon to impersonate Google Voice.\n\"Attackers figured out a way to hide the apps' icons from the launcher, which is restricted on newer Android iterations,\" Bitdefender said. \"The apps can start without user interaction, even though this should not be technically possible in Android 13.\"\nIt's believed that the campaign is the work of either a single threat actor or several cybercriminals who are making use of the same packing tool that's advertised for sale on underground forums.\n\"The investigated applications bypass Android security restrictions to start activities even if they are not running in the foreground and, without required permissions to do so, spam the users with continuous, full-screen ads,\" the company added. \"The same behavior is used to serve UI elements featuring phishing attempts.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Active since at least 2019, MirrorFace is also referred to as Earth Kasha. It's assessed to be a subgroup within the APT10 umbrella.\nWhile known for its exclusive targeting of Japanese entities, the threat actor's attack on a European organization marks a departure from its typical victimology footprint.\nThat's not all. The intrusion is also notable for deploying a heavily customized variant of AsyncRAT and ANEL (aka UPPERCUT), a backdoor previously linked to APT10.\nThe use of ANEL is significant not only because it highlights a shift from\nLODEINFO\nbut also the return of the backdoor after it was discontinued sometime in late 2018 or early 2019.\n\"Unfortunately, we are not aware of any particular reason for MirrorFace to switch from using LODEINFO to ANEL,\" ESET researcher Dominik Breitenbacher told The Hacker News. \"However, we didn't observe LODEINFO being used throughout the whole 2024 and so far, we haven't seen it being used in 2025 as well. Therefore it seems, MirrorFace switched to ANEL and abandoned LODEINFO for now.\"\nThe Slovakian cybersecurity company also noted that Operation AkaiRyū overlaps with\nCampaign C\nwhich was documented by Japan's National Police Agency (NPA) and National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NCSC) earlier this January.\nOther major changes include the use of a modified version of AsyncRAT and Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels to establish stealthy access to the compromised machines, the latter of which has become a tactic\nincreasingly\nfavored\nby multiple Chinese hacking groups.\nThe attack chains involve using spear-phishing lures to persuade recipients into opening booby-trapped documents or links that launch a loader component named\nANELLDR\nvia DLL side-loading that then decrypts and loads ANEL. Also dropped is a modular backdoor named\nHiddenFace\n(aka NOOPDOOR) that's only used by MirrorFace.\n\"However, there are still a lot of missing pieces of the puzzle to draw a complete picture of the activities,\" ESET said. \"One of the reasons is MirrorFace's improved operational security, which has become more thorough and hinders incident investigations by deleting the delivered tools and files, clearing Windows event logs, and running malware in Windows Sandbox.\"\nFound this article interesting?

It has been described as the largest botnet of infected connected TV (CTV) devices ever uncovered.\n\"BADBOX 2.0, like its predecessor, begins with backdoors on low-cost consumer devices that enable threat actors to load fraud modules remotely,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"These devices communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers owned and operated by a series of distinct but cooperative threat actors.\"\nThe threat actors are known to exploit several methods, ranging from hardware supply chain compromises to third-party marketplaces, to distribute what ostensibly appear to be benign applications that contain surreptitious \"loader\" functionality to infect these devices and applications with the backdoor.\nThe backdoor subsequently causes the infected devices to become part of a larger botnet that's abused for programmatic ad fraud, click fraud, and offers illicit residential proxy services -\nHidden ads and launching hidden WebViews to generate fake ad revenue\nNavigation to low-quality domains and clicking on ads for financial gain\nRouting traffic through compromised devices\nUsing the network for account takeover (ATO), fake account creation, malware distribution, and DDoS attacks\nAs many as one million devices, mainly comprising inexpensive Android tablets, connected TV (CTV) boxes, digital projectors, and car infotainment systems, are estimated to have fallen prey to the BADBOX 2.0 scheme. All the affected devices are manufactured in mainland China and shipped globally. A majority of the infections have been reported in Brazil (37.6%), the United States (18.2%), Mexico (6.3%), and Argentina (5.3%).\nThe operation has since been partially disrupted a second time in three months after an undisclosed number of BADBOX 2.0 domains have been sinkhole in an attempt to cut off communications with the infected devices. Google, for its part, removed a set of 24 apps from the Play Store that distributed the malware. A portion of its infrastructure was\npreviously taken down\nby the German government in December 2024.\n\"The infected devices are Android Open Source Project devices, not Android TV OS devices or Play Protect certified Android devices,\" Google said. \"If a device isn't Play Protect certified, Google doesn't have a record of security and compatibility test results. Play Protect certified Android devices undergo extensive testing to ensure quality and user safety.\"\nThe backdoor that forms the core of the operation is based on an Android malware known as Triada. Codenamed BB2DOOR, it is propagated in three different ways: A pre-installed component on the device, fetched from a remote server when booted for the first time, and downloaded via more than 200 trojanized versions of popular apps from third-party stores.\nIt's said to be the handiwork of a threat cluster named MoYu Group, which advertises residential proxy services built upon BADBOX 2.0-infected devices. Three other threat groups are responsible for overseeing other aspects of the scheme -\nSalesTracker Group, which is connected to the original BADBOX operation as well as a module that monitors infected devices\nLemon Group\n, which is connected to residential proxy services based on BADBOX and an ad fraud campaign across a network of HTML5 (H5) game websites using BADBOX 2.0\nLongTV, a Malaysian internet and media company whose two dozen apps are behind an ad fraud campaign based on an approach known as \"\nevil twin\n\"\n\"These groups were connected to one another through shared infrastructure (common C2 servers) and historical and current business ties,\" HUMAN said.\nThe latest iteration represents a significant evolution and adaptation, with the attacks also relying on infected apps from third-party app stores and a more sophisticated version of the malware that entails modifying legitimate Android libraries to set up persistence.\nInterestingly, there is some evidence to suggest overlaps between BB2DOOR and\nVo1d\n, another malware that's known to specifically target off-brand Android-based TV boxes.\n\"The BADBOX 2.0 threat in particular is compelling in no small part because of the open-season nature of the operation,\" the company added. \"With the backdoor in place, infected devices could be instructed to carry out any cyber attack a threat actor developed.\"\nThe development comes as Google\nremoved\nover 180 Android apps spanning 56 million downloads for their involvement in a sophisticated ad fraud scheme dubbed Vapor that leverages fake Android apps to deploy endless, intrusive full-screen interstitial video ads, per the IAS Threat Lab.\nIt also follows the discovery of a\nnew campaign\nthat employs\nDeepSeek-themed decoy sites\nto trick unsuspecting users into downloading an Android banking malware referred to as\nOcto\n.\nFound this article interesting?

It's assessed to be a proof-of-concept (PoC) created by unknown parties from the University of Mississippi.\n\"When rebooted, the GRUB 2 bootloader shows an image and periodically plays\nDixie\nthrough the PC speaker. This behavior could indicate that the malware is an offensive prank,\" Unit 42 researcher Dominik Reichel said. \"Notably, patching a system with this customized GRUB 2 bootloader image of the malware only works on certain disk configurations.\"\nFound this article interesting?

If those logs had been public, then the attacker would have been able to steal the secrets.\nThe tj-actions developers cannot pinpoint exactly how the attackers compromised a GitHub personal access token (PAT) used by a bot to perform malicious code changes.\nToday, Wiz researchers think they may have found the answer in the form of cascading supply chain attacks that started with another GitHub action named 'reviewdog/action-setup.'\nThe cybersecurity firm reports that the attackers first compromised the v1 tag for the reviewdog/action-setup GitHub action and injected similar code to dump CI/CD secrets to log files.\nAs tj-actions/eslint-changed-files utilizes the reviewdog/action-setup action, it is believed that the compromised action was used to dump tj-action's personal access token and steal it.\n\"We believe that it is likely the compromise of reviewdog/action-setup is the root cause of the compromise of the tj-actions-bot PAT,\"\nexplains Wiz in the report\n.\n\"tj-actions/eslint-changed-files uses reviewdog/action-setup@v1, and the tj-actions/changed-files repository runs this tj-actions/eslint-changed-files Action with a Personal Access Token.\"\n\"The reviewdog Action was compromised during roughly the same time window as the tj-actions PAT compromise.\"\nThe attackers inserted a base64-encoded payload into install.sh, causing secrets from affected CI workflows to be exposed.\nAs in the case of tj-actions, the exposed secrets would be visible on public repositories as part of the workflow logs.\nSupply chain attack overview\nSource: Wiz\nApart from the reviewdog/action-setup@v1 tag that has been confirmed as breached, the following actions may also be impacted:\nreviewdog/action-shellcheck\nreviewdog/action-composite-template\nreviewdog/action-staticcheck\nreviewdog/action-ast-grep\nreviewdog/action-typos\nWiz explains that the security breach at Reviewdog was remediated incidentally, but they informed the team and GitHub of their findings to prevent reoccurrence.\nThough the exact method of the breach hasn't been determined, Wiz comments that review dog maintains a large contributors base and accepts new members via automated invites, which naturally elevates the risk.\nNotably, if the action remained compromised, a repeat attack on tj-actions/changed-files with a successful outcome would be practically possible, potentially exposing the just rotated CI/CD secrets.\nRecommendations\nWiz suggests that potentially impacted projects run\nthis GitHub query\nto check for references to reviewdog/action-setup@v1 in repositories.\nIf double-encoded base64 payloads are found in workflow logs, this should be taken as a confirmation their secrets were leaked.\nDevelopers should immediately remove all references to affected actions across branches, delete workflow logs, and rotate any potentially exposed secrets.\nTo prevent similar compromises in the future, pin GitHub Actions to commit hashes instead of version tags and use GitHub's allow-listing feature to restrict unauthorized actions.\nThose supply chain attacks and leaked CI/CD secrets are bound to have a lasting effect on impacted projects, so quick action is required to mitigate the risks.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nSupply chain attack on popular GitHub Action exposes CI/CD secrets\nDev corrupts NPM libs 'colors' and 'faker' breaking thousands of apps\nNorth Korean Lazarus hackers infect hundreds via npm packages\nSilk Typhoon hackers now target IT supply chains to breach networks\nDeepSeek AI tools impersonated by infostealer malware on PyPI"

Instead, the malware functionality is downloaded post-installation via updates delivered from a command and control (C2) server.\nMalicious apps on Google Play\nSource: IAS Threat Lab\nSome notable cases highlighted by Bitdefender and IAS are:\nAquaTracker\n– 1 million downloads\nClickSave Downloader\n– 1 million downloads\nScan Hawk\n– 1 million downloads\nWater Time Tracker\n– 1 million downloads\nBe More\n– 1 million downloads\nBeatWatch\n– 500,000 downloads\nTranslateScan\n– 100,000 downloads\nHandset Locator\n– 50,000 downloads.\nThey are uploaded on Google Play from various developer accounts, each pushing only a few to the store, so as not to risk high disruption in case of takedowns.

        "Content": "At least 11 state-backed hacking groups from North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China have been exploiting a new Windows vulnerability in data theft and cyber espionage zero-day attacks since 2017.\nHowever, as security researchers Peter Girnus and Aliakbar Zahravi with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) reported today, Microsoft tagged it as \"not meeting the bar servicing\" in late September and said it wouldn't release security updates to address it.\n\"We discovered nearly a thousand Shell Link (.lnk) samples that exploit ZDI-CAN-25373; however, it is probable that the total number of exploitation attempts are much higher,\"\nthey said\n. \"Subsequently, we submitted a proof-of-concept exploit through Trend ZDI's bug bounty program to Microsoft, who declined to address this vulnerability with a security patch.\"\nA Microsoft spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today.\nWhile Microsoft has yet to assign a CVE-ID to this vulnerability, Trend Micro is tracking it internally as\nZDI-CAN-25373\nand said it enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Windows systems.\nAs the researchers found while investigating in-the-wild ZDI-CAN-25373 exploitation, the security flaw has been exploited in widespread attacks by\nmany state-sponsored threat groups and cybercrime gangs\n, including Evil Corp, APT43 (Kimsuky), Bitter, APT37, Mustang Panda, SideWinder, RedHotel, Konni, and others.\nAlthough the campaigns have targeted victims worldwide, they've been primarily focused on North America, South America, Europe, East Asia, and Australia. Out of all the attacks analyzed, nearly 70% were linked to espionage and information theft, while financial gain was the focus of only 20%.\nMap of countries targeted in ZDI-CAN-25373 attacks (Trend Micro)\n​\"Diverse malware payloads and loaders like Ursnif, Gh0st RAT, and Trickbot have been tracked in these campaigns, with malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platforms complicating the threat landscape,\"\nTrend Micro added\n.\nThe ZDI-CAN-25373 Windows zero-day\nThis newly discovered Windows vulnerability (tracked as ZDI-CAN-25373) is caused by a User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information (\nCWE-451\n) weakness, which allows attackers to exploit how Windows displays shortcut (.lnk) files to evade detection and execute code on vulnerable devices without the user's knowledge.\nThreat actors exploit ZDI-CAN-25373 by hiding malicious command-line arguments within .LNK shortcut files using padded whitespaces added to the COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS structure.\nThe researchers say these whitespaces can be in the form of hex codes for Space (\\x20), Horizontal Tab (\\x09), Linefeed (\\x0A), Vertical Tab (\\x0B), Form Feed (\\x0C), and Carriage Return (\\x0D) that can be used as padding.\nIf a Windows user inspects such a .lnk file, the malicious arguments are not displayed in the Windows user interface because of the added whitespaces. As a result, the command line arguments added by the attackers remain hidden from the user's view.\nMalicious arguments not showing in the Target field (Trend Micro)\n\"User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file,\" a\nTrend Micro advisory\nissued today explains.\n\"Crafted data in an .LNK file can cause hazardous content in the file to be invisible to a user who inspects the file via the Windows-provided user interface. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user.\"\nThis vulnerability is\nsimilar to another flaw\ntracked as CVE-2024-43461 that enabled threat actors to use 26 encoded braille whitespace characters (%E2%A0%80) to camouflage HTA files that can download malicious payloads as PDFs. CVE-2024-43461 was found by Peter Girnus, a Senior Threat Researcher at Trend Micro's Zero Day​​​, and patched by Microsoft during the\nSeptember 2024 Patch Tuesday\n.\nThe\nVoid Banshee\nAPT hacking group exploited CVE-2024-43461 in zero-day attacks to deploy information-stealing malware in campaigns against organizations across North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia.\nUpdate March 18, 13:46 EDT\n: A Microsoft spokesperson sent the following statement after publishing time, saying the company is considering to address the flaw in the future:\nWe appreciate the work of ZDI in submitting this report under a coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Microsoft Defender has detections in place to detect and block this threat activity, and the Smart App Control provides an extra layer of protection by blocking malicious files from the Internet. As a security best practice, we encourage customers to exercise caution when downloading files from unknown sources as indicated in security warnings, which have been designed to recognize and warn users about potentially harmful files.

Given the difficulty in guaranteeing that there were no further risks, an immediate disclosure could have caused market panic.\"\nWEMIX is a blockchain-based gaming platform developed by Wemade, a South Korean game company.\nThe WEMIX ecosystem includes its own cryptocurrency, WEMIX token, and integrates blockchain technology into gaming, offering play-to-earn (P2E) models, NFT-based ownership, and decentralized finance (DeFi) features.\nWemade is best known for its hit title, \"The Legend of Mir,\" but since the release of WEMIX, it has focused on blockchain-integrated titles that draw inspiration from the old game.\nThe most successful of those is MIR4, which has over\nfive million downloads\non Google Play alone.\nOther blockchain-based games by Wemade include Night Crows (\n1 million downloads\n), Rise of Stars, Crypto Ball Z, and MIR M (discontinued).\nIn the network for two months\nAccording to yesterday's press conference, hackers infiltrated WEMIX after they stole authentication keys used for monitoring services of the NFT platform 'NILE.'\nAlthough Wemade isn't sure how the attackers acquired the keys, they hypothesized it was by breaching a shared repository where a developer had uploaded them for convenience.\nThe hackers then spent two months planning their attack before they eventually attempted to perform fifteen withdrawals, thirteen of which were successful.\nThe stolen WEMIX tokens were quickly laundered through cryptocurrency exchanges.\nWEMIX is currently offline as all blockchain-related infrastructure is migrated to a new, more secure environment. The firm's goal is to restore the service fully on March 21, 2025.\nIt's also worth noting that the Digital Asset Exchange Alliance (DAXA) designated WEMIX as an \"investment caution\" asset and suspended deposits, a decision WEMIX plans to appeal.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nHackers steal $85 million worth of cryptocurrency from Phemex\nU.S. recovers $31 million stolen in 2021 Uranium Finance hack\nFake CS2 tournament streams used to steal crypto, Steam accounts\nCracked Garry’s Mod, BeamNG.drive games infect gamers with miners\nCanadian charged with stealing $65 million using DeFI crypto exploits"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nPrinters can sit in the corner for ten years or more, while quantum decryption is thought by many to be less than 10 years away.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nAt this year’s HP Amplify printer conference, the firm announced ‘the world’s first business printers to protect against quantum computer attacks’.\nThe printers incorporate the Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) which is a stateful hash-based signature (HBS) scheme. LMS was approved by NIST for post quantum use in 2020 and is described in Special Publication 800-208.\n\n\n\nNIST describes the use case profile as, “The authentication of firmware updates for constrained devices. Some constrained devices that will be deployed in the near future will be in use for decades. These devices will need to have a secure mechanism for receiving firmware updates, and it may not be practical to change the code for verifying signatures on updates once the devices have been deployed.”\n\n\n\nThis could be a description of the modern printer. It explains HP’s motivation for incorporating LMS on two counts: private users and government sales. \n\n\n\nOn the first count, the modern printer is an edge device, quite similar in processing capabilities to a PC. But, as Steve Inch, print security strategist & product management lead at HP, told SecurityWeek, “Printers are traditionally the low man on the totem pole when it comes to priorities for security teams. It’s this box over in the corner. It doesn’t move; it’s just there. It’s not ignored but it’s a low priority for security teams.”\n\n\n\nWhile edge devices generally, and especially printers, may be low priority for defenders, they are high priority for attackers – not least because they are internet-facing with an IP address. There are many ways that attackers can locate exposed printer IPs, and WithSecure research noted in June 2024, “Edge services are often internet accessible, unmonitored, and provide a rapid route to privileged local or network credentials on a server with broad access to the internal network.”\n\n\n\nPrinters don’t have the typical third party defensive apps, such as anti-malware, that can be used to protect them. This throws the security onus on the manufacturer. Inch believes it is incumbent on each manufacturer to counter the inherent insecurity of printers by building strong security into the hardware itself with layers of protection starting at the kernel level.\n\n\n\n“Starting with the chipset and the ASIC we have incorporated a foundation for quantum resistance around the cryptography related to digital signatures. So, our devices have the BIOS boot-up, and when that BIOS is engaged, we can be confident in knowing that the device cannot be cracked.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nRemember that printers can sit in the corner for ten years or more, while quantum decryption is thought by many to be less than 10 years away.\n\n\n\nIn this sense, HP is giving its users a helping hand in the wholesale migration to quantum resistant encryption by providing it on a plate (or in the ASIC). That’s no small matter. “I don’t think there is a human being on the planet that could unequivocally give you a demonstration of complete visibility into their encryption and the touch points in their infrastructure,” says Inch. Finding all those touchpoints and migrating the relevant algorithms to PQC is going to be a lengthy process\n\n\n\n“The printers’ new ASIC chips are designed with quantum-resistant cryptography and enable the use of digital signature verification to protect firmware integrity against quantum attacks,” says HP.\n\n\n\nThe second reason for incorporating quantum resistant cryptography now is to protect its own commercial sales into government. NIST has long required that federal government agencies should complete the migration to quantum-resistant cryptography by 2035. Again, we have those 10 years. But in December 2024, the NSA threw a spanner in the works by declaring that all new acquisitions for national security systems must be CNSA 2.0 compliant from January 1, 2027. CNSA 2.0 provides the list of cryptographic algorithms that are considered-quantum-resilient – that is, those so defined by NIST.\n\n\n\nThat gives appliance manufacturers, such as HP, less than two years to ensure their devices are quantum resistant if they wish to sell into the national security systems market.\n\n\n\nThe dual purpose of launching these quantum resistant printers now at this year’s HP Amplify is to provide security for edge devices and ready-made quantum migration for commercial users: and to maintain HP’s access to the national security systems market.\n\n\n\nThe new printers also offer seamless integration with customers’ zero trust implementations. The printers incorporate HP’s Zero Trust Architecture, which, says Inch, “is almost plug and play with whatever flavor of zero trust is being used by the customer.” This is in furtherance of his principle that it is the printer manufacturer’s responsibility to embed security into the device rather than wait for the user to do something.\n\n\n\nRelated: Xerox Versalink Printer Vulnerabilities Enable Lateral Movement\nRelated: 200 Canon Printer Models May Expose Wi-Fi Connection Data\nRelated: NIST Announces HQC as Fifth Standardized Post Quantum Algorithm\nRelated: Quantum Wars: Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s Competing Paths to Fault-Tolerant Qubits\n\nThe printers incorporate the Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) which is a stateful hash-based signature (HBS) scheme.

AI-driven attacks are becoming more precise and devastating,” said Europol’s Executive Director Catherine De Bolle.\n\n\n\n“Some attacks show a combination of motives of profit and destabilization, as they are increasingly state-aligned and ideologically motivated,” she added.\n\n\n\nThe report, the EU Serious and Organized Crime Threat Assessment 2025, said offenses ranging from drug trafficking to people smuggling, money laundering, cyberattacks and online scams undermine society and the rule of law “by generating illicit proceeds, spreading violence, and normalizing corruption.”\n\n\n\nThe volume of child sexual abuse material available online has increased significantly because of AI, which makes it more difficult to analyze imagery and identify offenders, the report said.\n\n\n\n“By creating highly realistic synthetic media, criminals are able to deceive victims, impersonate individuals and discredit or blackmail targets. The addition of AI-powered voice cloning and live video deepfakes amplifies the threat, enabling new forms of fraud, extortion, and identity theft,” it said.\n\n\n\nStates seeking geopolitical advantage are also using criminals as contractors, the report said, citing cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure and public institutions “originating from Russia and countries in its sphere of influence.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“Hybrid and traditional cybercrime actors will increasingly be intertwined, with state-sponsored actors masking themselves as cybercriminals to conceal their origin and real disruption motives,” it said.\n\n\n\nPolish Interior Ministry Undersecretary of State Maciej Duszczyk cited a recent cyberattack on a hospital as the latest example in his country.\n\n\n\n“Unfortunately this hospital has to stop its activity for the hours because it was lost to a serious cyber-attack,” boosted by AI, he said.\n\n\n\nAI and other technologies “are a catalyst for crime, and drive criminal operations’ efficiency by amplifying their speed, reach, and sophistication,” the report said.\n\n\n\nAs the European Commission prepares to launch a new internal security policy, De Bolle said that nations in Europe need to tackle the threats urgently.\n\n\n\n“We must embed security into everything we do,” said European Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration Magnus Brunner.

In the summer of 2023, the company disclosed two serious flaws, warning that they could expose millions of devices that use AMI’s MegaRAC BMC to takeover and physical damage. \n\n\n\nThe company’s researchers on Tuesday reported discovering a new flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-54085. The new vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023-34329, one of the 2023 vulnerabilities, which allows authentication bypass, but it’s unclear if CVE-2024-54085 is the result of an incomplete patch or an entirely new security hole — that is still being investigated.\n\n\n\nThe BMC enables administrators to remotely monitor and control devices, including to update firmware and install operating systems. BMC made by AMI is present in millions of devices worldwide, including ones made by Asrock, Asus, Arm, Dell, Gigabyte, HPE, Huawei, Inspur, Lenovo, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. \n\n\n\nAccording to Eclypsium, CVE-2024-54085 has been confirmed to impact servers made by HPE, Asus, Asrock and Lenovo. AMI, Lenovo and HPE appear to have published advisories to date to inform customers about patches and mitigations.\n\n\n\nWhile AMI has made available patches, it’s now up to OEMs to push them out to their customers through updates. \n\n\n\nThe vulnerability impacts the Redfish management interface and its exploitation can lead to authentication bypass. It can be remotely exploited to control the targeted machine, deploy malware, tamper with the firmware, and even brick motherboard components, or cause physical damage by changing voltage settings. \n\n\n\n“In disruptive or destructive attacks, attackers can leverage the often heterogeneous environments in data centers to potentially send malicious commands to every other BMC on the same management segment, forcing all devices to continually reboot in a way that victim operators cannot stop,” Eclypsium explained. “In extreme scenarios, the net impact could be indefinite, unrecoverable downtime until and unless devices are re-provisioned.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nA Shodan search conducted by the security firm revealed more than 1,000 internet-exposed MegaRAC instances that could be vulnerable to such attacks. However, a significantly higher number could be vulnerable to attacks conducted by local or network attackers.\n\n\n\nRelated: AMD Patches CPU Vulnerability That Could Break Confidential Computing Protections\nRelated: New SLAP and FLOP CPU Attacks Expose Data From Apple Computers, Phones\nRelated: Palo Alto Networks Addresses Impact of BIOS, Bootloader Vulnerabilities on Its Firewalls\n\nEclypsium has been analyzing AMI BMC security for years.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nZDI has uncovered 1,000 malicious .lnk files used by state-sponsored and cybercrime threat actors to execute malicious commands.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nAt least 11 state-sponsored threat groups have been abusing Windows shortcut files for espionage and data theft, according to an analysis by Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).\nShortcut files, also referred to as LNK or .lnk files, use the Shell Link binary file format to store information for accessing other data objects. These LNK files can point to files, folders or applications. \n\n\n\nHowever, for years threat actors have been using specially crafted LNK files that embed command-line arguments for Cmd or PowerShell that are designed to download and execute malware.\n\n\n\nZDI has identified nearly 1,000 malicious LNK files set up by state-sponsored threat groups and profit-driven cybercriminals to run hidden commands when executed. \n\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that victims are required to manually execute the malicious shortcut files to trigger the execution of the attacker’s commands. To achieve this, threat actors typically disguise the file as a harmless document or other type of file. \n\n\n\nZDI’s analysis has revealed that specially crafted LNK files have been used by 11 state-sponsored APT groups from North Korea, Russia, China, and Iran.\n\n\n\nTargets included government, financial, think tank, telecoms, energy, military and defense, and private organizations in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia.\n\n\n\n\nThe hackers used the LNK files to deliver loaders and other types of malware, with the main objective often being cyberespionage or data theft. \n\n\n\nThe attackers rely on padding and large file sizes to prevent the targeted user from being able to easily determine the true intent of a LNK file. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nZDI describes this issue as user interface (UI) misrepresentation of critical information, arguing that the Windows UI fails to present the user with critical information when checking the file’s properties. Third-party tools are, however, capable of allowing a thorough inspection of a LNK file, which would reveal the hidden commands. \n\n\n\nZDI was hoping to get a CVE identifier assigned to this issue, but it has yet to succeed and is currently tracking it as ZDI-CAN-25373. The company informed Microsoft about the risks in hopes that action would be taken, but said the tech giant assigned it a ‘low severity’ rating and indicated that it will not be addressed in the immediate future.  \n\n\n\nSecurityWeek has reached out to Microsoft for comment and will update this article if the company responds. \n\n\n\n“Organizations should immediately scan and ensure security mitigations for ZDI-CAN-25373, maintain vigilance against suspicious .lnk files, and ensure comprehensive endpoint and network protection measures are in place to detect and respond to this threat,” ZDI recommends. \n\n\n\nUPDATE: Microsoft has clarified that LNK files are treated by Windows as a potentially dangerous file type and attempting to open such a file that was downloaded from the internet automatically triggers a security warning. The company noted that users typically do not inspect a file’s properties, but Microsoft Defender is capable of detecting the use of this technique in a LNK file.\n\n\n\n“We appreciate the work of ZDI in submitting this report under a coordinated vulnerability disclosure,” said a Microsoft spokesperson. “Microsoft Defender has detections in place to detect and block this threat activity, and the Smart App Control provides an extra layer of protection by blocking malicious files from the Internet.
