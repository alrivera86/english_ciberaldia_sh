        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have demonstrated a novel technique that allows a malicious web browser extension to impersonate any installed add-on.\n\"The polymorphic extensions create a pixel perfect replica of the target's icon, HTML popup, workflows and even temporarily disables the legitimate extension, making it extremely convincing for victims to believe that they are providing credentials to the real extension,\" SquareX\nsaid\nin a report published last week.\nThe harvested credentials could then be abused by the threat actors to hijack online accounts and gain unauthorized access to sensitive personal and financial information. The attack affects all Chromium-based web browsers, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and others.\nThe approach banks on the fact that users commonly pin extensions to the browser's toolbar. In a hypothetical attack scenario, threat actors could publish a polymorphic extension to the Chrome Web Store (or any extension marketplace) and disguise it as a utility.\nWhile the add-on provides the advertised functionality so as to not arouse any suspicion, it activates the malicious features in the background by actively scanning for the presence of web resources that correlate to specific target extensions using a technique called web resource hitting.\nOnce a suitable target extension is identified, the attack moves to the next stage, causing it to morph into a replica of the legitimate extension. This is accomplished by changing the rogue extension's icon to match that of the target and temporarily disabling the actual add-on via the \"chrome.management\" API, which leads to it being removed from the toolbar.\n\"The polymorphic extension attack is extremely powerful as it exploits the human tendency to rely on visual cues as a confirmation,\" SquareX said. \"In this case, the extension icons on a pinned bar are used to inform users of the tools they are interacting with.\"\nThe findings come a month after the company also\ndisclosed\nanother attack method called Browser Syncjacking that makes it possible to seize control of a victim's device by means of a seemingly innocuous browser extension.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The Middle East and North Africa have become the target of a new campaign that delivers a modified version of a known malware called\nAsyncRAT\nsince September 2024.\n\"The campaign, which leverages social media to distribute malware, is tied to the region's current geopolitical climate,\" Positive Technologies researchers Klimentiy Galkin and Stanislav Pyzhov\nsaid\nin an analysis published last week. \"The attackers host malware in legitimate online file-sharing accounts or Telegram channels set up specially for this purpose.\"\nThe campaign is estimated to have claimed approximately 900 victims since the fall 2024, the Russian cybersecurity company added, indicating its widespread nature. A majority of the victims are located in Libya, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Tunisia.\nThe activity, attributed to a threat actor dubbed\nDesert Dexter\n, was discovered in February 2025. It chiefly involves creating temporary accounts and news channels on Facebook. These accounts are then used to publish advertisements containing links to a file-sharing service or Telegram channel.\nThe links, in turn, redirect users to a version of the\nAsyncRAT\nmalware that has been altered to include an offline keylogger; search for 16 different cryptocurrency wallet extensions and applications; and communicate with a Telegram bot.\nThe kill chain starts with a RAR archive that either includes a batch script or a JavaScript file, which are programmed to run a PowerShell script that's responsible for triggering the second stage of the attack.\nSpecifically, it terminates processes associated with various .NET services that could prevent the malware from starting, deletes files with the extensions BAT, PS1, and VBS from \"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsHost\" and \"C:\\Users\\Public\" folders, and creates a new VBS file in C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsHost, and BAT and PS1 files in C:\\Users\\Public.\nThe script then establishes persistence on the system, gathers and exfiltrates system information to a Telegram bot, takes a screenshot, and ultimately launches the AsyncRAT payload by injecting it into the \"aspnet_compiler.exe\" executable.\nIt's currently not known who is behind the campaign, although Arabic language comments in the JavaScript file allude to their possible origin.\nFurther analysis of the messages sent to the Telegram bot has revealed screenshots of the attacker's own desktop named \"DEXTERMSI,\" featuring the PowerShell script as well as a tool named\nLuminosity Link RAT\n. Also present in the Telegram bot is a link to a Telegram channel named \"\ndexterlyly\n,\" suggesting that the threat actor could be from Libya. The channel was created on October 5, 2024.\n\"The majority of victims are ordinary users, including employees in the following sectors: Oil production, construction, information technology, [and] agriculture,\" the researchers said.\n\"The tools used by Desert Dexter are not particularly sophisticated. However, the combination of Facebook ads with legitimate services and references to the geopolitical situation has led to the infection of numerous devices.\"\nThe development comes as QiAnXin\nrevealed\ndetails of a spear-phishing campaign dubbed Operation Sea Elephant that has been found targeting scientific research institutions in China with the goal of delivering a backdoor capable of harvesting sensitive information related to ocean sciences and technologies.\nThe activity has been attributed to a cluster named UTG-Q-011, which, it said, is a subset within another adversarial collective called CNC group that shares tactical overlaps with\nPatchwork\n, a threat actor\nsuspected\nto be from India.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "The Need For Unified Security\nGoogle Workspace is where teams collaborate, share ideas, and get work done. But while it makes work easier, it also creates new security challenges. Cybercriminals are constantly evolving, finding ways to exploit misconfigurations, steal sensitive data, and hijack user accounts. Many organizations try to secure their environment by piecing together different security tools, hoping that multiple layers of protection will keep them safe.\nBut in reality, this patchwork approach often creates blind spots, making it harder—not easier—to defend against threats. To truly secure Google Workspace, businesses need a unified security strategy that offers complete protection without unnecessary complexity.\nThe problem with most security solutions is that they only solve part of the puzzle. Point solutions, like tools that block malware or phishing attacks, might work well for a specific type of threat but fail to recognize suspicious user behavior, unauthorized data access, or configuration weaknesses. They operate in silos, addressing individual risks without considering the bigger picture. This means attackers can still slip through the cracks, exploiting gaps between different tools that don't communicate with each other.\nSome companies turn to broader security platforms, like Data Protection and SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) solutions, to cover more ground. While these tools provide high-level oversight and governance across multiple SaaS applications, they often lack the deep specialization needed for Google Workspace. Generic security controls can't always catch\nWorkspace-specific threats\n, like insider misuse, improper file-sharing settings, or privilege escalation tactics that take advantage of Google's native features.\nGoogle Workspace does offer built-in security protections, but managing them effectively can be overwhelming. Many of these controls require constant configuration, monitoring, and fine-tuning to work at their best. Without dedicated security experts, organizations may struggle to set them up correctly, leaving potential gaps that cybercriminals can exploit. Simply put, the tools are there—but without the right expertise, they may not be enough.\nThis fragmented security approach creates a perfect storm for attackers, who thrive on blind spots and misconfigurations. That's why organizations need a unified security solution designed specifically for Google Workspace—one that combines deep visibility, proactive threat detection, and seamless management. A truly effective security solution should not only detect and respond to threats in real-time but also provide proactive defense mechanisms to stop attacks before they happen.\nMost importantly, security shouldn't be a burden. A strong, unified security approach should be easy to manage, even for teams without dedicated security resources. By consolidating visibility, threat detection, compliance management, and incident response into a single, integrated solution, organizations can cut through the complexity and focus on what matters—keeping their data, users, and businesses safe.\nCyber threats aren't slowing down, and attackers are becoming more sophisticated every day. A disjointed security strategy is no longer enough. To fully protect Google Workspace, businesses need an intelligent, comprehensive, and easy-to-manage approach—one that keeps them ahead of threats without slowing the business operations down.\nA New Approach to Workspace Security\nSecuring Google Workspace requires a fundamentally different approach than securing traditional SaaS environments. Most security solutions available today focus on isolated threats: we have point solutions for blocking phishing emails, detecting misconfigurations, or monitoring for data leaks. But this piecemeal strategy leaves critical gaps: without context into the broader Workspace operation, point solutions will miss critical details and, as a result, be unable to detect certain threats.\nA unified approach is needed. One that delivers visibility and contextual awareness across the entire platform, deep integration into Workspace itself, and meaningful automation to enable remediation at machine speed. That's the only way to provide security that is comprehensive, scalable, and manageable.\nYears of experience\nsecuring Google Workspace\nhave convinced us that an effective tool needs to be built on four key pillars:\nComprehensive protection across the security lifecycle:\nWe have decades of proof that perimeter security and inbound email security is simply not sufficient. There are too many ways for attackers to get in. Continuous protection across the entire lifecycle is critical: detect threats early, contain active incidents, respond quickly, and secure sensitive content even when credentials are compromised.\nSecurity that respects how people work:\nThe cure can't be more painful than the problem it's solving. To effectively protect Workspace, a solution needs to fit seamlessly into the workflows of both the end users and how they work as well as the security team responsible for protecting the platform.\nAbility to scale without adding headcount:\nBudgets are tight and the cybersecurity talent gap remains. An effective solution provides effective automation that allows security teams to act much larger than they are while providing the capabilities and tools that allow small security teams to mature their operations faster than they'd otherwise be able.\nDedicated Security for Workspace:\nGoogle Workspace isn't just another app: it's critical infrastructure. The Google infrastructure is overall very safe, but operationalizing its capabilities for modern business isn't straightforward–an effective Workspace security needs to simplify and strengthen Workspace's native capabilities without needing dedicated Workspace expertise on staff.\nThe Future of Google Workspace Security\nGoogle Workspace security doesn't have to be a complicated patchwork of tools and manual oversight. The key to effective protection is a unified approach—one that eliminates blind spots, connects security signals across your entire environment, and automates remediation to keep threats at bay without slowing down business operations.\nMaterial Security is built specifically for Google Workspace, providing deep visibility into every layer of your environment—email, file sharing, user behavior, and security configurations—so you can detect and stop threats before they cause damage. By combining automated remediation, contextual threat detection, and seamless integration with Google's native security controls, Material ensures that your Workspace remains secure without adding unnecessary complexity to your security operations.\nCyber threats are evolving, but your security strategy doesn't have to fall behind. See how Material Security can help you take a smarter, more effective approach to protecting Google Workspace.\nLearn more at\nmaterial.security\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Cyber threats today don't just evolve—they mutate rapidly, testing the resilience of everything from global financial systems to critical infrastructure. As cybersecurity confronts new battlegrounds—ranging from nation-state espionage and ransomware to manipulated AI chatbots—the landscape becomes increasingly complex, prompting vital questions: How secure are our cloud environments? Can our IoT devices be weaponized unnoticed? What happens when cybercriminals leverage traditional mail for digital ransom?\nThis week's events reveal a sobering reality: state-sponsored groups are infiltrating IT supply chains, new ransomware connections are emerging, and attackers are creatively targeting industries previously untouched. Moreover, global law enforcement actions highlight both progress and persistent challenges in countering cybercrime networks.\nDive into this edition to understand the deeper context behind these developments and stay informed about threats that continue reshaping the cybersecurity world.\n⚡ Threat of the Week\nU.S. Charges 12 Chinese Nationals for Nation-State Hacking\n— The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)\nannounced\ncharges against 12 Chinese nationals for their alleged participation in a wide-ranging scheme designed to steal data and suppress free speech and dissent across the world. The defendants include two officers of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) Ministry of Public Security (MPS), eight employees of the company i-Soon, and two members of APT27. \"These malicious cyber actors, acting as freelancers or as employees of i-Soon, conducted computer intrusions at the direction of the PRC's MPS and Ministry of State Security (MSS) and on their own initiative,\" the DoJ said. \"The MPS and MSS paid handsomely for stolen data.\"\nHow to Conduct an AI Risk Assessment [Free Guide]\nWith new AI tools like DeepSeek popping up daily, it's critical to take a proactive approach to mitigating AI risks.\nThis guide covers steps to help you:\nDiscover the AI tools in use in your org\nConduct security reviews for AI vendors\nDetermine where AI tools are connected to other apps\nGet the guide ➝\n🔔 Top News\nU.S. Secret Service Dismantles Garantex\n— A coalition of international law enforcement agencies has\nseized\nthe online infrastructure associated with the cryptocurrency exchange Garantex for facilitating money laundering by transnational criminal organizations. The exchange is estimated to have processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions, with crypto transactions worth more than $60 billion processed since it was sanctioned in 2022. In addition, two individuals Aleksej Besciokov and Aleksandr Mira Serda have been charged in connection with operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.\nSilk Typhoon Goes After IT Supply Chains\n— In what appears to be a shift in tactics, Salt Typhoon, the China-linked threat actor behind the zero-day exploitation of security flaws in Microsoft Exchange servers in January 2021, has\nbegun\nto target the information technology (IT) supply chain, specifically remote management tools and cloud applications, as a means to obtain initial access to corporate networks. Upon gaining successful access, the threat actors have been found using stolen keys and credentials to further burrow into the compromised network and exfiltrate data of interest.\nDark Caracal Linked to Use of Poco RAT\n— The threat actor called Dark Caracal has been linked to a phishing campaign that distributed a remote access trojan called\nPoco RAT\nin attacks targeting Spanish-speaking targets in Latin America in 2024. An analysis of Poco RAT artifacts indicates the intrusions are mainly targeting enterprises in Venezuela, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Ecuador.\nLinks Between Black Basta and CACTUS Ransomware Examined\n— Threat actors deploying the Black Basta and CACTUS ransomware families have been\nfound\nto rely on the same BackConnect (BC) module for maintaining persistent control over compromised systems, a sign that affiliates previously associated with Black Basta may have transitioned to CACTUS. The BackConnect module has source code references to QakBot, indicating likely shared authorship. The component is distributed via sophisticated social engineering tactics to trick targets into installing the Quick Assist remote desktop software.\nU.A.E. Entities Targeted by UNK_CraftyCamel\n— A previously undocumented threat activity cluster dubbed\nUNK_CraftyCamel\nhas targeted \"fewer than five\" aviation and satellite communications entities in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) to deliver a previously undocumented Golang backdoor dubbed Sosano. The attacks stand out because they took advantage of a compromised email account belonging to the Indian electronics company INDIC Electronics to send phishing messages. It's suspected that the campaign is the work of an Iranian-aligned hacking group.\nTrending CVEs\nThe software you rely on every day can have hidden risks that hackers actively target. Staying safe means keeping up-to-date with the latest security patches before vulnerabilities become costly breaches.\nHere's this week's critical list of software vulnerabilities you should urgently patch or review to protect your systems —\nCVE-2025-25015\n(Elastic Kibana),\nCVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225, CVE-2025-22226\n(VMware),\nCVE-2024-50302\n(Google Android),\nCVE-2025-0364\n(BigAntSoft BigAnt),\nCVE-2024-48248\n(NAKIVO Backup & Replication),\nCVE-2025-1723\n(Zoho ADSelfService Plus),\nCVE-2025-27423\n(Vim),\nCVE-2025-24494\n(Keysight Ixia Vision),\nCVE-2025-1080\n(LibreOffice),\nCVE-2025-27218\n(Sitecore),\nCVE-2025-20206\n(Cisco Secure Client for Windows),\nCVE-2024-56325\n(Apache Pinot),\nCVE-2025-1316\n(Edimax IC-7100),\nCVE-2025-27622, CVE-2025-27623\n(Jenkins), and\nCVE-2024-41334 through CVE-2024-41340, CVE-2024-51138, CVE-2024-51139\n(Draytek routers).\n📰 Around the Cyber World\nApple Reportedly Pushes Back Against Backdoor Access\n— Apple appears to be pushing back against a secret order issued by the U.K. to give the government access to encrypted iCloud data. According to a\nreport\nfrom the Financial Times, the company has filed an appeal with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, an independent judicial body that examines complaints against the U.K. security services, in hopes of overturning the order. The tribunal is expected to probe whether \"the U.K.'s notice to Apple was lawful and, if not, could order it to be quashed.\" Apple recently\nstopped\noffering Advanced Data Protection in the U.K. in response to the secret order.\nIoT Devices Targeted by New Eleven11bot Botnet\n— A new botnet malware dubbed Eleven11bot is estimated to have infected thousands of IoT devices, primarily security cameras and network video recorders (NVRs), to conduct volumetric DDoS attacks. A majority of the infections are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Canada, and Australia, per The Shadowserver Foundation. Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise said it has observed 1,042 IP addresses tied to the botnet's operation in the past month, most of which are based in Iran. Eleven11bot is assessed to be a variant of the infamous Mirai malware, which had its source code leaked in 2016. That said, there have been conflicting reports on the number of devices comprising Eleven11bot. Nokia\nsaid\nthe botnet is made of roughly 30,000 devices, the Shadowserver Foundation\nsaid\nthe size is well over 86,000. However, GreyNoise\nestimated\nthe true number was likely fewer than 5,000.\nU.S. Treasury Sanctions Iranian National for Running Nemesis Market\n— The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday announced sanctions against an Iranian national named Behrouz Parsarad for running an online darknet marketplace called Nemesis Market that was used for trading drugs and cybercrime services. The online bazaar was\nshut down\nin March 2024 as a result of a law enforcement operation conducted by Germany, the U.S., and Lithuania. \"As the administrator of the Nemesis darknet marketplace, Parsarad sought to build — and continues to try to re-establish — a safe haven to facilitate the production, sale, and shipment of illegal narcotics like fentanyl and other synthetic opioids,\" the Treasury Department\nsaid\n.\nMoonstone Sleet Deploys Qilin Ransomware\n— Microsoft revealed that it observed the North Korean threat actor tracked as\nMoonstone Sleet\ndeploying\nQilin ransomware\nat a limited number of organizations in late February 2025. \"Qilin is a ransomware as a service (RaaS) payload used by multiple threat actors, both state-sponsored and cybercriminal groups,\" it\nsaid\n. \"Moonstone Sleet has previously exclusively deployed their own custom ransomware in their attacks, and this represents the first instance they are deploying ransomware developed by a RaaS operator.\"\nKaspersky Flags Thousands of Malicious Installations of Banking Trojans\n— Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said it prevented a total of 33.3 million attacks involving malware, adware, or unwanted mobile software in 2024. Adware accounted for 35% of total detections, with 1.13 million malicious and potentially unwanted installation packages detected. Nearly 69,000 of those installations were associated with banking trojans. The company said it also discovered threat actors using novel social engineering tactics to distribute the Mamont banking trojan targeting Android devices in Russia. \"The attackers lured users with a variety of discounted products,\" it\nsaid\n. \"The victim had to send a message to place an order. Some time later, the user received a phishing link to download malware disguised as a shipment tracking app.\"\nPrintSteal Campaigns Engages in Large-Scale KYC Document Generation Fraud in India\n— Details have emerged about a large-scale, organized criminal operation that involves the mass production and distribution of fake Indian KYC (Know Your Customer) documents, an activity that has been codenamed PrintSteal by CloudSEK. One such platform, named crrsg.site, is estimated to have fueled the creation of more than 167,391 fake documents since its creation in 2021. There are at least 2,727 registered operators on crrsg.site. \"The infrastructure of this operation includes a centralized web platform, access to illicit APIs that provide data like Aadhaar, PAN, and vehicle information, a streamlined payment system, and encrypted communication channels (such as Telegram),\" CloudSEK researcher Abhishek Mathew\nsaid\n. \"The operation relies heavily on a network of affiliates, primarily local businesses like mobile shops and internet cafes, which serve as points of contact for customers seeking fake documents.\" Further investigation has revealed that an individual named Manish Kumar is a key figure behind crrsg.site. To date, no less than 1,800 domains have been identified as part of this operation, with over 600 domains currently active.\nMalicious Use of Cobalt Strike Down 80% Since 2023\n— In April 2023, Microsoft and Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Health-ISAC) teamed up with Fortra, the company behind Cobalt Strike, to\ncombat the abuse\nof the post-exploitation toolkit by bad actors to facilitate malicious activities. Since then, the number of unauthorized copies of Cobalt Strike observed in the wild has decreased by 80%, Fortra said. The company said it also seized and sinkholed over 200 malicious domains, effectively severing the connections. \"Additionally, the average dwell time — the period between initial detection and takedown — has been reduced to less than one week in the United States and less than two weeks worldwide,\" it\nadded\n. In July 2024, a coordinated law enforcement operation codenamed MORPHEUS\ndismantled 593 servers\nthat were used by cybercriminal groups and were part of an attack infrastructure associated with unlicensed versions of Cobalt Strike.\nCrowdStrike Reports $21 Million Loss from July 2024 Outage\n— Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike\nreported\nanother $21 million in costs related to the\nJuly 19, 2024, outage\nin the fourth quarter, bringing the annual total to $60 million. In a related development, security firm SEC Consult detailed a now-patched vulnerability in CrowdStrike Falcon that allowed attackers to pause the sensor. \"The vulnerability allowed an attacker with 'NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM' permissions to suspend the CS Falcon Sensor processes,\" the Austrian company\nsaid\n. \"A subset of malicious applications that are blocked or deleted when the CS Falcon Sensor processes are active could be executed or retained on the disk after the CS Falcon Sensor processes were suspended. This leads to a partial bypass of the CS Falcon Sensor detection mechanisms.\"\nFBI Warns of Fake Ransomware Notes Sent via Snail Mail\n— The U.S. government is\nwarning\nthat scammers are masquerading as the\nBianLian\n(aka Bitter Scorpius) ransomware and data extortion group to target corporate executives by sending extortion letters that threaten to release sensitive information on the e-crime gang's data leak site unless payment ranging between $250,000 and $500,000 is received within 10 days from receipt of the letter. The letters are believed to be an attempt to scam organizations into paying a ransom. Cybersecurity firm Arctic Wolf\nsaid\nthe letters were being sent to executives primarily within the U.S. healthcare industry, but noted that the physical ransom letters are drastically different in word usage and tone from those of the actual BianLian group.\nGuidePoint Security\nand\nPalo Alto Networks Unit 42\nalso pointed out that the activity is likely the work of an imposter.\nMoscow-Based News Network Poisons AI Chatbot Results\n— A Moscow-based disinformation network named Pravda is\npublishing\nfalse claims and pro-Kremlin propaganda to deliberately distort responses from artificial intelligence (AI) models that rely on up-to-date information. The network, which uses search engine optimization strategies to boost the visibility of its content, is said to have published 3.6 million misleading articles in 2024 alone. \"By flooding search results and web crawlers with pro-Kremlin falsehoods, the network is distorting how large language models process and present news and information,\" NewsGuard said, adding \"the leading AI chatbots repeated false narratives laundered by the Pravda network 33 percent of the time.\"\nDoJ Charges 2 Venezuelans for ATM Jackpotting Scheme\n— The U.S. Justice Department said two Venezuelan nationals David Jose Gomez Cegarra, 24, and Jesus Segundo Hernandez-Gil, 19, were arrested and charged recently over their role in an ATM jackpotting scheme in the U.S. states of New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois in October and November 2024. The charges carry a maximum penalty of ten years in prison. \"ATM Jackpotting involves removing an ATM's cover and infecting the ATMs hard drive with malware or removing the hard drive and replacing it with an infected hard drive, which allows the operator to assume control of the ATM and cause it to dispense currency,\" the agency\nsaid\n.\nResearchers Flag Flaw in China's Great Firewall\n— Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a now-fixed buffer over-read vulnerability dubbed\nWallbleed\nin the DNS injection subsystem of the Great Firewall of China that could result in information disclosure, causing certain nation-wide censorship middleboxes to reveal up to 125 bytes of their memory when censoring a crafted DNS query. It was patched in March 2024. \"Until March 2024, certain DNS injection devices had a parsing bug that would, under certain conditions, cause them to include up to 125 bytes of their own memory in the forged DNS responses they sent,\" a group of academics said. The GFW's DNS injection subsystem\nrelies\non what's called DNS spoofing and tampering to inject fake DNS responses containing random IP addresses when a request matches a banned keyword or a blocked domain.\nNine Threat Groups Active in OT Operations in 2024\n— Industrial cybersecurity company Dragos said nine out of the 23 threat groups it tracks as targeting industrial organizations were active in 2024. Two of them –\nBauxite\n(aka Cyber Av3ngers) and\nGraphite\n(aka APT28) – have been identified as two new threat groups setting their sights on operational technology (OT) networks. \"A striking trend in 2024 was the continued lowering of the barrier to entry for adversaries targeting OT/ICS,\" Dragos\nsaid\n. \"Adversaries that would have once been unaware of or ignored OT/ICS entirely now view it as an effective attack vector to achieve disruption and attention.\" Furthermore, the number of ransomware attacks targeting OT systems increased by 87% in 2024, and the number of groups going after such targets spiked by 60%. The disclosure comes as CrowdStrike\nrevealed\nthat China-nexus activity increased by 150% across all sectors in 2024, with a \"staggering 200-300% surge\" in key targeted industries including financial services, media, manufacturing, and industrials/engineering. The security vendor, which is tracking 257 named adversaries and over 140 emerging activity clusters, said adversaries are increasingly targeting cloud-based SaaS applications for data theft, lateral movement, extortion, and third-party targeting. Some of the new notable clusters include\nEnvoy Panda\n(aka BackdoorDiplomacy),\nLiminal Panda\n,\nLocksmith Panda\n,\nOperator Panda\n(aka Salt Typhoon),\nVanguard Panda\n(aka Volt Typhoon), and\nVault Panda\n(aka Earth Berberoka).\nGoogle Details AMD Zen Vulnerability\n— Google researchers have disclosed the details of a recently patched AMD processor vulnerability dubbed\nEntrySign\n(CVE-2024-56161, CVSS score: 7.2) that could potentially permit an attacker to load a malicious CPU microcode under specific conditions. In a nutshell, the vulnerability enables arbitrary microcode patches to be installed on all Zen 1 through Zen 4 CPUs. \"Luckily, the security impact was limited by the fact that attackers must first obtain host ring 0 access in order to attempt to install a microcode patch and that these patches do not persist through a power cycle,\" Google\nsaid\n. \"Confidential computing using SEV-SNP, DRTM using SKINIT, and supply chain modification are some of the situations where the threat model permits an attacker to subvert microcode patches.\"\n🎥 Expert Webinar\nTraditional AppSec is Broken—Watch This to See How ASPM Can Fix It\nTraditional AppSec tools often struggle with today's complex software environments, creating security blind spots. Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) promises to bridge these gaps by combining code-level insights and runtime context. But is ASPM the future or a passing trend?\nJoin Amir Kaushansky from Palo Alto Networks to quickly grasp ASPM's real-world benefits—such as proactive risk management and reduced patching workloads.

Designed specifically for use with the Orbic RC400L mobile hotspot, Rayhunter helps users detect if their cellular communications are being monitored. While built mainly for research and testing purposes—rather than high-risk situations—the tool offers a user-friendly web interface, allowing easy monitoring, capture of cellular signals, and basic analysis of potential spying attempts. Although Rayhunter might function on similar Qualcomm-based Linux or Android devices, compatibility is currently only confirmed for this specific Orbic model.\nGCPGoat\n: A Damn Vulnerable GCP Infrastructure — GCPGoat is a purposely vulnerable Google Cloud environment designed to help users safely learn cloud security. It mirrors real-world mistakes in cloud setups, covering OWASP's top web app risks and common misconfigurations. Users can practice penetration testing, audit infrastructure code, improve secure coding, and enhance threat detection directly in their own GCP accounts.\n🔒 Tip of the Week\nGet Defense Against Advanced 'Living off the Land' Threats\n— Hackers often misuse built-in tools like PowerShell (Windows) or common Linux utilities to quietly break into systems—this is called a \"Living off the Land\" (LotL) attack. A simple, effective defense is Binary Allowlisting via Checksums, which ensures only verified tools can run.\nFor Linux users, create a trusted baseline by running this one-time command on a clean system:\nsudo find /usr/bin -type f -exec sha256sum {} \\; > /root/trusted.sha256\nThen, schedule hourly checks using cron (edit with sudo crontab -e) to verify these binaries:\n0 * * * * sha256sum -c /root/trusted.sha256 2>&1 | grep -v \": OK$\" && echo \"Checksum mismatch detected!\" | mail -s \"Security Alert\" you@example.com\nFor Windows users, install the free, user-friendly security tool Wazuh, and enable its File Integrity Monitoring feature. It automatically alerts you if critical binaries like those in C:\\Windows\\System32 are unexpectedly changed or replaced.\nThis quick, practical approach stops attackers from sneaking through unnoticed, greatly strengthening your overall security posture.\nConclusion\nCybersecurity isn't just about technology—it's about understanding patterns, staying alert, and connecting the dots. As you finish this newsletter, ask yourself: which dot might become tomorrow's headline, and are you ready for it? Stay informed, stay curious, and keep connecting.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A new mass malware campaign is infecting users with a cryptocurrency miner named\nSilentCryptoMiner\nby masquerading it as a tool designed to circumvent internet blocks and restrictions around online services.\nRussian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said the activity is part of a larger trend where cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging Windows Packet Divert (\nWPD\n) tools to distribute malware under the guise of restriction bypass programs.\n\"Such software is often distributed in the form of archives with text installation instructions, in which the developers recommend disabling security solutions, citing false positives,\" researchers Leonid Bezvershenko, Dmitry Pikush, and Oleg Kupreev\nsaid\n. \"This plays into the hands of attackers by allowing them to persist in an unprotected system without the risk of detection.\"\nThe approach has been used as part of schemes that propagate stealers, remote access tools (RATs), trojans that provide hidden remote access, and cryptocurrency miners like NJRat, XWorm, Phemedrone, and DCRat.\nThe latest twist in this tactic is a campaign that has compromised over 2,000 Russian users with a miner disguised as a tool for getting around blocks based on deep packet inspection (DPI). The program is said to have been advertised in the form of a link to a malicious archive via a YouTube channel with 60,000 subscribers.\nIn a subsequent escalation of the tactics spotted in November 2024, the threat actors have been found impersonating such tool developers to threaten channel owners with bogus copyright strike notices and demand that they post videos with malicious links or risk getting their channels shut down due to supposed infringement.\n\"And in December 2024, users reported the distribution of a miner-infected version of the same tool through other Telegram and YouTube channels, which have since been shut down,\" Kaspersky said.\nThe booby-trapped archives have been found to pack an extra executable, with one of the legitimate batch scripts modified to run the binary via PowerShell. In the event antivirus software installed in the system interferes with the attack chain and deletes the malicious binary, users are displayed an error message that urges them to re-download the file and run it after disabling security solutions.\nThe executable is a Python-based loader that's designed to retrieve a next-stage malware, another Python script that downloads the SilentCryptoMiner miner payload and establishes persistence, but not before checking if it's running in a sandbox and configuring Windows Defender exclusions.\nThe miner, based on the open-source miner XMRig, is padded with random blocks of data to artificially inflate the file size to 690 MB and ultimately hinder automatic analysis by antivirus solutions and sandboxes.\n\"For stealth, SilentCryptoMiner employs process hollowing to inject the miner code into a system process (in this case, dwm.exe),\" Kaspersky said. \"The malware is able to stop mining while the processes specified in the configuration are active. It can be controlled remotely via a web panel.\"\nFound this article interesting?  Follow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Last August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nreleased its first three finalized post-quantum encryption standards\n, designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers. It was the latest sign of a changing security world – but what does it all mean for passwords?\nIt’s easy to see why there’s such excitement about quantum computing. By harnessing the properties of the quantum world,\ncomputers can make calculations that simply wouldn’t be possible with ‘normal’ systems\n.\nThis could transform computing as we know it, with huge potential benefits in everything from medicine to finance. However, the technology also poses significant dangers, potentially turbocharging cyberattacks.\nPrime position\nSo where is the danger? As NIST has noted, conventional cryptographic algorithms depend on “the difficulty conventional computers have with factoring large numbers”.\nThe algorithms pick two big prime numbers and multiply them to get an even larger number. A computer must reverse the process to work out which prime numbers were multiplied together if it is to break the encryption, which could take a conventional system billions of years.\nThat’s where quantum comes in. A powerful quantum computer could work through all of the potential prime factors simultaneously, instead of just one at a time, meaning that “instead of billions of years, it’s possible a quantum computer could solve this puzzle in days or even hours,” explains NIST, “putting everything from state secrets to bank account information at risk”.\nThis is tied to ‘Shor’s Algorithm’, created by Peter Shor in 1994, which could\nbreak the mathematical problems tied to public key cryptography (PKC)\nbecause it would be able to perform prime factorization much more quickly than normal computers.\nIt would need a large quantum computer to work – technology that is now nearing reality.\nSecure your Active Directory passwords with Specops Password Policy\nVerizon’s Data Breach Investigation Report found stolen credentials are involved in 44.7% of breaches.\nEffortlessly secure Active Directory with compliant password policies, blocking 4+ billion compromised passwords, boosting security, and slashing support hassles!\nTry it for free\nPost-quantum cryptography\nThat’s where post-quantum cryptography (PQC) comes in. PQC would move on from traditional public key cryptography (PKC) algorithms because it would be based on mathematical problems “believed to be intractable for both classical and quantum computers,”\nnotes the UK National Cyber Security Centre\n.\nThe new NIST standards, for instance, came from an eight-year NIST effort featuring leading cryptography experts, all with the goal of developing algorithms that could resist quantum cyberattacks.\nThe first completed standards under NIST’s PQC standardization project\nare ML-KEM (based on the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm), intended as the primary standard for general encryption; ML-DSA (which uses CRYSTALS-Dilithium), aimed at protecting digital signatures; and SLH-DSA (from Sphincs+), also focused on digital signatures.\nAdditionally, NIST is evaluating two other sets of algorithms that could serve as backup standards, it said, with one focused on general encryption (but focused on a different type of math problem than the current general-purpose algorithm) and another on digital signatures.\nIt’s important to note that they would be back-ups to the three new algorithms.\nDustin Moody, a NIST mathematician who heads the PQC standardization project, underscored the sense of urgency when he encouraged system administrators “to start integrating them into their systems immediately, because full integration takes time.”\nNew era for passwords\nSo what does this mean for the passwords we use to login online? It’s important to note that passwords aren’t going anywhere soon.\nFor one thing, we don’t yet know when the full potential of quantum computing will be realized – while it’s vital to prepare for the worst, it’s also important not to panic.\nBoth businesses and organizations will continue to rely on the advantages that password security provides, notably their simplicity, flexibility (they can easily be reset) and underlying effectiveness (they’re either right or wrong).\nIt’s more a case of building stronger locks\nto protect our important data and resources, rather than removing the locks altogether. By creating longer, more complex passwords built on greater sizes of hash keys, passwords will be more secure against attacks, even against quantum computing.\nYou should:\nFirst, check if your current password security can resist quantum attacks\nPlan how to upgrade password storage\nUse encryption that works now and remains strong against quantum computers\nImportantly, keep an eye on new security standards as they develop\nAbove all, the best way to beat hackers – even in the quantum world – will be to avoid a false choice between different security options. Optimum security depends on\nmulti-factor authentication\n, whether that’s a combination of passwords, passkeys, biometrics, or beyond.\nBlock compromised Active Directory passwords\nNo matter what, you’ll always need to stay on top of your passwords – and it’ll be even more critical under the threat of quantum computing.\nSpecops Password Policy\nprevents users from creating weak passwords, while searching for any that have been breached or compromised\n, integrating with your Active Directory to continuously block more than 4 billion compromised passwords.\nIt's never been more important to maintain a clear picture of your password security.\nReach out to learn how Specops Password Policy could fit in with your organization\n.\nSponsored and written by\nSpecops Software\n."

In August, Google increased the rewards for MiraclePtr bypasses to $250,128.\n\n\n\nThe internet giant received over 400 vulnerability reports after launching its Cloud VRP in October 2024, and handed out over $500,000 in researcher rewards. It handed out more than $290,000 in rewards for issues reported through its Abuse VRP.\n\n\n\nAs part of its AI bug bounty program, the company received over 150 bug reports, and paid out more than $55,000 in rewards.\n\n\n\nIt also handed out $370,000 in rewards as part of two bugSWAT events, including more than $87,000 for reports received during a live-hacking event targeting LLM products.Advertisement.

In fact, notable activity spikes have been observed in the US, the UK, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, Spain, and Malaysia as well.\n\n\n\n“GreyNoise’s Global Observation Grid (GOG) — a worldwide network of honeypots — detected 1,089 unique IPs attempting to exploit CVE-2024-4577 in January 2025 alone,” the cybersecurity firm notes, warning that there are 79 publicly available exploits targeting the flaw.Advertisement.
