The attacker triggers deserialization by referencing the malicious session ID in a GET request.\"\nPut differently, the attacks entail sending a PUT request containing a Base64-encoded serialized Java payload that's written to Tomcat's session storage directory, which subsequently gets executed during deserialization by sending a GET request with the JSESSIONID pointing to the malicious session.\nWallarm also noted that the vulnerability is trivial to exploit and requires no authentication. The only prerequisite is that Tomcat uses file-based session storage.\n\"While this exploit abuses session storage, the bigger issue is partial PUT handling in Tomcat, which allows uploading practically any file anywhere,\" it added. \"Attackers will soon start shifting their tactics, uploading malicious JSP files, modifying configurations, and planting backdoors outside session storage.\"\nUsers running affected versions of Tomcat are advised to update their instances as soon as possible to mitigate potential threats.\nFound this article interesting?

The end goal of these campaigns, in some cases, is to redirect the email recipient to a phishing page.\nFurthermore, it has emerged that CSS offers opportunities for threat actors to monitor user behavior via spam emails by embedding CSS properties such as the\n@media\nCSS at-rule, thus opening the door to potential fingerprinting attacks.\n\"This abuse can range from identifying recipients' font and color scheme preferences and client language to even tracking their actions (e.g., viewing or printing emails),\" Mirzaei explained.\n\"CSS provides a wide range of rules and properties that can help spammers and threat actors fingerprint users, their webmail or email client, and their system. For example, the media at-rule can detect certain attributes of a user's environment, including screen size, resolution, and color depth.\"\nTo mitigate the risk posed by such threats, it's recommended to implement advanced filtering mechanisms to detect hidden text salting and content concealment, as well as use email privacy proxies.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "From sophisticated nation-state campaigns to stealthy malware lurking in unexpected places, this week's cybersecurity landscape is a reminder that attackers are always evolving. Advanced threat groups are exploiting outdated hardware, abusing legitimate tools for financial fraud, and finding new ways to bypass security defenses. Meanwhile, supply chain threats are on the rise, with open-source repositories becoming a playground for credential theft and hidden backdoors.\nBut it's not all bad news—law enforcement is tightening its grip on cybercriminal networks, with key ransomware figures facing extradition and the security community making strides in uncovering and dismantling active threats. Ethical hackers continue to expose critical flaws, and new decryptors offer a fighting chance against ransomware operators.\nIn this week's recap, we dive into the latest attack techniques, emerging vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies to keep you ahead of the curve. Stay informed, stay secure.\n⚡ Threat of the Week\nUNC3886 Targets End-of-Life Juniper Networks MX Series Routers\n— UNC3886, a China-nexus hacking group previously known for\nbreaching edge devices and virtualization technologies\n, targeted end-of-life MX Series routers from Juniper Networks as part of a campaign designed to deploy six distinct TinyShell-based backdoors. Less than 10 organizations have been targeted as part of the campaign. \"The backdoors had varying custom capabilities, including active and passive backdoor functions, as well as an embedded script that disables logging mechanisms on the target device,\" Mandiant said. Further analysis by Juniper Networks has revealed that at least one security vulnerability (CVE-2025-21590) contributed to a successful attack that allowed the threat actors to bypass security protections and execute malicious code.\nAWS Cloud Visibility Best Practices\nYou can't secure what you can't see. Without full visibility into your AWS environment, it's easy to get buried in alerts without knowing which ones actually matter. Learn how to strengthen your AWS security posture with clear visibility and smarter risk prioritization.\nGet the guide ➝\n🔔 Top News\nStorm-1865 Uses ClickFix for Financial Fraud and Theft\n— A threat actor known as Storm-1865 has been observed leveraging the increasingly\npopular ClickFix strategy\nas part of a phishing campaign that uses Booking.com lures to direct users to credential-stealing malware. The campaign, ongoing since December 2024, casts a wide geographical net, spanning North America, Oceania, South and Southeast Asia, and Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western Europe.\nNorth Korea Targets Korean and English-Speaking Users with KoSpy\n— The North Korea-linked ScarCruft actor uploaded\nbogus Android apps to the Google Play Store\nby passing them off as seemingly innocuous utility apps that, when installed, unleashed a malware called KoSpy. It harbors features to collect SMS messages, call logs, location, files, audio, and screenshots via dynamically loaded plugins. The apps have since been removed from the app marketplace. The exact scale of the campaign remains unclear, although the earliest versions of the malware have been found as far back as March 2022.\nSideWinder Goes After Maritime and Logistics Companies\n— The advanced persistent threat (APT) group dubbed SideWinder has been linked to\nattacks targeting maritime and logistics companies\nin South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa using a modular post-exploitation toolkit called StealerBot to capture a wide range of sensitive information from compromised hosts. The attacks spread across Bangladesh, Cambodia, Djibouti, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.\nLockBit Developer Extradited to the U.S. to Face Charges\n— Rostislav Panev, a 51-year-old dual Russian and Israeli national, was extradited to the U.S. from Israel to face charges related to his alleged involvement as a\ndeveloper of the LockBit ransomware\ngroup from 2019 to February 2024. He was arrested in August 2024, a few months after the operation's online infrastructure was seized in a law enforcement exercise. Panev is said to have earned approximately $230,000 between June 2022 and February 2024.\nMalicious PyPI Packages Conduct Credential Theft\n— A collection of 20 packages uncovered on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository masqueraded as time- and cloud-related\nutilities but contained hidden functionality to steal\nsensitive data such as cloud access tokens. The packages were collectively downloaded over 14,100 times before they were removed from the PyPI repository. Three of these packages, acloud-client, enumer-iam, and tcloud-python-test, has been listed as dependencies of a relatively popular GitHub project named accesskey_tools that has been forked 42 times and starred 519 times.\n‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs\nAttackers love software vulnerabilities—they're easy doors into your systems. Every week brings fresh flaws, and waiting too long to patch can turn a minor oversight into a major breach. Below are this week's critical vulnerabilities you need to know about. Take a look, update your software promptly, and keep attackers locked out.\nThis week's list includes —\nCVE-2025-24983, CVE-2025-24984, CVE-2025-24985, CVE-2025-24991, CVE-2025-24993, CVE-2025-26633\n(Microsoft Windows),\nCVE-2025-24201\n(Apple iOS, iPadOS, macOS Sequoia, Safari, and VisionOS),\nCVE-2025-25291, CVE-2025-25292\n(ruby-saml),\nCVE-2025-27363\n(FreeType),\nCVE-2024-12297\n(Moxa PT switches),\nCVE-2025-27816\n(Arctera InfoScale product),\nCVE-2025-24813\n(Apache Tomcat),\nCVE-2025-27636\n(Apache Camel),\nCVE-2025-27017\n(Apache NiFi),\nCVE-2024-56336\n(Siemens SINAMICS S200),\nCVE-2024-13871\n,\nCVE-2024-13872\n(Bitdefender BOX v1),\nCVE-2025-20115\n(Cisco IOS XR),\nCVE-2025-27593\n(SICK DL100-2xxxxxxx),\nCVE-2025-27407\n(graphql),\nCVE-2024-54085\n(AMI),\nCVE-2025-27509\n(Fleet), and\nCVE-2024-57040\n(TP-Link TL-WR845N router).\n📰 Around the Cyber World\nGoogle Pays $11.8 Million in 2024 Bug Bounty Program\n— Google paid almost\n$12 million in bug bounty rewards\nto 660 security researchers who reported security issues through the company's Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) in 2024. It also said it awarded more than $3.3 million to researchers who uncovered critical vulnerabilities within Android and Google mobile applications. Last but not least, the company said it received 185 bug reports related to its Artificial intelligence (AI) products, netting researchers over $140,000 in rewards.\nSecurity Flaws in ICONICS Suite Disclosed\n— Five high-severity security flaws have been disclosed in a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system named ICONICS Suite – CVE-2024-1182, CVE-2024-7587, CVE-2024-8299, CVE-2024-9852, and CVE-2024-8300 – that allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code, elevate privileges, and manipulate critical files. In a real world attack aimed at industrial systems, an adversary who has already gained access to the targeted organization's systems could leverage the SCADA vulnerabilities to cause disruption and in some cases to take full control of a system. \"In combination, these vulnerabilities pose a risk to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a system,\" Palo Alto Networks Unit 42\nsaid\n.\nThreat Actors Intensify Abuse of Remote Access Tools\n— Threat actors like TA583, TA2725, and UAC-0050 are\nincreasingly using legitimate remote monitoring and management\n(RMM) tools such as ScreenConnect, Fleetdeck, Atera, and Bluetrait as a first-stage payload in email campaigns. They can be used for data collection, financial theft, lateral movement, and to install follow-on malware including ransomware. The development coincides with a decrease in prominent loaders and botnets typically used by initial access brokers. \"It's fairly easy for threat actors to create and distribute attacker-owned remote monitoring tools, and because they are often used as legitimate pieces of software, end users might be less suspicious of installing RMMs than other remote access trojans,\" Proofpoint said. \"Additionally, such tooling may evade anti-virus or network detection because the installers are often signed, legitimate payloads distributed maliciously.\"\nDecryptor for Linux Variant of Akira Ransomware Released\n— A\ndecryptor\nhas been released for the Linux/ESXI variant of Akira ransomware released in 2024 by utilizing GPU power to retrieve the decryption key and unlock files for free. It has been\nmade available\nby researcher Yohanes Nugroho on GitHub.\nVolt Typhoon Hackers Dwelled in a U.S. Electric Company for Over 300 Days\n— Chinese hackers linked to the Volt Typhoon (aka Voltzite) campaign spent nearly one year inside the systems of a major utility company in Littleton, Massachusetts. According to a\ncase study\npublished by Dragos, Littleton Electric Light and Water Departments (LELWD) discovered its systems were breached before Thanksgiving in 2023. A subsequent investigation found evidence of lateral movement by the hackers and data exfiltration, but ultimately revealed that the \"compromised information did not include any customer-sensitive data, and the utility was able to change their network architecture to remove any advantages for the adversary.\" The attackers are said to have gained access via a buggy Fortinet 300D firewall associated with a managed service provider (MSP). Dragos added: \"The significance of the discovery of this attack is that it highlights that the adversary not only aimed to maintain persistent access to the victim's environment for a long tenure, but also were aiming to exfiltrate specific data related to OT operating procedures and spatial layout data relating to energy grid operations.\" The existence of Volt Typhoon came to light in May 2023. While China has denied any involvement in the Volt Typhoon attacks, U.S. government agencies have said the threat actors are \"seeking to pre-position themselves on IT networks for disruptive or destructive cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States.\"\nLazarus Group Drops LazarLoader Malware\n— The North Korea-linked\nLazarus Group\n, which was\nmost recently implicated\nin the record-breaking\n$1.5 billion cryptocurrency theft\nfrom Bybit, has been\nobserved\ntargeting South Korean web servers to install web shells and a downloader malware dubbed LazarLoader, which then is responsible for fetching an unspecified backdoor.\nYouTube Becomes Conduit for DCRat\n— A new wave of cyber attacks utilizing the Dark Crystal RAT (\nDCRat\n) backdoor has been targeting users since early 2025 through YouTube distribution channels. The attacks\ninvolve\ncybercriminals creating or compromising YouTube accounts to upload videos advertising gaming cheats, cracks, and bots that appeal to gamers looking for such tools, tricking them into clicking on booby-trapped links embedded in the video descriptions. \"Besides backdoor capability, the trojan can load extra modules to boost its functionality,\" Kaspersky\nsaid\n. \"Throughout the backdoor's existence [since 2018], we have obtained and analyzed 34 different plugins, the most dangerous functions of which are keystroke logging, webcam access, file grabbing and password exfiltration.\" Telemetry data gathered by the Russian cybersecurity company shows that a majority of the DCRat samples were downloaded to the devices of users in Russia, and to a lesser extent among users from Belarus, Kazakhstan, and China.\nNew Social Engineering Campaigns Aimed at Microsoft 356 Account Takeover\n— Proofpoint is warning of two ongoing, highly targeted campaigns that combine OAuth redirection mechanisms with brand impersonation techniques, malware proliferation, and Microsoft 365-themed credential phishing to facilitate account takeover (ATO) attacks. It said it discovered three malicious OAuth apps, disguised as Adobe Drive, Adobe Acrobat, and Docusign, which are used to redirect users to web pages hosting phishing and malware delivery threats. \"To avoid detection solutions, the observed apps were assigned limited scopes (such as profile, email, openid,\" it\nsaid\n.\nWi-Fi Jamming Technique Enables Precision DoS Attack\n— New research has demonstrated a sophisticated Wi-Fi jamming technique that's capable of disabling individual devices with millimeter-level precision by leveraging Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology. \"In particular, we propose a novel approach that allows for environment-adaptive spatial control of wireless jamming signals, granting a new degree of freedom to perform jamming attacks,\" a group of academics from Ruhr University Bochum and Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy\nsaid\n. \"Using RIS-based environment-adaptive wireless channel control, allowing to maximize and minimize wireless signals on specific locations [27], the attacker gains spatial control over their wireless jamming signals. This opens the door to precise jamming signal delivery towards a target device, disrupting any legitimate signal reception, while leaving other, non-target devices, untouched.\"\nHash DoS Flaw in QUIC Implementations\n— Multiple Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol implementations have been found susceptible to a hash denial-of-service (DoS) attack. \"By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker is able to significantly slow down vulnerable servers,\" NCC Group\nsaid\n. \"This vulnerability allows attackers to stall the server by forcing it to spend the majority of its computing power inserting and looking up colliding connection IDs.\"\nExposed Jupyter Notebooks Become Cryptominer Targets\n— A new evasive campaign is targeting misconfigured Jupyter Notebooks installed on both Windows and Linus systems to deliver a cryptocurrency miner. The payloads take the form of MSI installers and ELF binaries that are designed to drop the miner that singles out Monero, Sumokoin, ArQma, Graft, Ravencoin, Wownero, Zephyr, Townforge, and YadaCoin. Cado Security, which\ndetected\nthe activity against its honeypot network, said it also observed a parallel campaign targeting servers running PHP to distribute the same miner. Furthermore, some of the intermediate artifacts used in the campaign have been observed in prior attacks targeting\nSouth Korean web servers\nas well as Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) instances\nvulnerable\nto CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887.\nESP32 Chip Backdoor Claims Disputed\n— Espressif, the manufacturer of ESP32, a low-cost, low-power microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth capabilities, has pushed back against claims of a backdoor in its products. Researchers at Tarlogic initially\nsaid\nthey had found a \"backdoor\" in ESP32 that could \"allow hostile actors to conduct impersonation attacks and permanently infect sensitive devices such as mobile phones, computers, smart locks, or medical equipment by bypassing code audit controls.\" The research has since been updated to make it clear that it's more of a \"hidden functionality that can be used as a backdoor.\" It also said that the commands could facilitate supply chain attacks or other stealthy compromises. In response to the disclosure, Espressif pointed out that the\n29 undocumented commands\nin question are not accessible remotely, but noted it will provide a software fix to remove them from the code. \"The functionality found are debug commands included for testing purposes,\" it\nadded\n. \"These debug commands are part of Espressif's implementation of the HCI (Host Controller Interface) protocol used in Bluetooth technology. This protocol is used internally in a product to communicate between Bluetooth layers.\" ESP32-C, ESP32-S and ESP32-H series chips are not impacted by the issue, which is now tracked as\nCVE-2025-27840\n(CVSS score: 6.8).\nSwitzerland Makes it Mandatory to Disclose Critical Infra Attacks\n— The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of Switzerland has announced that critical infrastructure organizations will be required to report cyberattacks to the NCSC within 24 hours of discovery starting April 1, 2025. \"Examples of when a cyberattack must be reported include when it threatens the functioning of critical infrastructure, has resulted in the manipulation or leakage of information, or involves blackmail, threats or coercion,\" the NCSC\nsaid\n. \"Critical infrastructure operators who fail to report a cyberattack may be fined.\"\nBugs in Microsoft's Time Travel Debugging (TTD) Framework\n— Google-owned Mandiant has detailed its security analysis of the Time Travel Debugging (\nTTD\n) framework, a\nrecord-and-replay debugging tool\nfor Windows user-mode applications. Given that TTD leans on CPU instruction emulation to reproduce issues, \"subtle inaccuracies\" in the process could have serious consequences, potentially allowing critical security flaws to slip undetected. Even worse, it could be deliberately abused by attackers to bypass analysis. The four identified issues have been addressed in TTD version 1.11.410. \"The observed discrepancies, while subtle, underscore a broader security concern: even minor deviations in emulation behavior can misrepresent the true execution of code, potentially masking vulnerabilities or misleading forensic investigations,\" Mandiant\nsaid\n.\nNIST Chooses HQC as Fifth Post-Quantum Crypto Algorithm\n— The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has selected\nHQC\n(short for Hamming Quasi-Cyclic) as backup algorithm as a \"second line of defense\" against the\nthreat posed by a future quantum computer\n. \"The new algorithm, called HQC, will serve as a backup defense in case quantum computers are someday able to crack ML-KEM,\" NIST\nsaid\n. \"Both these algorithms are designed to protect stored information as well as data that travels across public networks.\" According to Dustin Moody, who heads NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography project, HQC is not intended to replace ML-KEM.\nGoing from BYOVD to BYOTB to BYOVE\n— Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (\nBYOVD\n) is a known attack technique that involves a threat actor using a legitimate but vulnerable driver -- that's either already pre-installed on the host or introduced to a target environment -- with the goal of gaining elevated privileges and perform malicious actions, such as disabling security software. This approach has been adopted by various threat actors such as\nBlackByte\n,\nKasseika\n,\nRansomHub\n(Water Bakunawa), and\nLazarus Group\n. But new research published in recent weeks has shown that the technique can be exploited in conjunction with symbolic links (aka symlinks) to exploit a broader set of drivers. \"With the new attack method that combines the file writing functionality of drivers and Windows Symbolic Links, attackers are relieved from the restriction of needing to find vulnerable drivers that are not yet on the blocklist to exploit,\" Zero Salarium researcher Nicky Thompson\nsaid\n. \"Instead, they only need to identify any driver that has file writing capabilities, such as logging, tracing, etc. Merging with the abuse of symbolic links, BYOVD technique will evolve to a new level.\" The approach can be further extended to what's called a Bring Your Own Trusted Binary (\nBYOTB\n), which involves using legitimate binaries (e.g.,\ncloudflared\n) in an adversarial manner, and Bring Your Own Vulnerable Enclave (BYOVE), which makes use of vulnerable versions of legitimate\nenclaves\nto run malicious code without attracting attention -- a memory evasion technique codenamed Mirage. While enclave modules have to be signed with a Microsoft-issued certificate to load, a threat actor could rely on an operating system flaw (\nCVE-2024-49706\n) to load an unsigned module into an enclave, obtain access to a\nTrusted Signing\nentity and sign their own enclaves, or even abuse debuggable and vulnerable enclaves (e.g.,\nCVE-2023-36880\n) to read and write arbitrary data inside the enclave. \"This could be useful in many scenarios — by storing payloads out of the reach of EDRs, sealing encryption keys hidden away from analysts, or keeping sensitive malware configuration out of memory dumps,\" Akamai researcher Ori David\nsaid\n. Another technique to blind security solutions involves a\nnew path masquerading approach\nthat employs \"whitespace\" characters in Unicode to spoof the execution path of any program to resemble that of an antivirus.\n🎥 Cybersecurity Webinars\nLearn How to Eliminate Identity-Based Threats\n— Despite massive security investments, identity-based attacks like phishing and MFA bypass continue to thrive.

Leveraging direct syscall execution, memory analysis, and syscall hooking detection, ZeroProbe enables stealthy, forensic-friendly security assessments on Windows 10, 11, and Server 2019, compatible across PowerShell versions.\n🔒 Tip of the Week\nDetecting Threat Actors Early with Sysmon and Event ID 4688\n— Attackers rely heavily on running unusual or malicious processes—such as encoded PowerShell commands, uncommon scripts, or tools like certutil.exe or rundll32.exe—to escalate privileges and evade detection. Deploying Microsoft Sysmon combined with built-in Windows Event ID 4688 (Process Creation) auditing helps capture these actions early, significantly reducing the risk of compromise. Sysmon provides detailed logs on process activities, file creation, and network connections, enabling defenders to spot anomalies quickly.\nFor practical implementation, install Sysmon with a trusted, community-driven configuration (like\nSwiftOnSecurity's config\n), and enable Windows process auditing through group policies or the command line. Then, automate detection and alerting using free SIEM solutions like\nElastic Stack\n(ELK) or Graylog, easily integrating Sysmon and Windows logs for real-time visibility and rapid threat response.\nConclusion\nCyber threats aren't just evolving—they're adapting to security controls, exploiting human behavior, and weaponizing legitimate technologies. This week's developments highlight a critical reality: outdated infrastructure isn't just a liability, it's an invitation. Trusting signed software blindly? That's a risk. Assuming major platforms are inherently secure? That's an oversight.\nThreat actors are shifting tactics faster than many defenses can keep up. They're embedding malware in everyday tools, leveraging phishing beyond mere credential theft, and manipulating vulnerabilities that most organizations overlook. The lesson? Security isn't about reacting to the breach—it's about anticipating the next move.\nAs defenders, our edge isn't just in patching vulnerabilities but in understanding the mindset of attackers. Every breach, every exploit, and every overlooked detail is a signal: the threat landscape doesn't wait, and neither should our response. Stay proactive, stay skeptical, and stay ahead.\nFound this article interesting?  Follow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "The latest Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 Cloud Threat Report found that sensitive data is found in 66% of cloud storage buckets. This data is vulnerable to ransomware attacks. The SANS Institute\nrecently reported\nthat these attacks can be performed by abusing the cloud provider's storage security controls and default settings.\n\"In just the past few months, I have witnessed two different methods for executing a ransomware attack using nothing but legitimate cloud security features,\" warns Brandon Evans, security consultant and SANS Certified Instructor. Halcyon disclosed an attack campaign that leveraged one of Amazon S3's native encryption mechanisms, SSE-C, to encrypt each of the target buckets. A few months prior, security consultant Chris Farris demonstrated how attackers could perform a similar attack using a different AWS security feature, KMS keys with external key material, using simple scripts generated by ChatGPT. \"Clearly, this topic is top-of-mind for both threat actors and researchers alike,\" notes Brandon.\nTo address cloud ransomware, SANS recommends organizations to:\nUnderstand the power and limitations of cloud security controls:\nUsing the cloud does not automatically make your data safe. \"The first cloud services most people use are file backup solutions like OneDrive, Dropbox, iCloud, and others,\" explains Brandon. \"While these services usually have file recovery capabilities enabled by default, this is not the case for Amazon S3, Azure Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. It is critical for security professionals to understand how these services work and not assume that the cloud will save them.\"\nBlock unsupported cloud encryption methods:\nAWS S3 SSE-C, AWS KMS external key material, and similar encryption techniques can be abused because the attacker has full control over the keys. Organizations can use Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to mandate the encryption method used by S3, such as SSE-KMS using key material hosted in AWS.\nEnable backups, object versioning, and object locking:\nThese are some of the integrity and availability controls for cloud storage. None of them are enabled by default for any of the Big 3 cloud providers. If used properly, they can increase the chances that an organization can recover its data after a ransomware attack.\nBalance security and cost with data lifecycle policies:\nThese security features cost money. \"The cloud providers are not going to host your data versions or backups for free. At the same time, your organization is not going to give you a blank check for data security,\" says Brandon. Each of the Big 3 cloud providers allows customers to define a lifecycle policy. These policies allow organizations to automatically delete objects, versions, and backups when they are no longer considered necessary. Be aware, however, that attackers can leverage lifecycle policies as well. They were used in the previously mentioned attack campaign to urge the target to pay the ransom quickly.\nTo learn more, watch Brandon's webcast, \"The Cloud Won't Save You from Ransomware: Here's What Will\", by visiting\nhttps://www.sans.org/webcasts/cloud-wont-save-you-from-ransomware-heres-what-will/\nInterested in additional tactics for mitigating attacks in the Big 3 cloud providers?

It's used to track and retrieve all changed files and directories.\nThe supply chain compromise has been assigned the CVE identifier\nCVE-2025-30066\n(CVSS score: 8.6). The incident is said to have taken place sometime before March 14, 2025.\n\"In this attack, the attackers modified the action's code and retroactively updated multiple version tags to reference the malicious commit,\" StepSecurity\nsaid\n. \"The compromised Action prints CI/CD secrets in GitHub Actions build logs.\"\nThe net result of this behavior is that should the workflow logs be publicly accessible, they could lead to the unauthorized exposure of sensitive secrets when the action is run on the repositories.\nThis includes AWS access keys, GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs), npm tokens, and private RSA Keys, among others. That said, there is no evidence that the leaked secrets were siphoned to any attacker-controlled infrastructure.\nSpecifically, the\nmaliciously inserted code\nis designed to run a Python script hosted on a GitHub gist that dumps the CI/CD secrets from the Runner Worker process. It's said to have originated from an unverified source code commit. The GitHub gist has since been taken down.\n\"tj-actions/change-files is used in an organization's software development pipelines,\" Dimitri Stiliadis, CTO and co-founder of Endor Labs, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. \"After developers write and review code, they typically publish into the main branch of their repository. From there 'pipelines' take it, build it for production, and deploy it.\"\n\"tj-actions/change-files helps detect file changes in a repository. It allows you to check which files have been added, modified, or deleted between commits, branches, or pull requests.\"\n\"The attackers\nmodified the action's code\nand retroactively updated multiple version tags to reference the malicious commit. The compromised Action now executes a malicious Python script that dumps CI/CD secrets, impacting thousands of CI pipelines.\"\nThe project maintainers have stated that the unknown threat actor(s) behind the incident managed to compromise a GitHub personal access token (PAT) used by @tj-actions-bot, a bot with privileged access to the compromised repository.\nFollowing the discovery, the account's password has been updated, authentication has been upgraded to use a passkey, and its permissions levels have been updated such that it follows the principle of least privilege. GitHub has also revoked the compromised PAT.\n\"The Personal access token affected was stored as a GitHub action secret which has since been revoked,\" the maintainers\nadded\n. \"Going forward no PAT would be used for all projects in the tj-actions organization to prevent any risk of reoccurrence.\"\nAnyone who uses the GitHub Action is advised to update to the\nlatest version\n(46.0.1) as soon as possible. Users are also advised to review all workflows executed between March 14 and March 15 and check for \"unexpected output under the changed-files section.\"\nThis is not the first time a security issue has been flagged in the tj-actions/changed-files Action. In January 2024, security researcher Adnan Khan\nrevealed\ndetails of a critical flaw (\nCVE-2023-49291\n, CVSS score: 9.8) affecting tj-actions/changed-files and tj-actions/branch-names that could pave the way for arbitrary code execution.\nThe development once again underscores how open-source software remains particularly susceptible to supply chain risks, which could then have serious consequences for several downstream customers at once.\n\"As of March 15, 2025, all versions of tj-actions/changed-files were found to be affected, as the attacker managed to modify existing version tags to make them all point to their malicious code,\" cloud security firm Wiz\nsaid\n.\n\"Customers who were using a hash-pinned version of tj-actions/changed-files would not be impacted, unless they had updated to an impacted hash during the exploitation timeframe.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The malware then gains capabilities to launch applications with these newly obtained privileges.\"\nThe RAT's capabilities also include extensive detection evasion and anti-forensics features, like the ability to clear event logs and check for signs that it's running in a sandbox to block malware analysis attempts. Even if tricked into running in a sandbox, StilachiRAT's Windows API calls are encoded as \"checksums that are resolved dynamically at runtime\" and further obfuscated to slow down analysis.\nLast but not least, Microsoft says StilachiRAT allows command execution and potential SOCKS-like proxying using commands from a command-and-control (C2) server to the infected devices, which can let the threat actors reboot the compromised system, clear logs, steal credentials, execute applications, and manipulate system windows.\nOther commands are designed to \"suspend the system, modify Windows registry values, and enumerate open windows.\"\nTo reduce the attack surface this malware can use to compromise a targeted system, Microsoft advises downloading software only from official websites and using security software that can block malicious domains and email attachments.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nHave I Been Pwned adds 284M accounts stolen by infostealer malware\nMassJacker malware uses 778,000 wallets to steal cryptocurrency\nMicrosoft says malvertising campaign impacted 1 million PCs\nGitVenom attacks abuse hundreds of GitHub repos to steal crypto\nCrypto-stealing apps found in Apple App Store for the first time"

Worse, base64 encoding allows the exploit to bypass most traditional security filters, making detection challenging.\"\nThe Tomcat RCE\nThe\nCVE-2025-24813\nremote code execution vulnerability flaw was first disclosed by Apache on Monday 10, 2025, impacting Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.34, and 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.98.\nThe\nsecurity bulletin\nwarned users that, under certain conditions, an attacker could view or inject arbitrary content on security-sensitive files.\nThe conditions were the following:\nWrites enabled for the default servlet (readonly= \"false\") — (Disabled by default)\nSupport for partial PUT is enabled (Enabled by default.)\nSecurity-sensitive uploads occur in a sub-directory of a public upload directory.\nThe attacker knows the names of security-sensitive files being uploaded.\nThese security-sensitive files are being uploaded using partial PUT.\nApache recommended that all users upgrade to Tomcat versions 11.0.3+, 10.1.35+, or 9.0.99+, which are patched against CVE-2025-24813.\nTomcat users may also mitigate the problem by reverting to the default servlet configuration (readonly= \"true\"), turning off partial PUT support, and avoiding storing security-sensitive files in a subdirectory of public upload paths.\nWallarm warns that the bigger issue highlighted in this case isn't the exploitation activity itself but the potential for more RCE vulnerabilities arising from the partial PUT handling in Tomcat.\n\"Attackers will soon start shifting their tactics, uploading malicious JSP files, modifying configurations, and planting backdoors outside session storage.

It plans to issue a draft HQC standard in early 2026, with the finalized standard expected in 2027.\nIn a report (PDF) on the fourth round of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, NIST states, “The only key-establishment algorithm that will be standardized is HQC, and NIST will develop a standard based on HQC to augment its key-establishment portfolio.”\n\n\n\nFour other algorithms have already been selected, and three of these have been released as finished standards: FIPS 203 is ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber), FIPS 204 is ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium), and FIPS 205 is SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+). FIPS 206 is planned for the fourth standardization and built around FALCON — the draft standard is due to be released shortly as FIPS 206, FN-DSA.\n\n\n\nHQC will serve as a backup for ML-KEM. Both are key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs). KEMs are used to establish a shared secret key over a public channel. That shared secret key can then be used for data encrypted with a symmetric-key encryption system (such as AES-256).\n\n\n\nSymmetric algorithms are considered less vulnerable to quantum decryption when their key lengths are long enough — AES-256 is considered to be quantum resistant and there is, for the moment, no emphasis on replacing such symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\nThe DSA epithet in the standards refers to ‘digital signature algorithm’, described by NIST as, “a kind of ‘electronic fingerprint’ that authenticates the identity of a sender, such as when remotely signing documents.”\n\n\n\nJust as Sphincs+ is included as a backup for Dilithium and FALCON, so HQC is included as a backup for ML-KEM. The ‘KEM’ epithet stands for ‘key encapsulation mechanism’. Logically, this fifth standardization is likely to be FIPS  207, xx-KEM.\n\n\n\nFirst choices for both KEMs and DSAs are already standardized, and organizations should not wait for the backups to be available before migrating to PQC. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“Organizations should continue to migrate their encryption systems to the standards NIST finalized in 2024. We are announcing the selection of HQC because we want to have a backup standard that is based on a different math approach than ML-KEM,” explains Dustin Moody, NIST mathematician and project head.\n\n\n\nDespite the future option of HQC, ML-KEM remains the recommended first choice for migration to PQC. Its algorithm is built around the mathematics of structured lattices. HQC uses different math, built around error-correcting codes. Its algorithm is lengthier and requires more computing resources than Kyber, but Moody noted, “Its clean and secure operation convinced reviewers that it would make a worthy backup choice.”\n\n\n\nWithin the DSA category, Dilithium (FIPS 204, ML-DSA) is the primary recommendation. The FALCON algorithm (expected to be FIPS 206, FN-DSA) is recommended for applications that require a smaller signature than can be provided by Dilithium. Sphincs+ (FIPS 205 SLH-DSA) is larger and slower than the others but is a useful backup since it uses different math based on cryptographic hash functions.\n\n\n\nThe availability of backups provides options for crypto agility (which could also be called ‘just in case crypto’). NIST urges that migration to PQC should include crypto agility, so that just in case an installed encryption fails or gets broken, an adequate alternative can be swiftly swapped in.\n\n\n\nWith the coming addition of HQC, NIST now has a complete set of first choice and backup post quantum encryption algorithms.\n\n\n\nRelated: Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards Officially Announced by NIST – a History and Explanation\nRelated: US Government Publishes Guidance on Migrating to Post-Quantum Cryptography\nRelated: NIST Post-Quantum Algorithm Finalist Cracked Using a Classical PC\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Quantum and the Threat to Encryption\n\nIn a report (PDF) on the fourth round of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, NIST states, “The only key-establishment algorithm that will be standardized is HQC, and NIST will develop a standard based on HQC to augment its key-establishment portfolio.”\n\n\n\nFour other algorithms have already been selected, and three of these have been released as finished standards: FIPS 203 is ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber), FIPS 204 is ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium), and FIPS 205 is SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+).

Most of the flaws were found in plugins (7,633 defects, representing 96% of the total), and a small percentage in themes (326, or 4%).\n\n\n\nAccording to Patchstack, despite their large number, most of the vulnerabilities did not pose an active threat: 69.6% were considered unlikely to be exploited, 18.8% could be exploited in targeted attacks, and only 11.6% were exploited or expected to be.\n\n\n\nThe CVSS score assigned to these vulnerabilities tell a similar story: more than two-thirds were rated low or medium severity, and only one-third were rated high or critical severity.\n\n\n\nHowever, Patchstack also notes that 43% of the WordPress security defects uncovered in 2024 could be exploited without authentication, although some of them required interaction from an authenticated user.\n\n\n\nRoughly 43% of other vulnerabilities required the attacker to have low privileges, such as contributor or subscriber, and 12% required privileges such as administrator, author, or editor.  \n\n\n\nNearly half of the WordPress flaws documented last year were cross-site scripting issues (47.7%), with broken access control (14.19%) and cross-site request forgery (11.35%) rounding up the top three.\n\n\n\nA total of 1,018 issues were found in plugins with more than 100,000 installations, including 115 in plugins with more than 1 million installations.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nVulnerabilities in Nvidia Riva could allow hackers to abuse speech and translation AI services that are typically expensive. \nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nNvidia recently patched a couple of Riva vulnerabilities that could allow hackers to abuse AI services.\nRiva is a set of GPU-accelerated multilingual speech and translation services designed for building customizable, real-time conversational AI for large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\n\n\nA security advisory published by Nvidia on March 10 reveals that Riva is impacted by two improper access control issues. One of the flaws, tracked as CVE-2025-23242 and assigned a ‘high severity’ rating, can allow privilege escalation, data tapering, denial of service (DoS), and information disclosure.\n\n\n\nThe second vulnerability, CVE-2025-23243, is a medium-severity issue allowing data tampering and DoS attacks.\n\n\n\nThe security holes impact versions 2.18 and prior of Nvidia Riva on Linux. A patch is included in version 2.19.0.\n\n\n\nThe vulnerabilities were discovered by Trend Micro researchers and reported to Nvidia in November 2024. Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative has published individual advisories for CVE-2025-23242 and CVE-2025-23243, noting that they can both be exploited without authentication. \n\n\n\nAlfredo Oliveira, one of the Trend Micro security researchers credited for reporting these vulnerabilities, told SecurityWeek that while Riva instances should not be exposed to the internet, the research was actually triggered by the discovery of web-facing systems.\n\n\n\nOliveira explained that they have identified several vulnerable Riva instances exposed to the internet due to a misconfiguration that was caught by Trend Micro solutions.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“The default cloud installation creates a network rule exposing the service to 0.0.0.0/0 (whole internet),” the researcher explained.\n\n\n\nAn attacker who finds a vulnerable Riva instance could use the associated service without authorization.\n\n\n\n“Riva is an AI Speech service — it does translations, speech-to-text and text-to-speech generation, among other things. Both the license and infrastructure to run these are very expensive, abusing this system would cause a considerable financial impact,” Oliveira said.\n\n\n\nRelated: Chipmaker Patch Tuesday: Intel, AMD, Nvidia Fix High-Severity Vulnerabilities\nRelated: Nvidia, Zoom, Zyxel Patch High-Severity Vulnerabilities\nRelated: Nvidia Patches High-Severity Flaws in Windows, Linux Graphics Drivers\n\nRiva is a set of GPU-accelerated multilingual speech and translation services designed for building customizable, real-time conversational AI for large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\n\n\nA security advisory published by Nvidia on March 10 reveals that Riva is impacted by two improper access control issues.

Tj-actions provides GitHub Actions for streamlining CI/CD processes. Changed-files, which is actively used in over 23,000 repositories, is designed for tracking file and directory changes.\n\n\n\nAccording to StepSecurity, a security company specializing in GitHub Actions, the incident started on March 14 and involved a threat actor modifying the Changed-files code to execute a malicious Python script designed to dump CI/CD secrets to build logs.\n\n\n\n“If the workflow logs are publicly accessible (such as in public repositories), anyone could potentially read these logs and obtain exposed secrets,” StepSecurity said.\n\n\n\nWhile the security firm has seen multiple public repositories leaking secrets in build logs that can be accessed by anyone, it noted that there is no evidence of the leaked secrets being exfiltrated. \n\n\n\nA majority of the existing Changed-files version tags were updated to refer to the malicious commit. The CVE identifier CVE-2025-30066 has been assigned to this incident. \n\n\n\nSoftware supply chain security firm Endor Labs has also tracked this incident and found no evidence that downstream open source libraries or containers have been impacted.\n\n\n\n“The attacker was likely not looking for secrets in public repositories — they are already public. They were likely looking to compromise the software supply chain for other open source libraries, binaries, and artifacts created with this. Any public repository that creates packages or containers as part of a CI pipeline could have been impacted. That means potentially 1,000s of open source packages have the potential to have been compromised,” Endor said in a blog post.Advertisement.

If these repositories share CI/CD pipeline secrets for artifact or container registries these registries can be potentially compromised,” the company added.\n\n\n\nOn March 15, GitHub removed the tj-actions/changed-files action and restored it on the same day after the malicious commit was removed from all tags and branches. \n\n\n\nTj-actions developers and the security firms have shared recommendations on checking for indicators of compromise (IoCs) and incident response steps. \n\n\n\nThere has been some speculation regarding this incident, with some believing that it may have been an attack conducted by an unsophisticated threat actor or that it was just an attempt to raise awareness of the potential risks.\n\n\n\nOne researcher pointed out that one year ago he published a blog post describing a theoretical attack scenario targeting tj-actions/changed-files.\n\n\n\nRelated: GitHub Actions Artifacts Leak Tokens and Expose Cloud Services and Repositories\nRelated: GitLoker Strikes Again: New “Goissue” Tool Targets GitHub Developers and Corporate Supply Chains\nRelated: North Korean Fake IT Workers Pose as Blockchain Developers on GitHub\nRelated: GitHub Launches Fund to Improve Open Source Project Security\n\nThe targeted GitHub Action is called ‘tj-actions/changed-files’.

They were likely looking to compromise the software supply chain for other open source libraries, binaries, and artifacts created with this. Any public repository that creates packages or containers as part of a CI pipeline could have been impacted. That means potentially 1,000s of open source packages have the potential to have been compromised,” Endor said in a blog post.Advertisement.
