        "Content": "The threat actors behind the zero-day exploitation of a recently-patched security vulnerability in Microsoft Windows have been found to deliver two new backdoors called\nSilentPrism\nand\nDarkWisp\n.\nThe activity has been attributed to a suspected Russian hacking group called\nWater Gamayun\n, which is also known as EncryptHub and LARVA-208.\n\"The threat actor deploys payloads primarily by means of malicious provisioning packages, signed .msi files, and Windows MSC files, using techniques like the IntelliJ runnerw.exe for command execution,\" Trend Micro researchers Aliakbar Zahravi and Ahmed Mohamed Ibrahim\nsaid\nin a follow-up analysis published last week.\nWater Gamayun has been linked to the active exploitation of CVE-2025-26633 (aka MSC EvilTwin), a vulnerability in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) framework, to execute malware by means of a rogue Microsoft Console (.msc) file.\nThe attack chains involve the use of provisioning packages (.ppkg), signed Microsoft Windows Installer files (.msi), and .msc files to deliver information stealers and backdoors that are capable of persistence and data theft.\nEncryptHub\ngained attention\ntowards the end of June 2024, after having used a GitHub repository named \"encrypthub\" to push various kinds of malware families, including stealers, miners, and ransomware, via a\nfake WinRAR website\n. The threat actors have since transitioned to their infrastructure for both staging and command-and-control (C&C) purposes.\nThe .msi installers used in the attacks masquerade as legitimate messaging and meeting software such as DingTalk, QQTalk, and VooV Meeting. They are designed to execute a PowerShell downloader, which is then used to fetch and run the next-stage payload on a compromised host.\nOne such malware is a PowerShell implant dubbed SilentPrism that can set up persistence, execute multiple shell commands simultaneously, and maintain remote control, while also incorporating anti-analysis techniques to evade detection. Another PowerShell backdoor of note is DarkWisp, which enables system reconnaissance, exfiltration of sensitive data, and persistence.\n\"Once the malware exfiltrates reconnaissance and system information to the C&C server, it enters a continuous loop waiting for commands,\" the researchers said. \"The malware accepts commands through a TCP connection on port 8080, where commands arrive in the format COMMAND|<base64_encoded_command>.\"\n\"The main communication loop ensures continuous interaction with the server, handling commands, maintaining connectivity, and securely transmitting results.\"\nThe third payload dropped in the attacks is the MSC EvilTwin loader that weaponizes CVE-2025-26633 to execute a malicious .msc file, ultimately leading to the deployment of the Rhadamanthys Stealer. The loader is also designed to perform a cleanup of the system to avoid leaving a forensic trail.\nRhadamanthys is far from the only stealer in Water Gamayun's arsenal, for it has been observed delivering another commodity stealer called StealC, as well as three custom PowerShell variants referred to as EncryptHub Stealer variant A, variant B, and variant C.\nThe bespoke stealer is fully-featured malware that can collect extensive system information, including details about antivirus software, installed software, network adapters, and running applications. It also extracts Wi-Fi passwords, Windows product keys, clipboard history, browser credentials, and session data from various apps related to messaging, VPN, FTP, and password management.\nFurthermore, it specifically singles out files matching certain keywords and extensions, indicating a focus on gathering recovery phrases associated with cryptocurrency wallets.\n\"These variants exhibit similar functionalities and capabilities, with only minor modifications distinguishing them,\" the researchers noted. \"All EncryptHub variants covered in this research are modified versions of the open-source\nKematian Stealer\n.\"\nOne iteration of EncryptHub Stealer is noteworthy for the use of a new living-off-the-land binary (LOLBin) technique in which the IntelliJ process launcher \"runnerw.exe\" is used to proxy the execution of a remote PowerShell script on an infected system.\nThe stealer artifacts, distributed through malicious MSI packages or binary malware droppers, have also been found to propagate other malware families like Lumma Stealer, Amadey, and\nclippers\n.\nFurther analysis of the threat actor's C&C infrastructure (\"82.115.223[.]182\") has revealed the use of other PowerShell scripts to download and execute AnyDesk software for remote access and the ability of the operators to send Base64-encoded remote commands to the victim machine.\n\"Water Gamayun's use of various delivery methods and techniques in its campaign, such as provisioning malicious payloads through signed Microsoft Installer files and leveraging LOLBins, highlights their adaptability in compromising victims' systems and data,\" Trend Micro said.\n\"Their intricately designed payloads and C&C infrastructure enable the threat actor to maintain persistence, dynamically control infected systems, and obfuscate their activities.\"\nFound this article interesting?

A misconfigured setting, an overlooked vulnerability, or a too-convenient cloud tool becomes the perfect entry point. But what happens when the hunters become the hunted? Or when old malware resurfaces with new tricks?\nStep behind the curtain with us this week as we explore breaches born from routine oversights—and the unexpected cracks they reveal in systems we trust.\n⚡ Threat of the Week\nGoogle Patches Actively Exploited Chrome 0-Day\n— Google has\naddressed\na high-severity security flaw in its Chrome browser for Windows that has been exploited by unknown actors as part of a sophisticated attack aimed at Russian entities. The flaw, CVE-2025-2783 (CVSS score: 8.3), is said to have been combined with another exploit to break out of the browser's sandbox and achieve remote code execution. The attacks involved distributing specially crafted links via phishing emails that, when clicked and launched using Chrome, triggered the exploit. A\nsimilar flaw\nhas since been patched in Mozilla Firefox and Tor Browser (CVE-2025-2857), although there is no evidence that it has been exploited.\nGartner® Market Guide for Adversarial Exposure Validation\nAre you facing a constant barrage of new threats and attack scenarios? Then check out the latest Gartner® Market Guide, \"Market Guide for Adversarial Exposure Validation\" now and learn how to assess your readiness against evolving cybersecurity challenges. Grab your complimentary copy today.\nDownload Now ➝\n🔔 Top News\nCritical Flaws Uncovered in Ingress NGINX Controller for Kubernetes\n— A set of vulnerabilities, collectively named\nIngressNightmare\n, has been disclosed in the Ingress NGINX Controller for Kubernetes that could result in unauthenticated remote code execution. The most severe of the five flaws is CVE-2025-1974 (CVSS score: 9.8), which an unauthenticated attacker with access to the pod network could exploit to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller under certain conditions. Following responsible disclosure, the vulnerabilities have been addressed in Ingress NGINX Controller versions 1.12.1, 1.11.5, and 1.10.7.\nBlackLock Data Leak Site Exposed\n— Threat hunters have\nmanaged\nto infiltrate the data leak site associated with a ransomware group called BlackLock, uncovering crucial information about their modus operandi in the process. Thanks to a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, cybersecurity company Resecurity said it was able to extract configuration files, credentials, as well as the history of commands executed on the server. The threat actors have been found using Rclone to exfiltrate data to the MEGA cloud storage service. As many as eight accounts have been created on MEGA to store and backup victim data. The development comes as KELA revealed the possible real-world identities of Rey and Pryx, the key players driving the\nHellcat\nransomware operations. Rey (aka Saif and Hikki-Chan) is likely of Palestinian and Jordanian origin, while Pryx (aka Adem) is said to be an Arabic speaker involved in carding since 2018. \"Ironically, Rey and Pryx, who heavily relied on info stealer logs in their operations, fell victim to it themselves,\" KELA\nsaid\n.\n46 Flaws in Solar Inverters From Sungrow, Growatt, and SMA\n— As many as 46 security bugs have\ndiscovered\nin products from three solar inverter vendors, Sungrow, Growatt, and SMA that, if successfully exploited, could permit attackers to seize control of devices and cause potential power blackouts. The vulnerabilities, collectively named SUN:DOWN, \"can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands on devices or the vendor's cloud, take over accounts, gain a foothold in the vendor's infrastructure, or take control of inverter owners' devices.\"\nRedCurl Linked to First Case of Ransomware\n— RedCurl, a threat actor known for its corporate espionage attacks since late 2018, has been\nobserved\ndelivering a custom ransomware family called QWCrypt via a sophisticated multi-stage infection chain. Bitdefender, which flagged the activity, said the \"unusual deviation\" in tactics raises more questions than answers about their motivations, raising the possibility that it may be either a cyber mercenary group or it's a discreet operation designed to generate consistent revenue.\nHackers Using Atlantis AIO for Credential Stuffing and Brute-Force Attacks\n— Threat actors are making use of an e-crime tool called\nAtlantis AIO\nMulti-Checker to automate credential stuffing attacks across more than 140 platforms, allowing them to test millions of stolen credentials in \"rapid succession.\" The software also comes with capabilities to conduct brute-force attacks against email platforms and automate account recovery processes associated with eBay and Yahoo.\nWeaver Ant Goes Undetected for Over 4 Years\n— A suspected Chinese state-backed hacking group called\nWeaver Ant\nmanaged to stay under the radar after it breached a major telecommunications company located in Asia. The attack involved the exploitation of a misconfiguration in a public-facing application to gain initial access and drop web shells for persistent remote access. The web shells were then used to drop additional payloads to facilitate lateral movement and carry out reconnaissance activities. Over the past year, Chinese hacking crews have also\ntargeted\na trade group in the United States and a research institute in Mexico to deliver ShadowPad and two new variants of a backdoor known as SparrowDoor. The activity has been attributed to a threat actor tracked as FamousSparrow.\nMorphing Meerkat Uses DNS MX and DoH to Distribute Spam\n— A newly discovered phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) operation called\nMorphing Meerkat\nhas been leveraging the Domain Name System (DNS) mail exchange (MX) records to determine the victim's email service provider and dynamically serve fake login pages that impersonate about 114 brands. The platform also makes use of the DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) protocol to evade detection when firing a DNS query to Google or Cloudflare to find the MX records of the victim's email domain. The credentials captured on the spoofed pages are then exfiltrated via Telegram or AJAX requests to external servers. Morphing Meerkat is known to have been active since at least 2020. It features a centralized SMTP infrastructure to distribute thousands of spam emails, with 50% of the traced emails originating from internet services provided by iomart and HostPapa.\n‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs\nAttackers love software vulnerabilities—they're easy doors into your systems. Every week brings fresh flaws, and waiting too long to patch can turn a minor oversight into a major breach. Below are this week's critical vulnerabilities you need to know about. Take a look, update your software promptly, and keep attackers locked out.\nThis week's list includes —\nCVE-2025-2783\n,\nCVE-2025-2476\n(Google Chrome),\nCVE-2025-2857\n(Mozilla Firefox, Tor Browser),\nCVE-2025-1974\n(Kubernetes NGINX Ingress Controller),\nCVE-2025-26512\n(NetApp SnapCenter),\nCVE-2025-22230\n(VMware Tools for Windows),\nCVE-2025-2825\n(CrushFTP),\nCVE-2025-20229\n(Splunk),\nCVE-2025-30232\n(Exim),\nCVE-2025-1716, CVE-2025-1889, CVE-2025-1944, CVE-2025-1945\n(picklescan), and\nCVE-2025-2294\n(Kubio AI Page Builder plugin).\n📰 Around the Cyber World\n23andMe Files for Bankruptcy\n— Genetic testing business 23andMe\nfiled\nfor Chapter 11 bankruptcy, amplifying concerns that the DNA records and personal information of its 15 million customers could soon be up for sale. \"Any buyer will be required to comply with applicable law with respect to the treatment of customer data,\" the company\nsaid\nin an FAQ. The development has\nprompted\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta to issue a privacy consumer alert, detailing the steps users can take to delete their genetic data and destroy their samples. The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office\nsaid\nit's \"monitoring the situation closely.\" While 23andMe notes that genetic data is anonymized and stored separately from personally identifiable information, its\nprivacy policy\nstates the company will retain users' genetic information, date of birth, and sex as required for compliance with applicable legal obligations. In October 2023, it suffered a major data breach, exposing the genetic information of more than six million people.\nKonni Uses AsyncRAT in New Campaign\n— The North Korea-linked\nKonni\nthreat actor has been observed using Windows shortcut (LNK) files that masquerade as PDF files to trigger a multi-stage infection sequence that involves using legitimate cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive to host intermediate payloads that pave the way for the download and deployment of AsyncRAT. The hacking group gets its name from the use of an eponymous RAT called\nKonni RAT\n, which offers data exfiltration, command execution, and persistence capabilities. \"The final execution of AsyncRAT has been changed to operate by receiving C&C server information as an execution argument,\" Enki\nsaid\n. \"This is more flexible than the previous method of hard-coding C&C server information into malicious code, and anyone can take advantage of malicious code by building a separate server.\"\nFBI Warns of Fake File Converters Used to Push Malware\n— Malware peddlers are targeting users who are searching for free file converter services and tools that give them access to the victims' machines. \"These converters and downloading tools will do the task advertised, but the resulting file can contain hidden malware giving criminals access to the victim's computer,\" the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nsaid\n. The tools can also scrape the submitted files for any sensitive information, including credentials and financial details.\nNew SvcStealer Information Stealer Emerges in the Wild\n— A new information stealer called\nSvcStealer\n, written in Microsoft Visual C++, has been detected in the wild spreading via phishing campaigns. This malware harvests sensitive data such as system metadata, files matching certain extensions, running processes, installed software, and user credentials, as well as information from cryptocurrency wallets, messaging applications, and web browsers.\nMeta Begins AI Rollout in Europe But With Limitations\n— Meta has\nannounced\nthat its AI-powered virtual assistant, Meta AI, is finally launching across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger in the European Union and United Kingdom over the coming weeks. \"It's taken longer than we would have liked to get our AI technology into the hands of people in Europe as we continue to navigate its complex regulatory system,\" the company said. The European launch follows\nregulatory and privacy pushback\nabout tapping user data to train AI models. Meta's approach to seeking user consent has come under scrutiny by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), the company's lead data protection regulator in the bloc, forcing the company to halt processing local users' information to train AI models. \"The model powering these Meta AI features wasn't trained on first-party data from users in the E.U.,\" Meta\ntold\nTechCrunch.\nINDOHAXSEC Linked to DDoS and Ransomware Attacks\n— An Indonesian-based hacktivist collective dubbed\nINDOHAXSEC\nhas been linked to a string of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and ransomware attacks against numerous entities and governmental bodies located in Australia, India, Israel, and Malaysia using a mix of custom and publicly available tools. The group, which maintains GitHub, Telegram, and social media accounts, emerged in October 2024. It has since announced partnerships with other hacktivist groups like\nNoName057(16)\n. The ransomware attacks have been found to use a locker called ExorLock, which has been assessed to be written by an earlier iteration of the group when they were active under the name AnonBlackFlag.\nOrion Framework Paves the Way for Privacy-Preserving AI Models\n— A group of academic researchers from New York University has detailed\nOrion\n, a framework that brings support for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to deep learning, thereby allowing AI models to practically and efficiently operate directly on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first.\nOrion\n\"converts deep learning models written in PyTorch into efficient FHE programs,\" the team said. \"The framework also streamlines encryption-related processes, making it easier to manage accumulated noise and execute deep learning computations efficiently.\"\nU.S. Court Upholds Conviction of Joseph Sullivan\n— The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nunanimously upheld\nthe conviction of former Uber Chief Security Officer Joseph Sullivan, who was previously\nheld liable\nfor failing to disclose a 2016 breach of customer and driver records to regulators and attempting to cover up the incident. The court said the verdict \"underscores the importance of transparency even in failure situations — especially when such failures are the subject of federal investigation.\"\nRussia Arrests 3 People Tied Mamont Malware\n— Russian authorities have arrested three individuals suspected of developing an Android malware known as Mamont. The suspects, whose names were not disclosed, were apprehended from the Saratov region, The Record\nreported\n. Earlier this January, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia\nrevealed\nthat the malware was being propagated in the form of APK files via Telegram with the ultimate aim of stealing sensitive personal and financial information from victims' devices. Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said it also\ndiscovered\nthreat actors using novel social engineering tactics to distribute the banking trojan targeting Android devices in the country.\n2 Serbian Journalists Targeted by NSO Group's Pegasus\n— Two investigative journalists in Serbia, who work for the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), were targeted with\nPegasus\n, a commercial spyware developed by NSO Group. The two journalists received last month suspicious messages on the Viber messaging app from an unknown Serbian number linked to Telekom Srbija, the state-telecommunications operator, Amnesty International\nsaid\n. The messages contained a link that, if clicked, would have led to the deployment of the information-gathering tool via a decoy site. Both the journalists did not click on the link. The development marks the third time Pegasus has been used against civil society in Serbia in two years. Serbian authorities have also recently used Cellebrite software to secretly unlock civilians' phones so they could install another brand of homegrown spyware codenamed\nNoviSpy\n.\nIOCONTROL Found Listed for Sale\n— The Iran-linked malware called\nIOCONTROL\n, which is explicitly designed to target industrial environments, has been listed for sale on Telegram and BreachForums, per\nFlashpoint\n. The malware is attributed to a hacking group called Cyber Av3ngers. Also called\nOrpaCrab\n, the sophisticated Linux-based backdoor is capable of surveillance, lateral movement, data exfiltration, system manipulation, and remote control.\nU.K. Issues Warning About Sadistic Online Harm Groups\n— The U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) has warned of a \"deeply concerning\" trend of online networks called\nThe Com\nthat have resorted to inflicting harm and committing various kinds of criminal acts. \"These online forums or communities [...] see offenders collaborate or compete to cause harm across a broad spectrum of criminality – both on and offline – including cyber, fraud, extremism, serious violence, and child sexual abuse,\" the NCA\nsaid\n. Part of this cybercrime ecosystem is the infamous Scattered Spider group, which is known for its advanced social engineering techniques to conduct extortion and ransomware attacks. Last month, Richard Ehiemere, 21, an East London member of the network, was convicted on charges of fraud and making indecent images of children. Part of a group called CVLT, the accused and other members are said to target girls on social media platforms such as Discord and persuade them to send intimate photos of themselves. \"Members threatened to 'dox' their victims, which involves revealing real-world identities and publishing other personal information online, in order to coerce them into complying with their demands,\" the NCA\nsaid\n. \"Girls were forced to join group calls, where they would be instructed to carry out sexual acts and acts of self-harm for their audience. In severe cases, vulnerable victims were encouraged to kill themselves on camera.\" A month prior to that, 19-year-old Cameron Finnigan was\njailed\nfor encouraging suicide, possession of indecent images of children, and two counts of criminal damage.\nUnknown Threat Actor Registers Over 10k Domains for Smishing Scams\n— Over 10,000 domains bearing the\nsame domain pattern\nhave been registered for conducting various kinds of SMS phishing scams. \"The root domain names all begin with the string: com-,\" Palo Alto Networks Unit 42\nsaid\n. \"Since the root domain begins with \"com-\" next to a subdomain, the full domain might trick potential victims into doing a casual inspection.\" The campaigns are designed to trick users into revealing their personal information, including credit or debit card and account information.\nExploiting Car Infotainment System to Plant Spyware\n— NCC Group researchers Alex Plaskett and McCaulay Hudson have\ndemonstrated\na trio of zero-day exploits (CVE-2024-23928, CVE-2024-23929, and CVE-2024-23930) that could be weaponized to break into Pioneer DMH-WT7600NEX, gain shell access, and install malicious software on the in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system. This could then be used to exfiltrate data from the infotainment system to track an individual's location, contacts, and call history. Previously, the duo\nrevealed\nmultiple vulnerabilities in Phoenix Contact CHARX SEC-3100, an electric vehicle (EV) charger controller, that could facilitate privilege escalation and remote code execution (CVE-2024-6788, CVE-2024-25994, CVE-2024-25995, and CVE-2024-25999).\n🎥 Expert Webinar\nIs ASPM the future of AppSec—or just another trend?\nJoin Amir Kaushansky from Palo Alto Networks to find out.

See how it brings all your AppSec tools into one place, so you can spot real risks faster, automate policies, and reduce the need for last-minute fixes. If you want to simplify security and stay ahead of threats, this session is for you. Save your seat now.\nAI Is Fueling Attacks—Learn How to Shut Them Down\n— AI isn't the future threat—it's today's biggest challenge. From deepfake phishing to AI-powered reconnaissance, attackers are moving faster than legacy defenses can keep up. In this session, Zscaler's Diana Shtil shares practical ways to use Zero Trust to defend against AI-driven threats—before they reach your perimeter.\nAI Tools Are Bypassing Your Controls—Here's How to Find and Stop Them\n— You can't protect what you can't see. Shadow AI tools are quietly spreading across SaaS environments—often unnoticed until it's too late. Join Reco's Dvir Sasson for a real-world look at hidden AI usage, stealthy attack paths, and how to get visibility before threats become incidents.\n🔧 Cybersecurity Tools\nNetBird\n— NetBird makes it easy to build secure private networks without complex setups. It connects your devices using WireGuard, with encrypted tunnels and no need to open ports or configure firewalls. Use it at home or work, in the cloud, or self-hosted. Manage access from one place with easy-to-use controls. Fast to install, simple to scale, and works anywhere.\nDalfox\n— It is a fast, flexible open-source tool built for modern XSS testing. Designed with automation at its core, it streamlines everything from parameter analysis to vulnerability verification—making it a favorite for security researchers and bug bounty hunters. With support for multiple scanning modes, advanced discovery techniques, and customizable payloads, Dalfox offers deep insights into reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities—all while providing detailed, developer-friendly output.\n🔒 Tip of the Week\nDisable Browser Autofill for Sensitive Fields\n— Autofill might save time, but it can silently leak your data. Attackers can craft hidden form fields on malicious websites that your browser unknowingly fills with your email, phone number, or even credit card info—without you ever clicking a thing. It's a quiet but real threat, especially in phishing attacks.\nTo stay safer, disable autofill for personal and sensitive fields in your browser settings. In Chrome, go to Settings → Autofill, and turn off Passwords, Payment methods, and Addresses. In Firefox, head to Settings → Privacy & Security, and uncheck all Forms and Autofill options. For Edge, go to Profiles → Personal Info & Payment Info, and switch off both. On Safari, navigate to Preferences → AutoFill and deselect every category.\nFor even more control, use a password manager like Bitwarden or KeePassXC—they only autofill when you explicitly approve it. Convenience is great, but not at the cost of silent data leaks.\nConclusion\nWe often place trust in tools, platforms, and routines—until they become the very weapons used against us.\nThis week's stories are a reminder that threat actors don't break the rules—they bend the conveniences we rely on. It's not just about patching systems; it's about questioning assumptions.\nFound this article interesting?  Follow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

These attacks can result in unauthorized data access and further exploitation.\nTo defend against SSRF:\nRegularly scan and fix vulnerabilities in applications.\nEnable AWS\nIMDSv2\n, which provides an additional security layer against SSRF attacks. AWS provides this safeguard, but configuration is the customer's responsibility.\nAccess Control Weaknesses\nAWS Identify and Access Management (IAM) allows customers to manage who can access what resources - but it's only as strong as its implementation. Customers are responsible for ensuring users and systems only have access to the resources they truly need.\nCommon missteps include:\nOverly permissive roles and access\nMissing security controls\nAccidentally public S3 buckets\nData Exposures\nAWS customers are responsible for the security of the data they store in the cloud - and for how their applications access that data.\nFor example, if your application connects to an AWS Relational Database Service (RDS), the customer must ensure that the application doesn't expose sensitive data to attackers. A simple vulnerability like an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is all it would take for an attacker with a user account to access data belonging to all other users.\nPatch Management\nIt almost goes without saying, but AWS does not patch servers! Customers who deploy EC2 instances are fully responsible for keeping the operating system (OS) and software up to date.\nTake Redis deployed on Ubuntu 24.04 as an example - the customer is responsible for patching vulnerabilities in both the software (Redis) and the OS (Ubuntu). AWS only manages underlying hardware vulnerabilities, like firmware issues.\nAWS services like Lambda reduce some patching responsibilities, but you're still responsible for using supported runtimes and keeping things up to date.\nFirewalls and Attack Surface\nAWS gives customers control over their attack surface, but isn't responsible for what they choose to expose.\nFor instance, if a GitLab server is deployed on AWS, the customer is responsible for layering it behind a VPN, using a firewall, or placing it inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) while ensuring their team has a secure way to access it. Otherwise, a zero-day vulnerability could leave your data compromised, and AWS won't be at fault.\nThe Key Takeaway\nThese examples make one thing clear: cloud security doesn't come out of the box. While AWS secures the underlying infrastructure, everything built on top of it is the customer's responsibility. Overlooking that fact can expose an organization to serious risk - but with the right tools, staying secure is entirely within reach.\nLevel Up Your Cloud Security With Intruder\nIntruder helps you stay ahead of all these vulnerabilities and more, by combining agentless\ncloud security scanning\n, vulnerability scanning, and attack surface management in one powerful, easy-to-use platform.\nWhy it's a game changer:\nFind what others miss:\nIntruder combines external vulnerability scanning with information from AWS accounts to find risks that other solutions might miss.\nNo false alarms:\nCSPM tools can overhype severity. Intruder prioritizes real risks so you can focus on what truly matters.\nCrystal clear fixes:\nIssues are explained in plain English with step-by-step remediation guidance.\nContinuous protection:\nStay ahead with continuous monitoring and alerts when new risks emerge.\nPredictable pricing:\nUnlike other cloud security tools that can rack up unpredictable costs, there's no surprise charges with Intruder.\nGet set up in minutes and receive instant insights into your cloud security –\nstart your 14 day free trial today\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

It's operational since at least 2013.\nThe latest campaign is characterized by the distribution of Windows shortcut (LNK) files compressed inside ZIP archives, disguising them as Microsoft Office documents related to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war to trick recipients into opening them. It's believed these archives are sent via phishing emails.\nThe links to Gamaredon stem from the use of two machines that were used in creating the malicious shortcut files and which were\npreviously utilized\nby the threat actor for similar purposes.\nThe LNK files come fitted with PowerShell code that's responsible for downloading and executing the next-stage payload cmdlet Get-Command, as well as fetching a decoy file that's displayed to the victim to keep up the ruse.\nThe second stage is another ZIP archive, which contains a malicious DLL to be executed via a technique referred to as DLL side-loading. The DLL is a loader that decrypts and runs the final Remcos payload from encrypted files present within the archive.\nThe disclosure comes as Silent Push detailed a phishing campaign that uses website lures to gather information against Russian individuals sympathetic to Ukraine. The activity is believed to be the work of either Russian Intelligence Services or a threat actor aligned with Russia.\nThe campaign consists of four major phishing clusters, impersonating the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Russian Volunteer Corps, Legion Liberty, and Hochuzhit \"I Want to Live,\" a\nhotline\nfor receiving appeals from Russian service members in Ukraine to surrender themselves to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\nThe phishing pages have been found to be hosted on a bulletproof hosting provider, Nybula LLC, with the threat actors relying on Google Forms and email responses to gather personal information, including their political views, bad habits, and physical fitness, from victims.\n\"All the campaigns [...] observed have had similar traits and shared a common objective: collecting personal information from site-visiting victims,\" Silent Push\nsaid\n. \"These phishing honeypots are likely the work of either Russian Intelligence Services or a threat actor aligned to Russian interests.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The page then prompts the user to \"fix\" the issue by running PowerShell commands that download and execute the malware on the system.\nSekoia says that Lazarus impersonates numerous well-known companies in the latest campaign, including Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, Circle, Securitize, BlockFi, Tether, Robinhood, and Bybit, from which the North Korean threat actors recently\nstole a record $1.5 billion\n.\n\"By collecting data (i.e. JSON objects) included in all the fake interview websites we identified, we were able to determine which companies were unknowingly used as a lure for these fake interviews,\"\nexplains Sekoia\n.\n\"Our analysis is based on 184 different invitations retrieved from fake interview websites.

        "Content": "“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” -U.S. Constitution, First Amendment.\nImage: Shutterstock, zimmytws.\nIn an address to Congress this month, President Trump claimed he had “brought free speech back to America.” But barely two months into his second term, the president has waged an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment rights of journalists, students, universities, government workers, lawyers and judges.\nThis story explores a slew of recent actions by the Trump administration that threaten to undermine all five pillars of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedoms concerning speech, religion, the media, the right to assembly, and the right to petition the government and seek redress for wrongs.\nThe right to petition allows citizens to communicate with the government, whether to complain, request action, or share viewpoints — without fear of reprisal. But that right is being assaulted by this administration on multiple levels. For starters, many GOP lawmakers are now heeding their leadership’s advice to stay away from local town hall meetings and avoid the wrath of constituents affected by the administration’s many federal budget and workforce cuts.\nAnother example: President Trump recently fired most of the people involved in processing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for government agencies. FOIA is an indispensable tool used by journalists and the public to request government records, and to hold leaders accountable.\nThe biggest story by far this week was the bombshell from The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who recounted how he was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat with National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and 16 other Trump administration officials discussing plans for an upcoming attack on Yemen.\nOne overlooked aspect of Goldberg’s incredible account is that by planning and coordinating the attack on Signal — which features messages that can auto-delete after a short time — administration officials were evidently seeking a way to avoid creating a lasting (and potentially FOIA-able) record of their deliberations.\n“Intentional or not, use of Signal in this context was an act of erasure—because without Jeffrey Goldberg being accidentally added to the list, the general public would never have any record of these communications or any way to know they even occurred,” Tony Bradley wrote this week at Forbes.\nPetitioning the government, particularly when it ignores your requests, often requires challenging federal agencies in court. But that becomes far more difficult if the most competent law firms start to shy away from cases that may involve crossing the president and his administration.\nOn March 22, the president issued a memorandum that directs heads of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to “seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States,” or in matters that come before federal agencies.\nThe POTUS recently issued several executive orders railing against specific law firms with attorneys who worked legal cases against him. On Friday, the president announced that the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meager & Flom had agreed to provide $100 million in pro bono work on issues that he supports.\nTrump issued another order naming the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, which ultimately agreed to pledge $40 million in pro bono legal services to the president’s causes.\nOther Trump executive orders targeted law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, both of which have attorneys that worked with special counsel Robert Mueller on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But this week, two federal judges in separate rulings froze parts of those orders.\n“There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, and that is qualified as a constitutional harm,” wrote Judge Richard Leon, who ruled against the executive order targeting WilmerHale.\nPresident Trump recently took the extraordinary step of calling for the impeachment of federal judges who rule against the administration. Trump called U.S. District Judge James Boasberg a “Radical Left Lunatic” and urged he be removed from office for blocking deportation of Venezuelan alleged gang members under a rarely invoked wartime legal authority.\nIn a rare public rebuke to a sitting president, U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts issued a statement on March 18 pointing out that “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”\nThe U.S. Constitution provides that judges can be removed from office only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. The Constitution also states that judges’ salaries cannot be reduced while they are in office.\nUndeterred, House Speaker Mike Johnson this week suggested the administration could still use the power of its purse to keep courts in line, and even floated the idea of wholesale eliminating federal courts.\n“We do have authority over the federal courts as you know,” Johnson said. “We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts, and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act, so stay tuned for that.”\nPresident Trump has taken a number of actions to discourage lawful demonstrations at universities and colleges across the country, threatening to cut federal funding for any college that supports protests he deems “illegal.”\nA Trump executive order in January outlined a broad federal crackdown on what he called “the explosion of antisemitism” on U.S. college campuses. This administration has asserted that foreign students who are lawfully in the United States on visas do not enjoy the same free speech or due process rights as citizens.\nReuters reports that the acting civil rights director at the Department of Education (DOE) on March 10 sent letters to 60 educational institutions warning they could lose federal funding if they don’t do more to combat anti-semitism. On March 20, Trump issued an order calling for the closure of the DOE.\nMeanwhile, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been detaining and trying to deport pro-Palestinian students who are legally in the United States. The administration is targeting students and academics who spoke out against Israel’s attacks on Gaza, or who were active in campus protests against U.S. support for the attacks. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Thursday that at least 300 foreign students have seen their visas revoked under President Trump, a far higher number than was previously known.\nIn his first term, Trump threatened to use the national guard or the U.S. military to deal with protesters, and in campaigning for re-election he promised to revisit the idea.\n“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” Trump told Fox News in October 2024. “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big — and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”\nThis term, Trump acted swiftly to remove the top judicial advocates in the armed forces who would almost certainly push back on any request by the president to use U.S. soldiers in an effort to quell public protests, or to arrest and detain immigrants. In late February, the president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired the top legal officers for the military services — those responsible for ensuring the Uniform Code of Military Justice is followed by commanders.\nMilitary.com warns that the purge “sets an alarming precedent for a crucial job in the military, as President Donald Trump has mused about using the military in unorthodox and potentially illegal ways.” Hegseth told reporters the removals were necessary because he didn’t want them to pose any “roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.”\nPresident Trump has sued a number of U.S. news outlets, including 60 Minutes, CNN, The Washington Post, The New York Times and other smaller media organizations for unflattering coverage.\nIn a $10 billion lawsuit against 60 Minutes and its parent Paramount, Trump claims they selectively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris prior to the 2024 election. The TV news show last month published transcripts of the interview at the heart of the dispute, but Paramount is reportedly considering a settlement to avoid potentially damaging its chances of winning the administration’s approval for a pending multibillion-dollar merger.\nThe president sued The Des Moines Register and its parent company, Gannett, for publishing a poll showing Trump trailing Harris in the 2024 presidential election in Iowa (a state that went for Trump). The POTUS also is suing the Pulitzer Prize board over 2018 awards given to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their coverage of purported Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nWhether or not any of the president’s lawsuits against news organizations have merit or succeed is almost beside the point. The strategy behind suing the media is to make reporters and newsrooms think twice about criticizing or challenging the president and his administration. The president also knows some media outlets will find it more expedient to settle.\nTrump also sued ABC News and George Stephanopoulos for stating that the president had been found liable for “rape” in a civil case [Trump was found liable of sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll]. ABC parent Disney settled that claim by agreeing to donate $15 million to the Trump Presidential Library.\nFollowing the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Facebook blocked President Trump’s account. Trump sued Meta, and after the president’s victory in 2024 Meta settled and agreed to pay Trump $25 million: $22 million would go to his presidential library, and the rest to legal fees. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also announced Facebook and Instagram would get rid of fact-checkers and rely instead on reader-submitted “community notes” to debunk disinformation on the social media platform.\nBrendan Carr, the president’s pick to run the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has pledged to “dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.” But on January 22, 2025, the FCC reopened complaints against ABC, CBS and NBC over their coverage of the 2024 election. The previous FCC chair had dismissed the complaints as attacks on the First Amendment and an attempt to weaponize the agency for political purposes.\nAccording to Reuters, the complaints call for an investigation into how ABC News moderated the pre-election TV debate between Trump and Biden, and appearances of then-Vice President Harris on 60 Minutes and on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.”\nSince then, the FCC has opened investigations into NPR and PBS, alleging that they are breaking sponsorship rules. The Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), a think tank based in Washington, D.C., noted that the FCC is also investigating KCBS in San Francisco for reporting on the location of federal immigration authorities.\n“Even if these investigations are ultimately closed without action, the mere fact of opening them – and the implicit threat to the news stations’ license to operate – can have the effect of deterring the press from news coverage that the Administration dislikes,” the CDT’s Kate Ruane observed.\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to “open up” libel laws, with the goal of making it easier to sue media organizations for unfavorable coverage. But this week, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge brought by Trump donor and Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn to overturn the landmark 1964 decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, which insulates the press from libel suits over good-faith criticism of public figures.\nThe president also has insisted on picking which reporters and news outlets should be allowed to cover White House events and participate in the press pool that trails the president. He barred the Associated Press from the White House and Air Force One over their refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico by another name.\nAnd the Defense Department has ordered a number of top media outlets to vacate their spots at the Pentagon, including CNN, The Hill, The Washington Post, The New York Times, NBC News, Politico and National Public Radio.\n“Incoming media outlets include the New York Post, Breitbart, the Washington Examiner, the Free Press, the Daily Caller, Newsmax, the Huffington Post and One America News Network, most of whom are seen as conservative or favoring Republican President Donald Trump,” Reuters reported.\nShortly after Trump took office again in January 2025, the administration began circulating lists of hundreds of words that government staff and agencies shall not use in their reports and communications.\nThe Brookings Institution notes that in moving to comply with this anti-speech directive, federal agencies have purged countless taxpayer-funded data sets from a swathe of government websites, including data on crime, sexual orientation, gender, education, climate, and global development.\nThe New York Times reports that in the past two months, hundreds of terabytes of digital resources analyzing data have been taken off government websites.\n“While in many cases the underlying data still exists, the tools that make it possible for the public and researchers to use that data have been removed,” The Times wrote.\nOn Jan. 27, Trump issued a memo (PDF) that paused all federally funded programs pending a review of those programs for alignment with the administration’s priorities. Among those was ensuring that no funding goes toward advancing “Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies.”\nAccording to the CDT, this order is a blatant attempt to force government grantees to cease engaging in speech that the current administration dislikes, including speech about the benefits of diversity, climate change, and LGBTQ issues.\n“The First Amendment does not permit the government to discriminate against grantees because it does not like some of the viewpoints they espouse,” the CDT’s Ruane wrote. “Indeed, those groups that are challenging the constitutionality of the order argued as much in their complaint, and have won an injunction blocking its implementation.”\nOn January 20, the same day Trump issued an executive order on free speech, the president also issued an executive order titled “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,” which froze funding for programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Among those were programs designed to empower civil society and human rights groups, journalists and others responding to digital repression and Internet shutdowns.\nAccording to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), this includes many freedom technologies that use cryptography, fight censorship, protect freedom of speech, privacy and anonymity for millions of people around the world.\n“While the State Department has issued some limited waivers, so far those waivers do not seem to cover the open source internet freedom technologies,” the EFF wrote about the USAID disruptions. “As a result, many of these projects have to stop or severely curtail their work, lay off talented workers, and stop or slow further development.”\nOn March 14, the president signed another executive order that effectively gutted the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees or funds media outlets including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America (VOA). The USAGM also oversees Radio Free Asia, which supporters say has been one of the most reliable tools used by the government to combat Chinese propaganda.\nBut this week, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth, a Reagan appointee, temporarily blocked USAGM’s closure by the administration.\n“RFE/RL has, for decades, operated as one of the organizations that Congress has statutorily designated to carry out this policy,” Lamberth wrote in a 10-page opinion. “The leadership of USAGM cannot, with one sentence of reasoning offering virtually no explanation, force RFE/RL to shut down — even if the President has told them to do so.”\nThe Trump administration rescinded a decades-old policy that instructed officers not to take immigration enforcement actions in or near “sensitive” or “protected” places, such as churches, schools, and hospitals.\nThat directive was immediately challenged in a case brought by a group of Quakers, Baptists and Sikhs, who argued the policy reversal was keeping people from attending services for fear of being arrested on civil immigration violations. On Feb. 24, a federal judge agreed and blocked ICE agents from entering churches or targeting migrants nearby.\nThe president’s executive order allegedly addressing antisemitism came with a fact sheet that described college campuses as “infested” with “terrorists” and “jihadists.” Multiple faith groups expressed alarm over the order, saying it attempts to weaponize antisemitism and promote “dehumanizing anti-immigrant policies.”\nThe president also announced the creation of a “Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias,” to be led by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Never mind that Christianity is easily the largest faith in America and that Christians are well-represented in Congress.\nThe Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, a Baptist minister and head of the progressive Interfaith Alliance, issued a statement accusing Trump of hypocrisy in claiming to champion religion by creating the task force.\n“From allowing immigration raids in churches, to targeting faith-based charities, to suppressing religious diversity, the Trump Administration’s aggressive government overreach is infringing on religious freedom in a way we haven’t seen for generations,” Raushenbush said.\nA statement from Americans United for Separation of Church and State said the task force could lead to religious persecution of those with other faiths.\n“Rather than protecting religious beliefs, this task force will misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination, and the subversion of our civil rights laws,” said Rachel Laser, the group’s president and CEO.\nWhere is President Trump going with all these blatant attacks on the First Amendment? The president has made no secret of his affection for autocratic leaders and “strongmen” around the world, and he is particularly enamored with Hungary’s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has visited Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort twice in the past year.\nA March 15 essay in The Atlantic by Hungarian investigative journalist András Pethő recounts how Orbán rose to power by consolidating control over the courts, and by building his own media universe while simultaneously placing a stranglehold on the independent press.\n“As I watch from afar what’s happening to the free press in the United States during the first weeks of Trump’s second presidency — the verbal bullying, the legal harassment, the buckling by media owners in the face of threats — it all looks very familiar,” Pethő wrote. “The MAGA authorities have learned Orbán’s lessons well.”\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Sunday 30th of March 2025 09:22 PM \r\n         \nIT Security like the 1t Amendment is built upon  TRUST\nWhen the layers of your security foundation are comprised/eroded\nit is when the threats to the ”information” takeover and\nsubvert the ”meaning of the information”.\nTHANKS FOR BEING THE CIVIC ORIENTED STANDARD WE NEED!\nF*** the REST!\nGood article.\nPeople can show support for the rule of law by attending the nationwide rally Sat April 5th at a location in their city or state.\n#Resist.\nBeing Canadian and aside from the futile Trump’s threaths of annexing my country, I think that you guys have a big problem on your hands.  I have sympathy for reasonable people of the USA and I wish them good luck.  Because the real group of terrorists in your country are now at the helm of your nation and you really need to do something to get these wackos out of there before you end up having no more control on your situation.  If you leave Trump and his goons in place too long, it will be the end of the USA like we’ve known it until now.\nI’m glad you wrote this, Brian. This is well thought out and shows the hypocrisy of this administration and it’s so-called fight to restore free speech. Anyone without working ears and eyes could see that it was all just a rouse.\nI am also sorry to see politics brought into this blog. I will NOT be leaving. Having followed Mr. Krebs’ cybersecurity work from before this blog started, I can say this post was not done lightly. Every point Mr. Krebs brought up is important and is very concerning to me. The politics was brought to this blog by the politicians’ actions against the constitution they have sworn to uphold.

I’m sure this timeless mantra has not only been used, but proven frustratingly true on multiple occasions for everyone reading this column. In today’s data-rich world, it’s also advice that is more broadly applicable in business than ever before. However, in security the equation is much more complex. In many ways it needs to follow an organizational “order of operations,” where certain measurements, wherever they reside in the business, need to occur before subsequent calculations. Failure to do so will result in insufficient or misleading results. While in construction, a mismeasured cut is immediately apparent, a misalignment in security may not present itself for weeks, months or even years – and the evidence may be a catastrophic failure. \n\n\n\nWhen organizations evaluate offensive security testing specifically, many look to immediately jump into penetration tests or engage a Red Team. What they fail to ask is, are you built correctly to not just withstand the individual test, but the tests of time and change. Can you operationalize the results in a way that affects demonstrable, positive and continuous improvement. \n\n\n\nThis column will provide the “mathematical” principles, and even some suggested “units” of assessment, to guide organizations in gauging the readiness and maturity of their security programs to make testing of all types as impactful as possible. \n\n\n\nThe “Calculus” of Maturity \nAs in life, maturity is not an inherent trait. It is earned through experience, and the ability to process, analyze and apply the lessons learned. Organizationally, as you progress in experience and (hopefully) maturity, the tasks become more complex and the lessons come with greater gravity and consequence.  \n\n\n\nWe’ll dive more specifically into what each level comprises, but at the highest level, we see the levels of maturity as such: \n\n\n\n\nFoundational – this includes threat modeling and security reviews; attack surface visibility and management; vulnerability management and application security testing\nAdvanced – at this level includes network, cloud, and application penetration testing\nAdversary Emulation – a demonstrably mature program is then ready for activities including Red Teaming, Purple Teaming and Tabletop Exercises. \n\nSo, when is an organization mature enough to advance to the next level?  To put it simply, the assessment process analyzes the state of a security program from two vantage points – the activities being done, and who is doing them.  \n\n\n\nIn terms of what is being done, the assessment examines the activities being performed at the current level in terms of their coverage, and their cadence. For example, how much visibility does an organization have into the breadth and depth of their attack surface or applications?  Also, how regularly are they revisiting testing results to accommodate for changes in infrastructure, code or threat environment? \n\n\n\nBehind those activities, is an assessment of the people doing the testing, and the processes and technologies in place to support them. Are there adequate resources to cover in-depth and regular testing?  Are there clear and enforceable processes to ensure it’s happening?  Do they have frameworks, systems and technology in place to document and track progress, including external modeling such as the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)? Essentially, the assessment looks at the ability to successfully conduct testing, the ability to manage a repeatable process for benchmarking, and the infrastructure and resources in place to sustain the program and clear measurement/metrics on a continuous basis. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nOf course, progression also comes with the aforementioned consequences. A strong security program will be increasingly complex, which will sometimes require substantial organizational and cultural changes around security practices, and inevitably, a higher cost. So let’s take a quick tour of the actual assessment activities by which maturity is assessed, and against which growth can be mapped.\n\n\n\n“Addition by Addition” \n\n\n\nGoing briefly back to our building analogy, an enduring structure requires a strong foundation. This stage is about understanding what you know, finding out what you don’t, and prioritizing in what order all of it will be addressed.  This process endeavors to identify programmatic deficiencies, and then sets out to either advance existing, or construct new capabilities around threat assessment, and attack surface and vulnerability management.  \n\n\n\nThe first category here is in reviewing Threat Modeling and Architecture security. This includes looking both externally and internally. First, mapping the top threats and threat actors, most likely to find your organization an attractive target. Second, the top “crown jewel” systems they would target for compromise. \n\n\n\nRemaining at the enterprise level, the next step is to establish an internal framework and underlying program that graphs threats and risks, and provides a repeatable mechanism to track and refresh that understanding over time.  This includes graphs of all enterprise systems, and their associated connections and dependencies, as well as attack graphs that represent all the potential paths through your architecture that would lead an attacker to their prize. Finally, the third element is an architectural security review that discerns from the graphs what paths are most possible and probable. Installing a program that guides and tracks three activities will also pay dividends down the line in better informing and increasing the efficacy of adversarial simulations. \n\n\n\nWe all know the devil resides in the details. At this stage we begin understanding the actual vulnerability of individual assets and systems. The first step is a comprehensive inventory of elements that exist across the organization. This includes internal endpoint assets, and external perimeter and cloud systems. As you’d likely expect, the next step is vulnerability scanning of the full asset inventory that was established. By the end of this process, an organization has created a granular understanding of their entire attack surface, ferreted out and addressed the known vulnerabilities, and established that critical foundation for ongoing awareness and protection. On to the next challenge. \n\n\n\n“Divide” and Conquer  \n\n\n\nHaving largely addressed the known, it’s time to address the unknown, or at least of what you are unaware of. This step goes beyond scanning and moves to build out, augment and/or sharpen advanced operational mechanisms for penetration testing of applications, networks and clouds.  Much like an attacker, this follows an outside-in approach. \n\n\n\nThe first surfaces tested are the perimeter of your traditional network, as well as your cloud infrastructure. Then it’s time to dive beneath the surface.  This includes testing internal network assets and systems, and then individual testing of endpoint images, and finally the “crown jewel” targets themselves. \n\n\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, much like an iceberg, this is only the surface, and the rest of the berg lies not only in the applications that comprise your internal ecosystem, but the code that makes up their DNA. As with other steps it begins with a full inventory of the applications, and then a prioritization based on risk of compromise, and then modeling their potential impact to the business. \n\n\n\nNext comes what amounts to a functional deconstruction of applications to test them from multiple vantage points. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) looks for vulnerabilities in application code prior to deployment. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) looks for vulnerabilities and threats to applications already in production. Finally, a Software Composition Analysis examines third-party libraries used in the development of applications. All three of these are core fundamental parts of a well-run Application Security function. As also stated, cadence is one of the main assessment criteria, so all applications should undergo regular review and testing, particularly to understand the impact of application upgrades or changes in environment or infrastructure. We’ve covered a lot of testing, now it’s time to see if you’re ready to graduate.  \n\n\n\nForce “Multiplier” \n\n\n\nMany often joke about the advanced math classes they took and when they’d actually come into play in daily life. Well, this highest stage of maturity can be looked at like Applied Mathematics. An organization at this stage has grown its program to the point of having a posture and discipline that can consume and drive continuous improvement from full adversarial emulation and testing at scale.  In the lower stages you’re solving problems. At this stage you’re building, testing and verifying – resilience.  \n\n\n\nThis stage is about testing your organizational mettle – and the networks, systems, applications, and code you’ve secured – in the face of simulated, but realistic attacks. The Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) of actual attackers are used to find weaknesses, and determine if trained offensive security professionals can reach your crown jewels.  It also tests the improvements you’ve made and your ability to detect and stop an attacker from causing damage, as well as your organizational ability to respond and recover if an attack is successful. \n\n\n\nFrom an offensive and defensive perspective, Red Teams and Purple Teams are used to test technical exposure and response. A Red Team will map a threat intelligence profile to specific assets and environmental dynamics, and test them to determine any assets that are vulnerable to the TTPs within the profile. Purple Teams conduct “live fire” walkthroughs that allow Red Teams and Blue Teams (internal defensive security teams) to openly play out attack situations and determine the extent to which defense can rapidly detect and negate offensive attempts. Finally, from a resilience perspective, Tabletop simulations determine the strength and adaptability of organizational stakeholders (internal and external), and business processes with regards to incident response.  \n\t\t\t\nWhen organizations evaluate offensive security testing specifically, many look to immediately jump into penetration tests or engage a Red Team. What they fail to ask is, are you built correctly to not just withstand the individual test, but the tests of time and change.

Organizationally, as you progress in experience and (hopefully) maturity, the tasks become more complex and the lessons come with greater gravity and consequence.  \n\n\n\nWe’ll dive more specifically into what each level comprises, but at the highest level, we see the levels of maturity as such: \n\n\n\n\nFoundational – this includes threat modeling and security reviews; attack surface visibility and management; vulnerability management and application security testing\nAdvanced – at this level includes network, cloud, and application penetration testing\nAdversary Emulation – a demonstrably mature program is then ready for activities including Red Teaming, Purple Teaming and Tabletop Exercises. \n\nSo, when is an organization mature enough to advance to the next level?  To put it simply, the assessment process analyzes the state of a security program from two vantage points – the activities being done, and who is doing them.  \n\n\n\nIn terms of what is being done, the assessment examines the activities being performed at the current level in terms of their coverage, and their cadence. For example, how much visibility does an organization have into the breadth and depth of their attack surface or applications?  Also, how regularly are they revisiting testing results to accommodate for changes in infrastructure, code or threat environment? \n\n\n\nBehind those activities, is an assessment of the people doing the testing, and the processes and technologies in place to support them. Are there adequate resources to cover in-depth and regular testing?  Are there clear and enforceable processes to ensure it’s happening?  Do they have frameworks, systems and technology in place to document and track progress, including external modeling such as the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)? Essentially, the assessment looks at the ability to successfully conduct testing, the ability to manage a repeatable process for benchmarking, and the infrastructure and resources in place to sustain the program and clear measurement/metrics on a continuous basis. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nOf course, progression also comes with the aforementioned consequences. A strong security program will be increasingly complex, which will sometimes require substantial organizational and cultural changes around security practices, and inevitably, a higher cost. So let’s take a quick tour of the actual assessment activities by which maturity is assessed, and against which growth can be mapped.\n\n\n\n“Addition by Addition” \n\n\n\nGoing briefly back to our building analogy, an enduring structure requires a strong foundation. This stage is about understanding what you know, finding out what you don’t, and prioritizing in what order all of it will be addressed.  This process endeavors to identify programmatic deficiencies, and then sets out to either advance existing, or construct new capabilities around threat assessment, and attack surface and vulnerability management.  \n\n\n\nThe first category here is in reviewing Threat Modeling and Architecture security. This includes looking both externally and internally. First, mapping the top threats and threat actors, most likely to find your organization an attractive target. Second, the top “crown jewel” systems they would target for compromise. \n\n\n\nRemaining at the enterprise level, the next step is to establish an internal framework and underlying program that graphs threats and risks, and provides a repeatable mechanism to track and refresh that understanding over time.  This includes graphs of all enterprise systems, and their associated connections and dependencies, as well as attack graphs that represent all the potential paths through your architecture that would lead an attacker to their prize. Finally, the third element is an architectural security review that discerns from the graphs what paths are most possible and probable. Installing a program that guides and tracks three activities will also pay dividends down the line in better informing and increasing the efficacy of adversarial simulations. \n\n\n\nWe all know the devil resides in the details. At this stage we begin understanding the actual vulnerability of individual assets and systems. The first step is a comprehensive inventory of elements that exist across the organization. This includes internal endpoint assets, and external perimeter and cloud systems. As you’d likely expect, the next step is vulnerability scanning of the full asset inventory that was established. By the end of this process, an organization has created a granular understanding of their entire attack surface, ferreted out and addressed the known vulnerabilities, and established that critical foundation for ongoing awareness and protection. On to the next challenge. \n\n\n\n“Divide” and Conquer  \n\n\n\nHaving largely addressed the known, it’s time to address the unknown, or at least of what you are unaware of. This step goes beyond scanning and moves to build out, augment and/or sharpen advanced operational mechanisms for penetration testing of applications, networks and clouds.  Much like an attacker, this follows an outside-in approach. \n\n\n\nThe first surfaces tested are the perimeter of your traditional network, as well as your cloud infrastructure. Then it’s time to dive beneath the surface.  This includes testing internal network assets and systems, and then individual testing of endpoint images, and finally the “crown jewel” targets themselves. \n\n\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, much like an iceberg, this is only the surface, and the rest of the berg lies not only in the applications that comprise your internal ecosystem, but the code that makes up their DNA. As with other steps it begins with a full inventory of the applications, and then a prioritization based on risk of compromise, and then modeling their potential impact to the business. \n\n\n\nNext comes what amounts to a functional deconstruction of applications to test them from multiple vantage points. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) looks for vulnerabilities in application code prior to deployment. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) looks for vulnerabilities and threats to applications already in production. Finally, a Software Composition Analysis examines third-party libraries used in the development of applications. All three of these are core fundamental parts of a well-run Application Security function. As also stated, cadence is one of the main assessment criteria, so all applications should undergo regular review and testing, particularly to understand the impact of application upgrades or changes in environment or infrastructure. We’ve covered a lot of testing, now it’s time to see if you’re ready to graduate.  \n\n\n\nForce “Multiplier” \n\n\n\nMany often joke about the advanced math classes they took and when they’d actually come into play in daily life. Well, this highest stage of maturity can be looked at like Applied Mathematics. An organization at this stage has grown its program to the point of having a posture and discipline that can consume and drive continuous improvement from full adversarial emulation and testing at scale.  In the lower stages you’re solving problems. At this stage you’re building, testing and verifying – resilience.  \n\n\n\nThis stage is about testing your organizational mettle – and the networks, systems, applications, and code you’ve secured – in the face of simulated, but realistic attacks. The Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) of actual attackers are used to find weaknesses, and determine if trained offensive security professionals can reach your crown jewels.  It also tests the improvements you’ve made and your ability to detect and stop an attacker from causing damage, as well as your organizational ability to respond and recover if an attack is successful. \n\n\n\nFrom an offensive and defensive perspective, Red Teams and Purple Teams are used to test technical exposure and response. A Red Team will map a threat intelligence profile to specific assets and environmental dynamics, and test them to determine any assets that are vulnerable to the TTPs within the profile. Purple Teams conduct “live fire” walkthroughs that allow Red Teams and Blue Teams (internal defensive security teams) to openly play out attack situations and determine the extent to which defense can rapidly detect and negate offensive attempts. Finally, from a resilience perspective, Tabletop simulations determine the strength and adaptability of organizational stakeholders (internal and external), and business processes with regards to incident response.  \n\t\t\t\nThe “Calculus” of Maturity \nAs in life, maturity is not an inherent trait.

This step goes beyond scanning and moves to build out, augment and/or sharpen advanced operational mechanisms for penetration testing of applications, networks and clouds.  Much like an attacker, this follows an outside-in approach. \n\n\n\nThe first surfaces tested are the perimeter of your traditional network, as well as your cloud infrastructure. Then it’s time to dive beneath the surface.  This includes testing internal network assets and systems, and then individual testing of endpoint images, and finally the “crown jewel” targets themselves. \n\n\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, much like an iceberg, this is only the surface, and the rest of the berg lies not only in the applications that comprise your internal ecosystem, but the code that makes up their DNA. As with other steps it begins with a full inventory of the applications, and then a prioritization based on risk of compromise, and then modeling their potential impact to the business. \n\n\n\nNext comes what amounts to a functional deconstruction of applications to test them from multiple vantage points. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) looks for vulnerabilities in application code prior to deployment. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) looks for vulnerabilities and threats to applications already in production. Finally, a Software Composition Analysis examines third-party libraries used in the development of applications. All three of these are core fundamental parts of a well-run Application Security function. As also stated, cadence is one of the main assessment criteria, so all applications should undergo regular review and testing, particularly to understand the impact of application upgrades or changes in environment or infrastructure. We’ve covered a lot of testing, now it’s time to see if you’re ready to graduate.  \n\n\n\nForce “Multiplier” \n\n\n\nMany often joke about the advanced math classes they took and when they’d actually come into play in daily life. Well, this highest stage of maturity can be looked at like Applied Mathematics. An organization at this stage has grown its program to the point of having a posture and discipline that can consume and drive continuous improvement from full adversarial emulation and testing at scale.  In the lower stages you’re solving problems. At this stage you’re building, testing and verifying – resilience.  \n\n\n\nThis stage is about testing your organizational mettle – and the networks, systems, applications, and code you’ve secured – in the face of simulated, but realistic attacks. The Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) of actual attackers are used to find weaknesses, and determine if trained offensive security professionals can reach your crown jewels.  It also tests the improvements you’ve made and your ability to detect and stop an attacker from causing damage, as well as your organizational ability to respond and recover if an attack is successful. \n\n\n\nFrom an offensive and defensive perspective, Red Teams and Purple Teams are used to test technical exposure and response. A Red Team will map a threat intelligence profile to specific assets and environmental dynamics, and test them to determine any assets that are vulnerable to the TTPs within the profile. Purple Teams conduct “live fire” walkthroughs that allow Red Teams and Blue Teams (internal defensive security teams) to openly play out attack situations and determine the extent to which defense can rapidly detect and negate offensive attempts. Finally, from a resilience perspective, Tabletop simulations determine the strength and adaptability of organizational stakeholders (internal and external), and business processes with regards to incident response.  \n\t\t\t\nIn terms of what is being done, the assessment examines the activities being performed at the current level in terms of their coverage, and their cadence. For example, how much visibility does an organization have into the breadth and depth of their attack surface or applications?  Also, how regularly are they revisiting testing results to accommodate for changes in infrastructure, code or threat environment? \n\n\n\nBehind those activities, is an assessment of the people doing the testing, and the processes and technologies in place to support them. Are there adequate resources to cover in-depth and regular testing?  Are there clear and enforceable processes to ensure it’s happening?  Do they have frameworks, systems and technology in place to document and track progress, including external modeling such as the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)? Essentially, the assessment looks at the ability to successfully conduct testing, the ability to manage a repeatable process for benchmarking, and the infrastructure and resources in place to sustain the program and clear measurement/metrics on a continuous basis. Advertisement.

A strong security program will be increasingly complex, which will sometimes require substantial organizational and cultural changes around security practices, and inevitably, a higher cost. So let’s take a quick tour of the actual assessment activities by which maturity is assessed, and against which growth can be mapped.\n\n\n\n“Addition by Addition” \n\n\n\nGoing briefly back to our building analogy, an enduring structure requires a strong foundation. This stage is about understanding what you know, finding out what you don’t, and prioritizing in what order all of it will be addressed.  This process endeavors to identify programmatic deficiencies, and then sets out to either advance existing, or construct new capabilities around threat assessment, and attack surface and vulnerability management.  \n\n\n\nThe first category here is in reviewing Threat Modeling and Architecture security. This includes looking both externally and internally. First, mapping the top threats and threat actors, most likely to find your organization an attractive target. Second, the top “crown jewel” systems they would target for compromise. \n\n\n\nRemaining at the enterprise level, the next step is to establish an internal framework and underlying program that graphs threats and risks, and provides a repeatable mechanism to track and refresh that understanding over time.  This includes graphs of all enterprise systems, and their associated connections and dependencies, as well as attack graphs that represent all the potential paths through your architecture that would lead an attacker to their prize. Finally, the third element is an architectural security review that discerns from the graphs what paths are most possible and probable. Installing a program that guides and tracks three activities will also pay dividends down the line in better informing and increasing the efficacy of adversarial simulations. \n\n\n\nWe all know the devil resides in the details. At this stage we begin understanding the actual vulnerability of individual assets and systems. The first step is a comprehensive inventory of elements that exist across the organization.

On to the next challenge. \n\n\n\n“Divide” and Conquer  \n\n\n\nHaving largely addressed the known, it’s time to address the unknown, or at least of what you are unaware of. This step goes beyond scanning and moves to build out, augment and/or sharpen advanced operational mechanisms for penetration testing of applications, networks and clouds.  Much like an attacker, this follows an outside-in approach. \n\n\n\nThe first surfaces tested are the perimeter of your traditional network, as well as your cloud infrastructure. Then it’s time to dive beneath the surface.  This includes testing internal network assets and systems, and then individual testing of endpoint images, and finally the “crown jewel” targets themselves. \n\n\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, much like an iceberg, this is only the surface, and the rest of the berg lies not only in the applications that comprise your internal ecosystem, but the code that makes up their DNA. As with other steps it begins with a full inventory of the applications, and then a prioritization based on risk of compromise, and then modeling their potential impact to the business. \n\n\n\nNext comes what amounts to a functional deconstruction of applications to test them from multiple vantage points. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) looks for vulnerabilities in application code prior to deployment. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) looks for vulnerabilities and threats to applications already in production. Finally, a Software Composition Analysis examines third-party libraries used in the development of applications. All three of these are core fundamental parts of a well-run Application Security function. As also stated, cadence is one of the main assessment criteria, so all applications should undergo regular review and testing, particularly to understand the impact of application upgrades or changes in environment or infrastructure. We’ve covered a lot of testing, now it’s time to see if you’re ready to graduate.  \n\n\n\nForce “Multiplier” \n\n\n\nMany often joke about the advanced math classes they took and when they’d actually come into play in daily life. Well, this highest stage of maturity can be looked at like Applied Mathematics. An organization at this stage has grown its program to the point of having a posture and discipline that can consume and drive continuous improvement from full adversarial emulation and testing at scale.  In the lower stages you’re solving problems. At this stage you’re building, testing and verifying – resilience.  \n\n\n\nThis stage is about testing your organizational mettle – and the networks, systems, applications, and code you’ve secured – in the face of simulated, but realistic attacks. The Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) of actual attackers are used to find weaknesses, and determine if trained offensive security professionals can reach your crown jewels.  It also tests the improvements you’ve made and your ability to detect and stop an attacker from causing damage, as well as your organizational ability to respond and recover if an attack is successful. \n\n\n\nFrom an offensive and defensive perspective, Red Teams and Purple Teams are used to test technical exposure and response. A Red Team will map a threat intelligence profile to specific assets and environmental dynamics, and test them to determine any assets that are vulnerable to the TTPs within the profile. Purple Teams conduct “live fire” walkthroughs that allow Red Teams and Blue Teams (internal defensive security teams) to openly play out attack situations and determine the extent to which defense can rapidly detect and negate offensive attempts. Finally, from a resilience perspective, Tabletop simulations determine the strength and adaptability of organizational stakeholders (internal and external), and business processes with regards to incident response.  \n\t\t\t\nRemaining at the enterprise level, the next step is to establish an internal framework and underlying program that graphs threats and risks, and provides a repeatable mechanism to track and refresh that understanding over time.  This includes graphs of all enterprise systems, and their associated connections and dependencies, as well as attack graphs that represent all the potential paths through your architecture that would lead an attacker to their prize. Finally, the third element is an architectural security review that discerns from the graphs what paths are most possible and probable. Installing a program that guides and tracks three activities will also pay dividends down the line in better informing and increasing the efficacy of adversarial simulations. \n\n\n\nWe all know the devil resides in the details. At this stage we begin understanding the actual vulnerability of individual assets and systems. The first step is a comprehensive inventory of elements that exist across the organization. This includes internal endpoint assets, and external perimeter and cloud systems. As you’d likely expect, the next step is vulnerability scanning of the full asset inventory that was established. By the end of this process, an organization has created a granular understanding of their entire attack surface, ferreted out and addressed the known vulnerabilities, and established that critical foundation for ongoing awareness and protection. On to the next challenge. \n\n\n\n“Divide” and Conquer  \n\n\n\nHaving largely addressed the known, it’s time to address the unknown, or at least of what you are unaware of. This step goes beyond scanning and moves to build out, augment and/or sharpen advanced operational mechanisms for penetration testing of applications, networks and clouds.  Much like an attacker, this follows an outside-in approach. \n\n\n\nThe first surfaces tested are the perimeter of your traditional network, as well as your cloud infrastructure. Then it’s time to dive beneath the surface.  This includes testing internal network assets and systems, and then individual testing of endpoint images, and finally the “crown jewel” targets themselves. \n\n\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, much like an iceberg, this is only the surface, and the rest of the berg lies not only in the applications that comprise your internal ecosystem, but the code that makes up their DNA. As with other steps it begins with a full inventory of the applications, and then a prioritization based on risk of compromise, and then modeling their potential impact to the business. \n\n\n\nNext comes what amounts to a functional deconstruction of applications to test them from multiple vantage points.

It has been observed targeting users in Spain and Turkey.\n\n\n\nThe malware is installed using a proprietary dropper that can bypass restrictions implemented in Android 13 and newer platform iterations, and requests Accessibility Services permissions, which allow it to take over the infected device.\n\n\n\nAfter obtaining the necessary permissions, the threat connects to its command-and-control (C&C) server, which provides it with instructions regarding the targeted applications and overlays to be used.\n\n\n\nCrocodilus runs continuously in the background, monitoring the launched applications and displaying overlays to steal the victim’s credentials.\n\n\n\nThe malware performs keylogging by monitoring all accessibility events to capture elements displayed on the screen, which allows it to log all text modifications made by the user.

The next day, Mandiant revealed that it had been exploited in the wild since December 2024, by a China-linked espionage group tracked as UNC5221.\n\n\n\nThe threat actor, known to have targeted other Ivanti VPN vulnerabilities before, exploited CVE-2025-0282 to deploy malware from the Spawn family, which includes the SpawnAnt installer, the SpawnMole tunneler, and the SpawnSnail SSH backdoor.\n\n\n\nOn February 20, JPCERT/CC revealed that multiple threat actors had already been targeting the vulnerability, confirming that some of the attacks featured a new member of the Spawn malware family, tracked as SpawnChimera.\n\n\n\nAccording to JPCERT/CC, SpawnChimera contains updated iterations of SpawnAnt, SpawnMole, and SpawnSnail. The malware can be injected into various processes, running in each of them, and contains a function to patch CVE-2025-0282.\n\n\n\nOn March 28, CISA released its own analysis of malware collected from an instance of CVE-2025-0282 exploitation, which it tracks as Resurge, and which was dropped on the compromised Ivanti Connect Secure device as a Linux share library named ‘libdsupgrade.so’.\n\n\n\n“The file contains capabilities of a rootkit, dropper, backdoor, bootkit, proxy, and tunneler. The file shares similar functionality to SpawnChimera malware; however, this file contains a series of commands that modify files, manipulates integrity checks, and creates a web shell that is copied to the running Ivanti boot disk,” CISA notes.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nSimilar to SpawnChimera, Resurge checks whether it is loaded by a program called ‘web’ or ‘dsmdm’, to hook accept and strncpy functions and create a proxy for tunneling, or to create a thread for a secure shell via SSH.\n\n\n\nIt also contains a series of commands to set up a web shell for remote command execution, tamper with the coreboot RAM disk, and run sed commands to modify two Python files. The malware sets up persistence by inserting itself into the ‘ld.so.preload’ file.\n\n\n\nCISA also notes that the analyzed sample contained a variant of the SpawnSloth malware, which can modify Ivanti device logs. It was dropped on the compromised device as ‘liblogblock.so’.\n\n\n\nA third malicious file used in the attack, named ‘dsmain’, is a 64-bit Linux executable containing an open source shell script and applets from BusyBox, which were used to extract a kernel image and to download and execute payloads, respectively.\n\n\n\nRelated: Many Ivanti VPNs Still Unpatched as UK Domain Registry Emerges as Victim of Exploitation\nRelated: CISA Warns of Ivanti EPM Vulnerability Exploitation\nRelated: PoC Exploit Published for Critical Ivanti EPM Vulnerabilities\nRelated: FBI/CISA Share Details on Ivanti Exploits Chains: What Network Defenders Need to Know\n\nThe issue, tracked as CVE-2025-0282 (CVSS score of 9.0), is described as a stack-based buffer overflow enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely, without authentication.\n\n\n\nIvanti announced patches for the bug on January 8, warning of its active exploitation.
