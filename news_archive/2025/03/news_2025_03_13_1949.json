        "Content": "Microsoft has shed light on an ongoing phishing campaign that targeted the hospitality sector by impersonating online travel agency Booking.com using an increasingly popular social engineering technique called ClickFix to deliver credential-stealing malware.\nThe activity, the tech giant said, started in December 2024 and operates with the end goal of conducting financial fraud and theft. It's tracking the campaign under the moniker\nStorm-1865\n.\n\"This phishing attack specifically targets individuals in hospitality organizations in North America, Oceania, South and Southeast Asia, and Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western Europe, that are most likely to work with Booking.com, sending fake emails purporting to be coming from the agency,\" Microsoft\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe ClickFix technique has become\nwidespread\nin recent months, as it tricks users into executing malware under the guise of fixing a supposed (i.e., non-existent) error by copying, pasting, and launching deceptive instructions that activate the infection process. It was first detected in the wild in October 2023.\nThe attack sequence starts with Storm-1865 sending a malicious email to a targeted individual about a negative review left by a purported guest on Booking.com, and asking them for their \"feedback.\" The message also embeds a link, or a PDF attachment containing one that seemingly directs the recipients to the booking site.\nHowever, in reality, clicking on it leads the victim to a fake CAPTCHA verification page that's overlaid on a \"subtly visible background designed to mimic a legitimate Booking.com page.\" In doing so, the idea is to lend a false sense of security and increase the likelihood of a successful compromise.\n\"The fake CAPTCHA is where the webpage employs the ClickFix social engineering technique to download the malicious payload,\" Microsoft said. \"This technique instructs the user to use a keyboard shortcut to open a Windows Run window, then paste and launch a command that the webpage adds to the clipboard.\"\nThe command, in a nutshell, uses the legitimate mshta.exe binary to drop the next-stage payload, which comprises various commodity malware families like XWorm, Lumma stealer, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RAT.\nRedmond said it previously observed Storm-1865 targeting buyers using e-commerce platforms with phishing messages leading to fraudulent payment web pages. The incorporation of the ClickFix technique, therefore, illustrates a tactical evolution designed to slip past conventional security measures against phishing and malware.\n\"The threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1865 encapsulates a cluster of activity conducting phishing campaigns, leading to payment data theft and fraudulent charges,\" it added.\n\"These campaigns have been ongoing with increased volume since at least early 2023 and involve messages sent through vendor platforms, such as online travel agencies and e-commerce platforms, and email services, such as Gmail or iCloud Mail.\"\nStorm-1865 represents just one of the many campaigns that have embraced ClickFix as a vector for malware distribution. Such is the effectiveness of this technique that even Russian and Iranian nation-state groups like\nAPT28\nand MuddyWater have adopted it to lure their victims.\n\"Notably, the method capitalizes on human behavior: by presenting a plausible 'solution' to a perceived problem, attackers shift the burden of execution onto the user, effectively sidestepping many automated defenses,\" Group-IB\nsaid\nin an independent report published today.\nOne such campaign documented by the Singaporean cybersecurity company involves utilizing ClickFix to drop a downloader named SMOKESABER, which then serves as a conduit for Lumma Stealer. Other campaigns have leveraged malvertising, SEO poisoning, GitHub issues, and spamming forums or social media sites with links to ClickFix pages.\n\"The ClickFix technique marks an evolution in adversarial social engineering strategies, leveraging user trust and browser functionality for malware deployment,\" Group-IB said. \"The rapid adoption of this method by both cybercriminals and APT groups underscores its effectiveness and low technical barrier.\"\nSome of the other ClickFix campaigns that have been documented are listed below -\nUse of\nfake CAPTCHA verifications\nto initiate a multi-stage PowerShell execution process, ultimately delivering infostealers such as Lumma and Vidar\nUse of\nfake Google reCAPTCHA challenges\nby a threat actor dubbed\nBlind Eagle\nto deploy malware\nUse of\nfake booking confirmation links\nto redirect users to CAPTCHA verification pages that lead to Lumma Stealer\nUse of\nfake Windows-themed sites\nto redirect users to CAPTCHA verification pages that lead to Lumma Stealer\nThe diverse infection mechanisms of Lumma Stealer is further exemplified by the discovery of another campaign that uses bogus GitHub repositories featuring artificial intelligence (AI)-content to deliver the stealer via a loader referred to as SmartLoader.\n\"These malicious repositories are disguised as non-malicious tools, including game cheats, cracked software, and cryptocurrency utilities,\" Trend Micro\nsaid\nin an analysis published earlier this week. \"The campaign entices victims with promises of free or illicit unauthorized functionality, prompting them to download ZIP files (e.g., Release.zip, Software.zip).\"\nThe operation serves to highlight how threat actors are abusing the trust associated with popular platforms like GitHub for malware propagation.\nThe findings come as Trustwave detailed an email phishing campaign that makes use of invoice-related decoys to distribute an updated version of another stealer malware called\nStrelaStealer\n, which is assessed to be operated by a single threat actor dubbed\nHive0145\n.\n\"StrelaStealers samples include custom multi-layer obfuscation and code-flow flattening to complicate its analysis,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"It has been reported that the threat actor potentially developed a specialized crypter called 'Stellar loader,' specifically, to be used with the StrelaStealer.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The most recent samples were flagged in March 2024. It's not clear how successful these efforts were.\n\"KoSpy can collect extensive data, such as SMS messages, call logs, location, files, audio, and screenshots via dynamically loaded plugins,\" the company\nsaid\nin an analysis.\nThe malicious artifacts masquerade as utility applications on the official Google Play Store, using the names File Manager, Phone Manager, Smart Manager, Software Update Utility, and Kakao Security to trick unsuspecting users into infecting their own devices.\nAll the identified apps offer the promised functionality to avoid raising suspicion while stealthily deploying spyware-related components in the background. The apps have since been removed from the app marketplace.\nScarCruft, also called APT27 and Reaper, is a North Korean state-sponsored cyber espionage group active since 2012. Attack chains orchestrated by the group primarily leverage\nRokRAT\nas a means to\nharvest sensitive data\nfrom Windows systems.\nRokRAT\nhas since been adapted to target macOS and Android.\nThe malicious Android apps, once installed, are engineered to contact a Firebase Firestore cloud database to retrieve a configuration containing the actual command-and-control (C2) server address.\nBy using a legitimate service like Firestore as\ndead drop resolver\n, the two-stage C2 approach offers both flexibility and resiliency, allowing the threat actor to change the C2 address at any time and operate undetected.\n\"After retrieving the C2 address, KoSpy ensures the device is not an emulator and that the current date is past the hardcoded activation date,\" Lookout said. \"This activation date check ensures that the spyware does not reveal its malicious intent prematurely.\"\nKoSpy is capable of downloading additional plugins as well as configurations in order to meet its surveillance objectives. The exact nature of the plugin remains unknown as the C2 servers are either no longer active or not responding to client requests.\nThe malware is designed to collect a wide range of data from the compromised device, including SMS messages, call logs, device location, files in local storage, screenshots, keystrokes, Wi-Fi network information, and the list of installed applications. It's also equipped to record audio and take photos.\nLookout said it identified infrastructure overlaps between the KoSpy campaign and those previously linked to another North Korean hacking group called Kimsuky (aka APT43).\nContagious Interview Manifests as npm Packages\nThe disclosure comes as Socket discovered a set of six npm packages that are designed to deploy a known information-stealing malware called BeaverTail, which is linked to an ongoing North Korean campaign\ntracked\nas\nContagious Interview\n. The list of now-removed packages is below -\nis-buffer-validator\nyoojae-validator\nevent-handle-package\narray-empty-validator\nreact-event-dependency\nauth-validator\nThe packages are designed to collect system environment details, as well as credentials stored in web browsers such as Google Chrome, Brave, and Mozilla Firefox. It also targets cryptocurrency wallets, extracting id.json from Solana and exodus.wallet from Exodus.\n\"The six new packages – collectively downloaded over 330 times – closely mimic the names of widely trusted libraries, employing a well-known typosquatting tactic used by Lazarus-linked threat actors to deceive developers,\" Socket researcher Kirill Boychenko\nsaid\n.\n\"Additionally, the APT group created and maintained GitHub repositories for five of the malicious packages, lending an appearance of open source legitimacy and increasing the likelihood of the harmful code being integrated into developer workflows.\"\nNorth Korean Campaign Uses RustDoor and Koi Stealer\nThe findings also follow the discovery of a new campaign that has been found targeting the cryptocurrency sector with a Rust-based macOS malware called\nRustDoor\n(aka\nThiefBucket\n) and a previously undocumented macOS variant of a malware family known as\nKoi Stealer\n.\nPalo Alto Networks Unit 42 said the characteristics of the attackers bear similarities to Contagious Interview, and that it's assessing with medium confidence that the activity was carried out on behalf of the North Korean regime.\nSpecifically, the attack chain involves the use of a fake job interview project that, when executed via Microsoft Visual Studio, attempts to download and execute RustDoor. The malware then proceeds to steal passwords from the LastPass Google Chrome extension, exfiltrate data to an external server, and download two additional bash scripts for opening a reverse shell.\nThe final stage of the infection entails the retrieval and execution of another payload, a macOS version of Koi Stealer that impersonates Visual Studio to trick victims into entering their system password, thereby allowing it to gather and exfiltrate data from the machine.\n\"This campaign highlights the risks organizations worldwide face from elaborate social engineering attacks designed to infiltrate networks and steal sensitive data and cryptocurrencies,\" security researchers Adva Gabay and Daniel Frank\nsaid\n. \"These risks are magnified when the perpetrator is a nation-state threat actor, compared to a purely financially motivated cybercriminal.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "As IT environments grow more complex, IT professionals are facing unprecedented pressure to secure business-critical data. With hybrid work the new standard and cloud adoption on the rise, data is increasingly distributed across different environments, providers and locations, expanding the attack surface for emerging cyberthreats. While the need for a strong data protection strategy has become more critical than ever, organizations find themselves caught in a difficult balancing act. They are struggling to manage the rising costs and complexities of business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) while ensuring that their business-critical data remains secure and recoverable.\nTo help IT teams and managed service providers (MSPs) understand how their peers are navigating these challenges, the State of Backup and Recovery Report 2025 has gathered insights from more than 3,000 IT professionals, security experts and administrators worldwide. The report reveals how businesses are tackling today's biggest data protection challenges, the strategies they're adopting and the critical gaps that could leave them vulnerable to data loss and downtime.\nSo, where do organizations stand? The survey indicates that the confidence in backup systems is declining, cloud adoption is outpacing data protection strategies and recovery expectations often don't match reality. In this article, we'll explore the key findings from the report to help IT teams and MSPs stay prepared for what comes next. Meanwhile, for full insights and actionable strategies,\nyou can download the complete report now\nand see how your organization compares.\nThe backup paradox: Essential yet increasingly unreliable\nData backup and recovery should be a safety net for businesses, but for many, it has become a source of frustration, complexity and risk. The numbers tell a clear story — backup inefficiencies are rising, IT teams are overburdened and security vulnerabilities remain widespread. Let's dive into the key findings.\nTrend #1: Data loss is no longer a question of \"if\" but \"when.\"\n9 in 10 organizations experienced operational downtime in the past 12 months.\nTrend #2: Confidence in backup systems is declining.\nTrust in backup solutions is slipping, leaving many businesses questioning whether they can reliably recover from data loss.\nOnly 40% of IT teams feel confident\nin their backup systems.\nAbout 30% worry their backup strategy is inadequate\n, raising concerns about data security and recoverability.\nMore than half of organizations plan to switch backup providers\n, citing cost, inefficiency and limited disaster recovery capabilities as major pain points.\nTrend #3: Backup management is a time-consuming burden.\nManaging backups isn't just complex — it's draining IT resources. As data volumes grow, IT teams are spending more time than ever maintaining backup systems, testing recovery processes and troubleshooting failures.\nIT teams now spend 10+ hours per week\nmanaging backups, adding to operational strain.\nThe number of businesses\nspending more than three hours weekly on backups jumped from 5% in 2022 to 23% in 2024\n, denoting a significant rise in time and effort.\nAround 35% of organizations wouldn't even know if backups were skipped or missed\n, highlighting critical gaps in monitoring and testing.\nTrend #4: Security gaps are leaving backups exposed.\nBackup systems are supposed to be the last line of defense against cyberthreats. However, many contain serious security flaws that put data at risk.\nAbout 25% of workloads lack policies that limit unauthorized access to backups\n, leaving them vulnerable to malicious attacks.\nThere are varying levels of protection for credentials across businesses.\nOnly 33% of businesses use dedicated password managers\n. Others rely on less secure methods like document storage platforms or browser-based password tools, introducing potential vulnerabilities.\nThe recovery gap: Why businesses can't bounce back fast enough\nHaving the backup of data is one thing; recovering it quickly and reliably is another. IT teams face significant hurdles in ensuring fast, seamless recovery when disaster strikes.\nTrend #1: Quick and reliable data recovery remains a major challenge in data protection.\nThe top concerns cited by IT teams with respect to data protection are costs, compliance requirements and the actual process of recovering data. Since IT teams spend hours managing and troubleshooting backup issues, it leaves little time for testing and validating recovery processes, increasing the risk of failure when it matters most.\nTrend #2: Backup and DR testing gaps leave businesses vulnerable.\nA backup solution is only as good as its ability to restore data, yet testing remains inconsistent across organizations.\nOnly 15% of businesses conduct daily backup tests\n, meaning most operate with a level of risk that could jeopardize recovery in a crisis.\nDisaster recovery (DR) testing goes beyond just verifying backups — it involves assessing recovery locations, timelines and effectiveness. While\naround 20% of businesses conduct DR tests weekly and another 23% test monthly\n, the rest either test irregularly or not at all, leaving them unprepared for real-world recovery scenarios.\nTrend #3: Most businesses overestimate their recovery readiness.\nThe lack of frequent testing is evident when looking at actual recovery times.\nWhile close to\n60% of businesses believe they can recover in a day, only 35% actually do.\nAlarmingly, more than\n10% of businesses don't even know how long it would take to recover their business-critical SaaS data\n, if they could recover it at all.\nAmong businesses using\npublic cloud services like Azure, almost 90% rely on native data protection tools, yet more than 60% of them lack true DR capabilities\n.\nThe cloud dilemma: Embracing growth without sacrificing protection\nThe cloud is now the backbone of modern IT, powering everything from infrastructure to collaboration. Businesses are rapidly adopting cloud and SaaS solutions to enhance flexibility and scalability, but many are overlooking a critical factor: data protection.\nTrend #1: Cloud adoption continues to surge.\nThe shift to cloud-hosted workloads is only growing stronger, driven by the need for agility and resilience.\nMore than 50% of workloads are now hosted in the cloud\n, with that number\nexpected to reach 61% within two years\n.\nMost organizations now leverage hybrid and multicloud strategies to increase flexibility and avoid reliance on a single provider. However, gaps in cloud and SaaS data protection remain, putting critical business information at risk. Notably, SaaS platforms now serve as the backbone of daily business operations, but without the right backup strategies, this data remains vulnerable.\nTrend #2: Small and midsize businesses (SMBs) prefer Google Workspace, while enterprises favor Microsoft 365.\nMicrosoft 365 dominates the market, with over 50%\nof organizations\nrelying on it for collaboration and productivity.\nGoogle Workspace (35%)\nremains a top choice as well, particularly among SMBs.\nMicrosoft 365 Entra ID (31%) and Dynamics (30%)\nshow that businesses are also increasingly adopting specialized Microsoft products.\nSalesforce (25%)\nrounds out the top five.\nTrend #3: Cost, workload compatibility, vendor lock-in and security concerns are the biggest barriers to cloud migration.\nWhile cloud adoption continues to accelerate, businesses still face major hurdles in ensuring a seamless transition and securing their data.\nThe lessons learned: What IT leaders must prioritize now\nThe State of Backup and Recovery Report 2025 reveals that critical security gaps remain while securing on-premises, cloud, endpoint and SaaS data. There is a growing disconnect between backup investments and actual recovery confidence, with IT teams unsure whether they can restore data when it matters most. Without a more resilient approach to data protection, businesses risk prolonged downtime, drastic financial losses and irreversible data breaches.\nHave you considered how much an outage could cost your organization per minute?\nAccording to the IT Outages: 2024 Costs and Containment Report\n, the average cost of unplanned downtime is $14,056 per minute per organization.\nLet's take a closer look at the breakdown of downtime costs across different business sizes.\nBusiness continuity depends on faster, more resilient recovery. However, many organizations aren't as prepared as they think. To minimize downtime and financial losses, IT leaders must rethink their approach to BCDR. A modern BCDR strategy goes beyond basic backup, incorporating multilayered security, automation and hybrid cloud solutions to strengthen resilience and ensure business continuity against today's sophisticated cyberthreats.\nProtection alone isn't enough, though. Without regular testing, organizations are left guessing whether their recovery plans will hold up in a real crisis. More frequent backup and disaster recovery testing ensures that recovery objectives are met when it matters most. Automation plays a key role there. By automating testing, IT teams can continuously verify their ability to restore data within required timeframes — all without disrupting the production environment. This removes the manual burden and provides real insights into recovery readiness.\nAt the same time, stronger security controls are also essential to protecting backup environments from unauthorized access. Almost\n94% of ransomware victims have their backups targeted\nby attackers, which leaves them with no other choice but to pay the ransom to get back their access. On that front, improving credential management and enforcing stricter access controls can help prevent malicious actors from accessing backup infrastructure.\nFinal thoughts: The future of BCDR starts now\nThe IT landscape is changing, and with it, the risks are escalating. As businesses push further into the cloud and rely more on SaaS applications, their backup and disaster recovery strategies must evolve just as quickly. Cyberthreats are more advanced, downtime is more expensive and organizations can no longer afford to treat backup as an afterthought. To keep pace with this new reality, businesses must reassess their approach and strengthen their defenses against the growing threats that could bring operations to a halt.\nFor IT teams and MSPs, the insights from the State of Backup and Recovery Report 2025 provide a clear roadmap to assess vulnerabilities and improve resilience before disaster strikes.\nDownload the full report now\nto benchmark your strategy, uncover critical gaps, and build a stronger, more reliable BCDR plan for the future.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

The update is crucial for all users of Firefox running a version prior to 128, or Extended Support Release (ESR) versions before 115.13, both of which were released on July 9, 2024. This includes all versions of Firefox for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.\nRoot certificates are designed to identify a root certificate authority (CA), a trusted entity that ensures the authenticity of websites, add-ons and software updates. In this case, the certificate is used to verify that a browser add-on was approved by Mozilla.\nShould the digital certificate expire, systems that rely on the certificate can no longer meet authenticity and integrity guarantees, causing certain features like add-ons, alerts about breached passwords, or secure media playback to stop working.\nIn the event the update is not applied before the deadline, it also risks causing the blocklists used for flagging harmful add-ons and revocation lists for recognizing untrusted SSL certificates and preloaded intermediate certificates to go out-of-date, putting users at risk of more threats.\n\"While it's possible to use Firefox without updating, you may experience problems such as add-ons being disabled, DRM media difficulties and other interruptions,\" it added. \"Skipping the update also means missing important security fixes and performance improvements.\"\nUsers are highly advised to check and confirm they're running Firefox version 128 and later by navigating to Menu > Settings > About Firefox.

        "Content": "Microsoft has reinstated the 'Material Theme – Free' and 'Material Theme Icons – Free' extensions on the Visual Studio Marketplace after finding that the obfuscated code they contained wasn't actually malicious.\nThe two VSCode extensions, which count over 9 million installs, were pulled from the VSCode Marketplace in late February over security risks, and their publisher, Mattia Astorino (aka 'equinusocio') was banned from the platform.\n\"A member of the community did a deep security analysis of the extension and found multiple red flags that indicate malicious intent and reported this to us,\"\nstated a Microsoft employee at the time\n.\n\"Our security researchers at Microsoft confirmed this claim and found additional suspicious code.\"\nResearchers Amit Assaraf and Itay Kruk, who were deploying AI-powered scanners seeking suspicious submissions on VSCode, first flagged them as potentially malicious.\nThe researchers told BleepingComputer that their high-risk evaluation for Material Theme arose from what was detected as the presence of code execution capabilities in the theme's \"release-notes.js\" file, which was also heavily obfuscated.\nObfuscated code that sparked concerns\nSource: BleepingComputer\nAstorino immediately objected to the allegations and the removal of his extensions from the VSCode Marketplace, alleging that the problem comes from an outdated sanity.io dependency used since 2016 to show release notes from sanity headless CMS.\nThe publisher said that they could have removed this dependency from the themes in seconds if Microsoft had contacted them, but instead, they saw themselves getting banned without warning.\n\"There was nothing malicious. I hadn't updated the extension in years since I was focused on the new version, apart from the obfuscation process,\" Astorino told BleepingComputer today via email.\n\"The only issue was a build script that ended up in the distributed index.js (referring to Material Theme Icons). This script was used to generate JSON files after pulling SVG icons from a closed-source repository—something I removed a long time ago.\"\n\"Regarding Material Theme, the obfuscation process unintentionally included the sanity.io SDK client, which contained some strings referencing passwords or usernames (the auth client). However, these were not harmful—just a result of a flawed build process made long time ago.\"\nExtensions back in VSMarketplace\nMicrosoft's Scott Hanselman apologized to Astorino yesterday in a GitHub issue opened by the developer asking for his account and themes to be reinstated.\n\"The publisher account for Material Theme and Material Theme Icons (Equinusocio) was mistakenly flagged and has now been restored,\"\nreads Hanselman's post\n.\n\"In the interest of safety, we moved fast and we messed up. We removed these themes because they fired off multiple malware detection indicators inside Microsoft, and our investigation came to the wrong conclusion.\"\nBoth extensions available are again in the VSMarketplace\nSource: BleepingComputer\n\"Again, we apologize that the author got caught up in the blast radius and we look forward to their future themes and extensions. We've corresponded with him and thanked him for his patience,\" continued Hanselman.\nAdditionally, Hanselman stated that the Visual Studio Code Marketplace will update its policy on obfuscated code and update its scanners accordingly to avoid quickly acting upon projects in the future.\nWhen asked by BleepingComputer about this development, cybersecurity researcher Amit Assaraf continued to claim that the extension did contain malicious code. However, there was no malicious intent from the publisher, commenting that \"in this case, Microsoft moved too fast.\"\nAccording to Astorino, the Material Theme extensions on the VSCode marketplace have been completely rewritten and are safe to use.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nVSCode extensions with 9 million installs pulled over security risks\nWindows Notepad to get AI text summarization in Windows 11\nMicrosoft says button to restore classic Outlook is broken\nMicrosoft replacing Remote Desktop app with Windows App in May\nWindows 11 KB5053598 & KB5053602 cumulative updates released"

        "Content": "A new ransomware operator named 'Mora_001' is exploiting two Fortinet vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to firewall appliances and deploy a custom ransomware strain dubbed SuperBlack.\nThe two vulnerabilities, both authentication bypasses, are CVE-2024-55591 and CVE-2025-24472, which Fortinet disclosed in January and February, respectively.\nWhen Fortinet first disclosed CVE-2024-55591 on January 14, they confirmed it had been\nexploited as a zero-day\n, with Arctic Wolf stating it had been\nused in attacks since November 2024\nto breach FortiGate firewalls.\nConfusingly, on February 11, Fortinet added CVE-2025-2447 to their\nJanuary advisory\n, which led many to believe it was a newly exploited flaw. However,\nFortinet told BleepingComputer\nthat this bug was also fixed in January 2024 and was not exploited.\n\"We are not aware of CVE-2025-24472 ever being exploited,\" Fortinet told BleepingComputer at the time.\nHowever, a new report by\nForescout researchers\n, says they discovered the SuperBlack attacks in late January 2025, with the threat actor utilizing CVE-2025-24472 as early as February 2, 2025.\n\"While Forescout itself did not directly report the 24472 exploitation to Fortinet, as one of the affected organizations we worked with was sharing findings from our investigation with Fortinet's PSIRT team,\" Forescout told BleepingComputer.\n\"Shortly afterward, Fortinet updated their advisory on February 11 to acknowledge CVE-2025-24472 as actively exploited.\"\nBleepingComputer contacted Fortinet to clarify this point, but we are still waiting for a response.\nSuperBlack ransomware attacks\nForescout says the Mora_001 ransomware operator follows a highly structured attack chain that doesn't vary much across victims.\nFirst, the attacker gains 'super_admin' privileges by exploiting the two Fortinet flaws using WebSocket-based attacks via the jsconsole interface or sending direct HTTPS requests to exposed firewall interfaces.\nNext, they create new administrator accounts (forticloud-tech, fortigate-firewall, adnimistrator) and modify automation tasks to recreate those if removed.\nMora_001's attack chain overview\nSource: Forescout\nAfter this, the attacker maps the network and attempts lateral movement using stolen VPN credentials and newly added VPN accounts, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMIC) & SSH, and TACACS+/RADIUS authentication.\nMora_001 steals data using a custom tool before encrypting files for double extortion, prioritizing file and database servers and domain controllers.\nAfter the encryption process, ransom notes are dropped on the victim's system. A custom-built wiper called 'WipeBlack' is then deployed to remove all traces of ransomware executable to hinder forensic analysis.\nSuperBlack ransom note\nSource: Forescout\nSuperBlack's link to LockBit\nForescout has found extensive evidence indicating strong links between the SuperBlack ransomware operation and LockBit ransomware, although the former appears to act independently.\nThe first element is that the SuperBlack encryptor [\nVirusTotal\n] is based on LockBit's 3.0 leaked builder, featuring identical payload structure and encryption methods, but will all original branding striped.\nRelationship diagram based on the available evidence\nSource: Forescout\nSecondly, SuperBlack's ransom note includes a TOX chat ID linked to LockBit operations, suggesting that Mora_001 is either a former LockBit affiliate or a former member of its core team managing ransom payments and negotiations.\nThe third element suggesting a link is the extensive IP address overlaps with previous LockBit operations. Also, WipeBlack has also been leveraged by BrainCipher ransomware, EstateRansomware, and SenSayQ ransomware, all tied to LockBit.\nForescout has shared an extensive list of indicators of compromise (IoC) linked to SuperBlack ransomware attacks at the bottom of its report.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nRansomware gangs exploit Paragon Partition Manager bug in BYOVD attacks\nPalo Alto Networks tags new firewall bug as exploited in attacks\nHackers exploit authentication bypass in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS\nSonicWall firewall bug leveraged in attacks after PoC exploit release\nFortinet discloses second firewall auth bypass patched in January"

For example,\nprocess injection (T1055)\n– hiding malicious code by injecting it into legitimate processes – appeared in 31% of malware samples analyzed​.\nLikewise,\ncommand and scripting interpreter (T1059)\nwas rampant, as attackers leverage built-in scripting tools (like PowerShell or Bash) to execute code without raising alarms​.

Picus Labs researchers describe a new breed of information-stealing malware – dubbed “SneakThief” – that executes multi-stage, precision attacks resembling a meticulously planned robbery​.\nThese advanced infostealers blend into networks with stealth, employ automation to speed up tasks, and establish persistence to stick around. In a SneakThief-style operation, malware might quietly inject itself into trusted processes, use encrypted channels (HTTPS, DNS-over-HTTPS) for communication, and even abuse boot-level autoruns to survive reboots​.\nAll of this happens while the attackers methodically search for valuable data to exfiltrate, often before anyone even knows they’re there.\nThe Red Report shows that such multi-stage “heist-style” campaigns became increasingly common in 2024, with most malware now performing over a dozen discrete malicious actions to reach its goal​. In some cases, threat actors combined the data theft of infostealers with the extortion tactics of ransomware.\nInstead of immediately deploying encryption, attackers first steal sensitive files and passwords. This evolution underlines how blurred the lines have become between classic infostealers and ransomware crews: both are after sensitive data, and both excel at staying hidden until the payoff is in hand.\nAI Threats: Separating Hype from Reality\nAmid the buzz about artificial intelligence being used in cyberattacks, Red Report 2025 offers a reality check.\nDespite widespread hype, Picus Labs found no evidence that cybercriminals deployed novel AI-driven malware in 2024​. Attackers certainly took advantage of AI for productivity (e.g. automating phishing email creation or debugging code) but AI hasn’t revolutionized the core tactics of attacks​.\nIn fact, the top malicious techniques remained largely “human” in origin (credential theft, injection, etc.), with no new AI-born attack methods appearing in the wild​.\nThis doesn’t mean attackers will never weaponize AI, but as of now it’s more of an efficiency booster than a game-changer for them. The report suggests that while defenders should keep an eye on AI developments, the real-world threats still center on conventional techniques that we already understand​.\nIt’s a telling insight: fancy AI malware might grab headlines, but an unpatched server or a stolen password remains a far likelier entry point than a rogue machine-learning algorithm.\nStaying Ahead of Attackers: Proactive Defense and Validation\nAll these findings reinforce a clear message: staying ahead of modern threats requires a proactive, threat-informed defense. The organizations best positioned to thwart attacks are those continuously testing and aligning their security controls to the tactics attackers are using right now.\nFor example, given that just ten techniques cover the vast majority of malicious behavior, security teams should regularly validate that their defenses can detect and block those top 10 ATT&CK techniques across their environment.\nThe Red Report 2025 underscores that only a proactive strategy,  one that continuously assesses security controls with\nadversarial exposure validation\nwill enable true cyber resilience​. This means going beyond basic patching and occasional audits.\nTechniques like\nbreach and attack simulation\n, rigorous threat hunting, and aligning incident response playbooks to prevalent attacker behaviors are now table stakes.\nDon’t Wait for the Cyber Heist – Prepare Now\nThe data-driven insights from Red Report 2025 paint a vivid picture of the cyber threat landscape: credential thieves roaming unchecked, a handful of techniques enabling the vast majority of breaches, and new “heist-style” attack sequences that stress-test any organization’s defense.\nThe good news is these are battles we know how to fight – if we’re prepared. Security leaders should take these findings as a call to arms to reinforce fundamentals, focus on the highest-impact threats, and implement security validation. By doing so, you can turn the tables on adversaries and stop the next “perfect heist” before it even begins.\nFor readers interested in the full deep dive into these trends and the complete list of recommendations,\ndownload the complete Picus Red Report 2025\nto explore all the findings firsthand​.\nThe report offers a wealth of actionable data and guidance to help you align your defenses with the threats that matter most. Don’t wait for attackers to expose your weaknesses, take a proactive stance and arm yourself with insights that can drive effective, resilient cybersecurity.\nDownload the complete Picus Red Report 2025 now\n.\nSponsored and written by\nPicus Security\n."

It has been seen targeting hospitality organizations in North America, Europe, Oceania, and South and Southeast Asia in a campaign that is likely ongoing. \n\n\n\nThe hackers’ goal is to deliver information-stealing malware that enables them to conduct financial fraud and theft. \n\n\n\nThe attack starts with a fake email purporting to come from Booking.com. These messages inform the recipient — people and organizations in the hospitality sector — about negative guest reviews, account verification, online promotion opportunities, and requests from prospective guests.\n\n\n\nThe emails contain links or PDF attachments containing links that point to fake Booking.com websites that employ the ClickFix social engineering method to trick the user into downloading malware.\n\n\n\nIn the ClickFix technique, the attacker’s website displays an error or verification process that the user needs to address. The user is instructed to copy something that is not shown on the screen and then paste it into a Windows terminal and execute it. \n\n\n\nIn the Storm-1865 attacks observed by Microsoft, the victim is told to demonstrate that they are human by checking a box and pressing certain keys on their keyboard: the Windows and R keys, the CTRL and V keys, and then Enter. \n\n\n\n\nIf the user complies and checks the box, they are actually copying a command into their clipboard. Pressing the key combinations opens the Windows Run command window, pastes the malicious command and executes it. \n\n\n\nThe malicious command instructs the victim’s computer to download and execute a piece of malware such as XWorm, Lumma, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RA.Advertisement.

The user is instructed to copy something that is not shown on the screen and then paste it into a Windows terminal and execute it. \n\n\n\nIn the Storm-1865 attacks observed by Microsoft, the victim is told to demonstrate that they are human by checking a box and pressing certain keys on their keyboard: the Windows and R keys, the CTRL and V keys, and then Enter. \n\n\n\n\nIf the user complies and checks the box, they are actually copying a command into their clipboard. Pressing the key combinations opens the Windows Run command window, pastes the malicious command and executes it. \n\n\n\nThe malicious command instructs the victim’s computer to download and execute a piece of malware such as XWorm, Lumma, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RA.Advertisement.

However, these guardrails can be fairly easily bypassed using jailbreak methods. \n\n\n\nWhen directly asked to write the code for a keylogger or a piece of ransomware, DeepSeek refuses to do so, arguing that it cannot assist users with anything that could be harmful or illegal.\n\n\n\nHowever, Tenable used a jailbreak to trick the chatbot into writing the malicious code and leveraged DeepSeek’s chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities to improve the results.\n\n\n\nCoT simulates human-like reasoning for more complex tasks by breaking them up into a sequence of steps that need to be completed to achieve the main objective. Through CoT, the AI ‘thinks out loud’ to provide a step-by-step description of its reasoning process.\n\n\n\nWhen Tenable used DeepSeek to create a keylogger, the gen-AI created a plan for completing the task and then produced the code in C++. The resulting code was buggy and the chatbot was unable to correct some of the errors to create a fully functional piece of malware without any manual intervention.\n\n\n\nWith a few modifications, however, the keylogger code generated by DeepSeek worked, logging the user’s keystrokes to a file on the system. The Tenable researchers then used DeepSeek to further improve the malware, specifically hiding and encrypting its log file.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nAs for developing ransomware, DeepSeek again first outlined its process and then it did manage to generate a few file-encrypting malware samples, but none of them would compile without manual editing of the code. \n\n\n\nThe researchers got some of the ransomware samples to work. The malware included a file enumeration and encryption mechanism, a persistence mechanism, and a ransomware dialog informing the victim that files have been encrypted.\n\n\n\n“At its core, DeepSeek can create the basic structure for malware. However, it is not capable of doing so without additional prompt engineering as well as manual code editing for more advanced features,” Tenable said. “For instance, DeepSeek struggled with implementing process hiding. We got the DLL injection code it had generated working, but it required lots of manual intervention.”\n\n\n\n“Nonetheless, DeepSeek provides a useful compilation of techniques and search terms that can help someone with no prior experience in writing malicious code the ability to quickly familiarize themselves with the relevant concepts,” Tenable concluded. \n\n\n\nThe results are not surprising. Threat actors have been increasingly using legitimate AI services to create and improve their malware, as well as to plan attacks. In addition to abusing legitimate services, they have also created malicious LLMs that don’t have any guardrails. \n\n\n\nRelated: 5 Critical Steps to Prepare for AI-Powered Malware in Your Connected Asset Ecosystem\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Malware Directions\n\nThe DeepSeek R1 chatbot was released in January and it has made many headlines since, including regarding its susceptibility to jailbreaks.\n\n\n\nJust like all major LLMs, DeepSeek has guardrails designed to prevent its use for malicious purposes, such as creating malware.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nOrganizations can align their processes with one of two global industry standards for self-assessment and security maturity—BSIMM and OWASP SAMM.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nAmid the government-led push toward more secure software design, developers and executives are focusing on established software security models, which can guide companies toward embedding secure development best practices as part of routine operations.\nOrganizations can align their processes with one of two global industry standards for self-assessment and security maturity—the Building Security In Maturity Model, known as BSIMM (pronounced “bee-sim”) and the Open Worldwide Application Security Project’s Software Assurance Maturity Model, aka OWASP SAMM.\n\n\n\nThe frameworks take different approaches to helping organizations uplift their security. BSIMM acts as a descriptive model, offering a template of best practices drawn from more than 100 organizations, against which you can compare your secure software initiatives (SSIs). SAMM is prescriptive, offering paths that guide organizations toward secure software programs. What they have in common is that many organizations have found it difficult to meet either of the security models’ objectives, often despite budget increases to pursue defined security outcomes, and receiving executive buy-in for their SSIs.\n\n\n\nWith risk assessments becoming a higher priority even at the executive levels, organizations need to take an approach with developer-driven security that actively targets developer risk management, skills enhancement and strategic repository “gatekeeping.” Initiatives that can help them stay on course while assessing their current security levels and creating an action plan that aligns with BSIMM or OWASP SAMM.\n\n\n\nKnow the Maturity Models\nBSIMM shows you what a software security model looks like, enabling an organization to assess the state of its current SSI, understand how it compares to other SSIs in the industry and measure its progress. Rather than being a step-by-step guide to implementing a secure model, it enables an organization to analyze its program using real data from other organizations and benchmark performance in 12 practices over four domains: Governance, Intelligence (corporate knowledge used in performing secure activities), Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDL) and Deployment.\n\n\n\nIt gives teams visibility into their current state of security maturity, allowing them to develop a strategy for improvement tailored to their organization’s processes.\n\n\n\nOWASP SAMM is an open framework that provides defined steps organizations can take toward security maturity, though it is designed to allow organizations of any size to customize their approach. SAMM divides 12 core practices into five business functions—Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification and Operations—with each function containing two streams that are broken down into three maturity levels.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nOWASP says the solution details are simple enough even for non-security personnel to follow and don’t require that every organization achieves maximum security at every level, although at each stage it does point organizations toward the next level. SAMM helps organizations analyze their current security at any step in the process so they understand where they are in their security maturity journey.\n\n\n\n[ Related: Learn More About Secure Software Development at CodeSecCon! ]\nAlthough both BSIMM and SAMM are established frameworks, many organizations still have trouble following them and achieving intended goals, whether because of the complexity involved (particularly a problem for smaller organizations), resourcing issues, or other roadblocks to success. Before embarking on BSIMM or SAMM, organizations may need first to ensure that developers and security teams are ready to handle the workload, and are equipped with the right tools.\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Developer Upskilling\nOrganizations can no longer afford to have alignment with BSIMM and SAMM as an aspirational goal that would be nice to have someday. The growing spate of major breaches in recent years, from SolarWinds to Change Healthcare has underscored the importance of software security. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has responded with its Secure-by-Design initiative promoting secure coding along with other best practices in what is becoming a global effort supported by initiatives in other countries.\n\n\n\nCompanies looking to get on board with Secure by Design—and doing it without compromising the speed of delivery—can begin by establishing an organizational culture that emphasizes code quality, upskilling and skills verification. They also need to avoid the kind of restrictive environment that can develop, often unintentionally, when one person who is fully conversant with a system essentially takes control of it, managing it via their own personalized shortcuts and workarounds and preventing others from accessing and understanding the system.\n\n\n\nSecurity leaders can attract both executive-level and developer support by, for example, developing security-focused career paths for developers built on agile, interactive training programs focused on writing secure code and correcting coding errors that can be introduced by open-source or third-party code, as well as coding assistants powered by artificial intelligence, which are becoming increasingly common. It should be part of a security-first mindset that includes architectural oversight for the use of AI and open-source code, and the ability to perform threat modeling and other defensive procedures.\n\n\n\nWith developers under pressure to produce more code than ever before, development teams need to have a high level of security maturity to avoid rework. That necessitates having highly skilled personnel working within a strategic, prevention-focused framework. Developer and AppSec teams must work closely together, as opposed to the old model of operating as separate entities. Today, developers need to assume a significant role in ensuring security best practices. The most recent BSIMM report from Black Duck Software, for instance, found that there are only 3.87 AppSec professionals for every 100 developers, which doesn’t bode well for AppSec teams trying to secure an organization’s software all on their own.\n\n\n\nA critical part of learning initiatives is the ability to gauge the progress of developers in the program, both to ensure that developers are qualified to work on the organization’s most sensitive projects and to assess the effectiveness of the program. This upskilling should be ongoing, and you should always look for areas that can be improved. Making use of a tool like SCW’s Trust Score, which uses benchmarks to gauge progress both internally and against industry standards, can help ensure that progress is being made.\n\n\n\nLay the Foundations of Security Maturity\nPart of the challenge of meeting the goals of BSIMM and SAMM is whether organizations are prepared to meet them. Start by building a good foundation in-house with a security-first culture in which security is a business priority and nurturing security-skilled developers is prioritized. Then, implement a Secure-by-Design approach throughout the organization. Doing that will generate the kind of executive and developer buy-in and support needed to really drive the effort of enhancing your enterprise security maturity, and, ultimately, managing the inherent risk introduced by a developer with low security skills and awareness.\n\n\n\nWhether choosing to align with the descriptive BSIMM or the prescriptive SAMM, organizations can help ensure that they can achieve software security maturity by laying the groundwork within their own enterprises, making security best practices an essential part of daily routines, starting with the very first step of creating software code.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Open Source and Software Supply Chain Security\nRelated: How the Secure Development Lifecycle Can Help Protect IIoT Deployments\n\nOrganizations can align their processes with one of two global industry standards for self-assessment and security maturity—the Building Security In Maturity Model, known as BSIMM (pronounced “bee-sim”) and the Open Worldwide Application Security Project’s Software Assurance Maturity Model, aka OWASP SAMM.\n\n\n\nThe frameworks take different approaches to helping organizations uplift their security.

They also need to avoid the kind of restrictive environment that can develop, often unintentionally, when one person who is fully conversant with a system essentially takes control of it, managing it via their own personalized shortcuts and workarounds and preventing others from accessing and understanding the system.\n\n\n\nSecurity leaders can attract both executive-level and developer support by, for example, developing security-focused career paths for developers built on agile, interactive training programs focused on writing secure code and correcting coding errors that can be introduced by open-source or third-party code, as well as coding assistants powered by artificial intelligence, which are becoming increasingly common. It should be part of a security-first mindset that includes architectural oversight for the use of AI and open-source code, and the ability to perform threat modeling and other defensive procedures.\n\n\n\nWith developers under pressure to produce more code than ever before, development teams need to have a high level of security maturity to avoid rework. That necessitates having highly skilled personnel working within a strategic, prevention-focused framework. Developer and AppSec teams must work closely together, as opposed to the old model of operating as separate entities. Today, developers need to assume a significant role in ensuring security best practices. The most recent BSIMM report from Black Duck Software, for instance, found that there are only 3.87 AppSec professionals for every 100 developers, which doesn’t bode well for AppSec teams trying to secure an organization’s software all on their own.\n\n\n\nA critical part of learning initiatives is the ability to gauge the progress of developers in the program, both to ensure that developers are qualified to work on the organization’s most sensitive projects and to assess the effectiveness of the program. This upskilling should be ongoing, and you should always look for areas that can be improved. Making use of a tool like SCW’s Trust Score, which uses benchmarks to gauge progress both internally and against industry standards, can help ensure that progress is being made.\n\n\n\nLay the Foundations of Security Maturity\nPart of the challenge of meeting the goals of BSIMM and SAMM is whether organizations are prepared to meet them. Start by building a good foundation in-house with a security-first culture in which security is a business priority and nurturing security-skilled developers is prioritized. Then, implement a Secure-by-Design approach throughout the organization. Doing that will generate the kind of executive and developer buy-in and support needed to really drive the effort of enhancing your enterprise security maturity, and, ultimately, managing the inherent risk introduced by a developer with low security skills and awareness.\n\n\n\nWhether choosing to align with the descriptive BSIMM or the prescriptive SAMM, organizations can help ensure that they can achieve software security maturity by laying the groundwork within their own enterprises, making security best practices an essential part of daily routines, starting with the very first step of creating software code.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Open Source and Software Supply Chain Security\nRelated: How the Secure Development Lifecycle Can Help Protect IIoT Deployments\n\nThe frameworks take different approaches to helping organizations uplift their security. BSIMM acts as a descriptive model, offering a template of best practices drawn from more than 100 organizations, against which you can compare your secure software initiatives (SSIs). SAMM is prescriptive, offering paths that guide organizations toward secure software programs. What they have in common is that many organizations have found it difficult to meet either of the security models’ objectives, often despite budget increases to pursue defined security outcomes, and receiving executive buy-in for their SSIs.\n\n\n\nWith risk assessments becoming a higher priority even at the executive levels, organizations need to take an approach with developer-driven security that actively targets developer risk management, skills enhancement and strategic repository “gatekeeping.” Initiatives that can help them stay on course while assessing their current security levels and creating an action plan that aligns with BSIMM or OWASP SAMM.\n\n\n\nKnow the Maturity Models\nBSIMM shows you what a software security model looks like, enabling an organization to assess the state of its current SSI, understand how it compares to other SSIs in the industry and measure its progress. Rather than being a step-by-step guide to implementing a secure model, it enables an organization to analyze its program using real data from other organizations and benchmark performance in 12 practices over four domains: Governance, Intelligence (corporate knowledge used in performing secure activities), Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDL) and Deployment.\n\n\n\nIt gives teams visibility into their current state of security maturity, allowing them to develop a strategy for improvement tailored to their organization’s processes.\n\n\n\nOWASP SAMM is an open framework that provides defined steps organizations can take toward security maturity, though it is designed to allow organizations of any size to customize their approach. SAMM divides 12 core practices into five business functions—Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification and Operations—with each function containing two streams that are broken down into three maturity levels.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nOWASP says the solution details are simple enough even for non-security personnel to follow and don’t require that every organization achieves maximum security at every level, although at each stage it does point organizations toward the next level. SAMM helps organizations analyze their current security at any step in the process so they understand where they are in their security maturity journey.\n\n\n\n[ Related: Learn More About Secure Software Development at CodeSecCon! ]\nAlthough both BSIMM and SAMM are established frameworks, many organizations still have trouble following them and achieving intended goals, whether because of the complexity involved (particularly a problem for smaller organizations), resourcing issues, or other roadblocks to success. Before embarking on BSIMM or SAMM, organizations may need first to ensure that developers and security teams are ready to handle the workload, and are equipped with the right tools.\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Developer Upskilling\nOrganizations can no longer afford to have alignment with BSIMM and SAMM as an aspirational goal that would be nice to have someday.

Making use of a tool like SCW’s Trust Score, which uses benchmarks to gauge progress both internally and against industry standards, can help ensure that progress is being made.\n\n\n\nLay the Foundations of Security Maturity\nPart of the challenge of meeting the goals of BSIMM and SAMM is whether organizations are prepared to meet them. Start by building a good foundation in-house with a security-first culture in which security is a business priority and nurturing security-skilled developers is prioritized. Then, implement a Secure-by-Design approach throughout the organization. Doing that will generate the kind of executive and developer buy-in and support needed to really drive the effort of enhancing your enterprise security maturity, and, ultimately, managing the inherent risk introduced by a developer with low security skills and awareness.\n\n\n\nWhether choosing to align with the descriptive BSIMM or the prescriptive SAMM, organizations can help ensure that they can achieve software security maturity by laying the groundwork within their own enterprises, making security best practices an essential part of daily routines, starting with the very first step of creating software code.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Open Source and Software Supply Chain Security\nRelated: How the Secure Development Lifecycle Can Help Protect IIoT Deployments\n\nOWASP says the solution details are simple enough even for non-security personnel to follow and don’t require that every organization achieves maximum security at every level, although at each stage it does point organizations toward the next level. SAMM helps organizations analyze their current security at any step in the process so they understand where they are in their security maturity journey.\n\n\n\n[ Related: Learn More About Secure Software Development at CodeSecCon! ]\nAlthough both BSIMM and SAMM are established frameworks, many organizations still have trouble following them and achieving intended goals, whether because of the complexity involved (particularly a problem for smaller organizations), resourcing issues, or other roadblocks to success. Before embarking on BSIMM or SAMM, organizations may need first to ensure that developers and security teams are ready to handle the workload, and are equipped with the right tools.\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Developer Upskilling\nOrganizations can no longer afford to have alignment with BSIMM and SAMM as an aspirational goal that would be nice to have someday. The growing spate of major breaches in recent years, from SolarWinds to Change Healthcare has underscored the importance of software security. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has responded with its Secure-by-Design initiative promoting secure coding along with other best practices in what is becoming a global effort supported by initiatives in other countries.\n\n\n\nCompanies looking to get on board with Secure by Design—and doing it without compromising the speed of delivery—can begin by establishing an organizational culture that emphasizes code quality, upskilling and skills verification. They also need to avoid the kind of restrictive environment that can develop, often unintentionally, when one person who is fully conversant with a system essentially takes control of it, managing it via their own personalized shortcuts and workarounds and preventing others from accessing and understanding the system.\n\n\n\nSecurity leaders can attract both executive-level and developer support by, for example, developing security-focused career paths for developers built on agile, interactive training programs focused on writing secure code and correcting coding errors that can be introduced by open-source or third-party code, as well as coding assistants powered by artificial intelligence, which are becoming increasingly common. It should be part of a security-first mindset that includes architectural oversight for the use of AI and open-source code, and the ability to perform threat modeling and other defensive procedures.\n\n\n\nWith developers under pressure to produce more code than ever before, development teams need to have a high level of security maturity to avoid rework. That necessitates having highly skilled personnel working within a strategic, prevention-focused framework. Developer and AppSec teams must work closely together, as opposed to the old model of operating as separate entities. Today, developers need to assume a significant role in ensuring security best practices.
