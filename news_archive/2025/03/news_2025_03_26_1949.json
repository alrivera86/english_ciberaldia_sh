        "Content": "The Chinese threat actor known as\nFamousSparrow\nhas been linked to a cyber attack targeting a trade group in the United States and a research institute in Mexico to deliver its flagship backdoor SparrowDoor and ShadowPad.\nThe activity, observed in July 2024, marks the first time the hacking crew has deployed\nShadowPad\n, a malware widely shared by Chinese state-sponsored actors.\n\"FamousSparrow deployed two previously undocumented versions of the SparrowDoor backdoor, one of them modular,\" ESET\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News. \"Both versions constitute considerable progress over previous ones and implement parallelization of commands.\"\nFamousSparrow was\nfirst documented\nby the Slovak cybersecurity company in September 2021 in connection with a series of cyber attacks aimed at hotels, governments, engineering companies, and law firms with SparrowDoor, an implant exclusively used by the group.\nSince then, there have been\nreports\nof the adversarial collective's tactical overlaps with clusters tracked as Earth Estries, GhostEmperor, and most notably, Salt Typhoon, which has been attributed to intrusions aimed at the telecom sector.\nHowever, ESET noted that it's treating FamousSparrow as a distinct threat group with some loose links to\nEarth Estries\nstemming from parallels with Crowdoor and HemiGate.\nThe attack chain involves the threat actor deploying a web shell on an Internet Information Services (IIS) server, although the precise mechanism used to achieve this is unknown as yet. Both the victims are said to have been running outdated versions of Windows Server and Microsoft Exchange Server.\nThe web shell acts as a conduit to drop a batch script from a remote server, which, in turn, launches a Base64-encoded .NET web shell embedded within it. This web shell ultimately is responsible for deploying SparrowDoor and ShadowPad.\nESET said one of the SparrowDoor versions resembles Crowdoor, although both variants feature significant improvements over their predecessor. This includes the ability to simultaneously execute time-consuming commands, such as file I/O and the interactive shell, thereby allowing the backdoor to process incoming instructions while they are being run.\n\"When the backdoor receives one of these commands, it creates a thread that initiates a new connection to the C&C server,\" security researcher Alexandre Côté Cyr said. \"The unique victim ID is then sent over the new connection along with a command ID indicating the command that led to this new connection.\"\n\"This allows the C&C server to keep track of which connections are related to the same victim and what their purposes are. Each of these threads can then handle a specific set of sub-commands.\"\nSparrowDoor sports a wide range of commands that allow it to start a proxy, launch interactive shell sessions, perform file operations, enumerate the file system, gather host information, and even uninstall itself.\nIn contrast, the second version of the backdoor is modular and markedly different from other artifacts, adopting a plugin-based approach to realize its goals. It supports as many as nine different modules -\nCmd - Run a single command\nCFile - Perform file system operations\nCKeylogPlug - Log keystrokes\nCSocket - Launch a TCP proxy\nCShell - Start an interactive shell session\nCTransf - Initiate file transfer between the compromised Windows host and the C&C server\nCRdp - Take screenshots\nCPro - List running processes and kill specific ones\nCFileMoniter - Monitor file system changes for specified directories\n\"This newly found activity indicates that not only is the group still operating, but it was also actively developing new versions of SparrowDoor during this time,\" ESET said.\nFound this article interesting?

It was\nfixed\nby the company earlier this month as part of its Patch Tuesday update.\nTrend Micro has given the exploit the moniker MSC EvilTwin, tracking the suspected Russian activity cluster under the name Water Gamayun. The threat actor, recently the\nsubject of analyses\nby PRODAFT and Outpost24, is also called LARVA-208.\nCVE-2025-26633, at its core, leverages the Microsoft Management Console framework (MMC) to execute a malicious Microsoft Console (.msc) file by means of a PowerShell loader referred to as MSC EvilTwin loader.\nSpecifically, it involves the loader creating two .msc files with the same name: One clean file and its rogue counterpart that is dropped in the same location but within a directory named \"en-US.\" The idea is that when the former is run, MMC inadvertently picks the malicious file instead and executes it. This is accomplished by exploiting MMC's Multilingual User Interface Path (MUIPath) feature.\n\"By abusing the way that mmc.exe uses MUIPath, the attacker can equip MUIPath en-US with a malicious .msc file, which cause the mmc.exe load this malicious file instead of the original file and executed without the victim's knowledge,\" Zahravi explained.\nEncryptHub has also been observed adopting two other methods to run malicious payload on an infected system using .msc files -\nUsing the\nExecuteShellCommand\nmethod of MMC to download and execute a next-stage payload on the victim's machine, an approach\npreviously documented\nby Dutch cybersecurity company Outflank in August 2024\nUsing\nmock trusted directories\nsuch as \"C:\\Windows \\System32\" (note the space after Windows) to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and drop a malicious .msc file called \"WmiMgmt.msc\"\nTrend Micro said the attack chains likely begin with victims downloading digitally-signed Microsoft installer (MSI) files impersonating legitimate Chinese software like DingTalk or QQTalk, which is then used to fetch and execute the loader from a remote server. It's said that the threat actor has been experimenting with these techniques since April 2024.\n\"This campaign is under active development; it employs multiple delivery methods and custom payloads designed to maintain persistence and steal sensitive data, then exfiltrate it to the attackers' command-and-control (C&C) servers,\" Zahravi said.\nFound this article interesting?

It's known to be active since at least November 2018.\nAttack chains\ndocumented\nby Group-IB in 2020 entailed the use of spear-phishing emails bearing Human Resources (HR)-themed lures to activate the malware deployment process. Earlier this January, Huntress\ndetailed\nattacks mounted by the threat actor targeting several organizations in Canada to deploy a loader dubbed RedLoader with \"simple backdoor capabilities.\"\nThen last month, Canadian cybersecurity company eSentire\nrevealed\nRedCurl's use of spam PDF attachments masquerading as CVs and cover letters in phishing messages to sideload the loader malware using the legitimate Adobe executable \"ADNotificationManager.exe.\"\nThe attack sequence detailed by Bitdefender traces the same steps, using mountable disk image (ISO) files disguised as CVs to initiate a multi-stage infection procedure. Present within the disk image is a file that mimics a Windows screensaver (SCR) but, in reality, is the ADNotificationManager.exe binary that's used to execute the loader (\"netutils.dll\") using DLL side-loading.\n\"After execution, the netutils.dll immediately launches a ShellExecuteA call with the open verb, directing the victim's browser to https://secure.indeed.com/auth,\" Martin Zugec, technical solutions director at Bitdefender, said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\"This displays a legitimate Indeed login page, a calculated distraction designed to mislead the victim into thinking they are simply opening a CV. This social engineering tactic provides a window for the malware to operate undetected.\"\nImage Source: eSentire\nThe loader, per Bitdefender, also acts as a downloader for a next-stage backdoor DLL, while also establishing persistence on the host by means of a scheduled task. The newly retrieved DLL is then executed using Program Compatibility Assistant (pcalua.exe), a technique\ndetailed\nby Trend Micro in March 2024.\nThe access afforded by the implant paves the way for lateral movement, allowing the threat actor to navigate the network, gather intelligence, and further escalate their access. But in what appears to be a major pivot from their established modus operandi, one such attack also led to the deployment of ransomware for the first time.\n\"This focused targeting can be interpreted as an attempt to inflict maximum damage with minimum effort,\" Zugec said. \"By encrypting the virtual machines hosted on the hypervisors, making them unbootable, RedCurl effectively disables the entire virtualized infrastructure, impacting all hosted services.\"\nThe ransomware executable, besides employing the bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) technique to disable endpoint security software, takes steps to gather system information prior to launching the encryption routine. What's more, the ransom note dropped following encryption appears to be inspired by LockBit, HardBit, and Mimic groups.\n\"This practice of repurposing existing ransom note text raises questions about the origins and motivations of the RedCurl group,\" Zugec said. \"Notably, there is no known dedicated leak site (DLS) associated with this ransomware, and it remains unclear whether the ransom note represents a genuine extortion attempt or a diversion.\"\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

The second package, likely removed by the malware author themselves, did not attract any downloads.\n\"They were simple downloaders whose malicious payload was cleverly hidden,\" ReversingLabs researcher Lucija Valentić\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\"The interesting part lay in their second stage, which would 'patch' the legitimate npm package\nethers\n, installed locally, with a new file containing the malicious payload. That patched file would ultimately serve a reverse shell.\"\nThe development marks a new escalation of threat actors' tactics, as uninstalling the rogue packages won't rid compromised machines of the malicious functionality, since the changes reside in the popular library. On top of that, if an unsuspecting user removes the ethers package when ethers-provider2 remains on the system, it risks reinfection when the package is installed again at a later time.\nReversingLabs' analysis of ethers-provider2 has revealed that it's nothing but a trojanized version of the widely-used\nssh2\nnpm package that includes a malicious payload within install.js to retrieve a second-stage malware from a remote server (\"5.199.166[.]1:31337/install\"), write it to a temporary file, and run it.\nImmediately after execution, the temporary file is deleted from the system in an attempt to avoid leaving any traces. The second-stage payload, for its part, starts an infinite loop to check if the npm package ethers is installed locally.\nIn the event the package is already present or it gets freshly installed, it springs into action by replacing one of the files named \"provider-jsonrpc.js\" with a counterfeit version that packs in additional code to fetch and execute a third-stage from the same server. The newly downloaded payload functions as a reverse shell to connect to the threat actor's server over SSH.\n\"That means that the connection opened with this client turns into a reverse shell once it receives a custom message from the server,\" Valentić said. \"Even if the package ethers-provider2 is removed from a compromised system, the client will still be used under certain circumstances, providing a degree of persistence for the attackers.\"\nIt's worth noting at this stage that the official ethers package on the npm registry is not compromised, since the malicious modifications are made locally post installation.\nThe second package, ethers-providerz, also behaves in a similar manner in that it attempts to alter files associated with a locally installed npm package called \"@ethersproject/providers.\" The exact npm package targeted by the library is not known, although source code references indicate it could have been\nloader.js\n.\nThe findings serve to highlight the novel ways threat actors are serving and persisting malware in developer systems, making it essential that packages from open-source repositories are carefully scrutinized before downloading and using them.\n\"Despite the low download numbers, these packages are powerful and malicious,\" Valentić said. \"If their mission is successful, they will corrupt the locally installed package ethers and maintain persistence on compromised systems even if that package is removed.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "\"A boxer derives the greatest advantage from his sparring partner…\"\n— Epictetus, 50–135 AD\nHands up. Chin tucked. Knees bent.\nThe bell rings, and both boxers meet in the center and circle. Red throws out three jabs, feints a fourth, and—BANG—lands a right hand on Blue down the center.\nThis wasn't Blue's first day and despite his solid defense in front of the mirror, he feels the pressure. But something changed in the ring; the variety of punches, the feints, the intensity – it's nothing like his coach's simulations.\nIs my defense strong enough to withstand this?\nHe wonders,\ndo I even have a defense?\nHis coach reassures him \"If it weren't for all your practice, you wouldn't have defended those first jabs. You've got a defense—now you need to calibrate it. And that happens in the ring.\"\nCybersecurity is no different. You can have your hands up—deploying the right architecture, policies, and security measures—but the smallest gap in your defense could let an attacker land a knockout punch. The only way to test your readiness is under pressure, sparring in the ring.\nThe Difference Between Practice and the Real Fight\nIn boxing, sparring partners are abundant. Every day, fighters step into the ring to hone their skills against real opponents. But in cybersecurity, sparring partners are more sparse. The equivalent is penetration testing, but a pentest happens at a typical organization only once a year, maybe twice, at best every quarter. It requires extensive preparation, contracting an expensive specialist agency, and cordoning off the environment to be tested. As a result, security teams often go months without facing true adversarial activity. They're compliant, their hands are up and their chins are tucked. But would they be resilient under attack?\nThe Consequences of Infrequent Testing\n1. Drift: The Slow Erosion of Defense\nWhen a boxer goes months without sparring, their intuition dulls. He falls victim to the concept known as \"inches\" where he has the right defensive move but he misses it by inches, getting caught by shots he knows how to defend. In cybersecurity, this is akin to\nconfiguration drift\n: incremental changes in the environment, whether that be new users, outdated assets, no longer attended ports, or a gradual loss in defensive calibration. Over time, gaps emerge, not because the defenses are gone, but because they've fallen out of alignment.\n2. Undetected Gaps: The Limits of Shadowboxing\nA boxer and their coach can only get so far in training. Shadowboxing and drills help, but the coach won't call out inconspicuous mistakes, that could leave the boxer vulnerable. Neither can they replicate the unpredictability of a real opponent. There are simply too many things that can go wrong. The only way for a coach to assess the state of his boxer is to see how he gets hit and then diagnose why.\nSimilarly, in cybersecurity, the attack surface is vast and constantly evolving. No one pentesting assessment can anticipate every possible attack vector and detect every vulnerability. The only way to uncover gaps is to test repeatedly against real attack scenarios.\n3. Limited Testing Scope: The Danger of Partial Testing\nA coach needs to see their fighter tested against a variety of opponents. He may be fine against an opponent who throws primarily headshots, but what about body punchers or counterpunchers? These may be areas for improvement. If a security team only tests against a particular type of threat, and doesn't broaden their range to other exploits, be they exposed passwords or misconfigurations, they risk leaving themselves exposed to whatever weak access points an attacker finds. For example, a web application might be secure, but what about a leaked credential or a dubious API integration?\nContext Matters When it Comes to Prioritizing Fixes\nNot every vulnerability is a knockout punch. Just as a boxer's unique style can compensate for technical flaws, compensating controls in cybersecurity can mitigate risks. Take Muhammad Ali, by textbook standards, his defense was flawed, but his athleticism and adaptability made him untouchable. Similarly, Floyd Mayweather's low front hand might seem like a weakness, but his shoulder roll turned it into a defensive strength.\nIn cybersecurity, vulnerability scanners often highlight dozens—if not hundreds—of issues. But not all of them are critical. All IT environments are different and a high-severity CVE might be neutralized by a compensating control, such as network segmentation or strict access policies. Context is key because it provides the necessary understanding of what requires immediate attention versus what doesn't.\nThe High Cost of Infrequent Testing\nThe value of testing against a real adversary is nothing new. Boxers spar to prepare for fights. Cybersecurity teams conduct penetration tests to harden their defenses. But what if boxers had to pay tens of thousands of dollars every time they sparred? Their learning would only happen in the ring—during the fight—and the cost of failure would be devastating.\nThis is the reality for many organizations. Traditional penetration testing is expensive, time-consuming, and often limited in scope. As a result, many teams only test once or twice a year, leaving their defenses unchecked for months. When an attack occurs, the gaps are exposed—and the cost is high.\nContinuous, Proactive Testing\nTo truly harden their defenses, organizations must move beyond infrequent annual testing. Instead, they need\ncontinuous, automated testing\nthat emulates real-world attacks. These tools emulate adversarial activity, uncovering gaps and providing actionable insights into where to tighten security controls, how to recalibrate defenses, and provide precise fixes for remediation. Doing it all with regular frequency and without the high cost of traditional testing.\nBy combining automated security validation with human expertise, organizations can maintain a strong defensive posture and adapt to evolving threats.\nLearn more about automated pentesting by visiting\nPentera\n.\nNote:\nThis article is expertly written and contributed by William Schaffer, Senior Sales Development Representative at Pentera.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "When people think of cybersecurity threats, they often picture external hackers breaking into networks. However, some of the most damaging breaches stem from within organizations. Whether through negligence or malicious intent, insiders can expose your organization to significant cybersecurity risks.\nAccording to Verizon's\n2024 Data Breach Investigations Report\n, 57% of companies experience over 20 insider-related security incidents a year, with human error involved in 68% of data breaches. With that, insider attacks result in the highest costs, averaging USD 4.99 million per attack, as per the\n2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report\nby IBM Security.\nWhat are insider threats?\nAn insider threat\noriginates from within an organization – it's the potential for anyone with authorized access to your critical systems to misuse their access, harming your organization. The worst part is that insiders are already within your IT perimeter and are familiar with your internal security protocols, which makes their illicit activity harder to detect.\nInsider threats fall into three primary categories:\nMalicious insiders\n– employees or contractors intentionally abusing their access for financial gain, sabotage, IP theft, or espionage.\nNegligent insiders\n– careless employees mishandling credentials, sharing passwords, or violating cybersecurity policies.\nCompromised insiders\n– legitimate users who have been outsmarted by an external attacker.\nThe consequences of insider threats range from financial losses and reputational damage to severe penalties for non-compliance with critical cybersecurity laws, regulations, and standards like GDPR, NIS2, or HIPAA.\nWhat makes insider threats especially dangerous is the level of access certain users have within an organization. Not all accounts are made equal — privileged accounts, in particular, pose an increased risk.\nFor example, in December 2024, an insider threat incident occurred within the U.S. Treasury Department when members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team were mistakenly granted elevated access to critical payment systems. The DOGE team had the ability to read and modify sensitive system codes, which could lead to serious consequences for the U.S. Treasury Department and its clients.\nThis situation underscores the necessity for robust\nPrivileged Access Management (PAM)\nsolutions to prevent unauthorized access and potential system compromises.\nWhy privileged accounts become a liability\nAccounts with elevated permissions are among the most desired targets for both insiders and external attackers. These accounts often have access to sensitive systems, enabling users to modify configurations and interact with critical data. When mismanaged, they can lead to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, operational disruptions, and other security incidents.\nBy implementing PAM best practices and using dedicated solutions, organizations can considerably reduce their attack surface and minimize the risk of insider-driven breaches.\nExplore PAM's transformative impact on businesses in the white paper\nThe Cyber Guardian: PAM's Role in Shaping Leadership Agendas for 2025\nby a cybersecurity expert and former Gartner lead analyst Jonathan Care.\nHow PAM helps mitigate insider threats\nPrivileged access management solutions empower organizations to control, monitor, and secure privileged access effectively. Here's how PAM helps neutralize insider risks:\n1. Identifying and managing privileged accounts\nA common challenge for organizations is the lack of visibility into existing privileged accounts, which creates security blind spots. If you're not aware of some privileged accounts within your environment, you can't secure them.\nAdvanced PAM solutions help automate privileged account discovery, identifying hidden and orphaned accounts within your environment. By continuously scanning and onboarding unmanaged privileged accounts, you can significantly reduce overlooked access points that could be exploited by bad actors.\n2. Supporting the principle of least privilege\nOne of the core tenets of PAM is the principle of least privilege (PoLP), which ensures that employees, contractors, or service accounts are only granted access they require to perform their duties. PoLP ensures that no single user has unrestricted, standing privileges, which drastically reduces the risk of privilege misuse.\nPAM solutions help enforce PoLP by allowing security teams to dynamically adjust access based on users' roles and responsibilities.\n3. Implementing just-in-time PAM\nPersistent privileged access increases the attack surface. For example, a developer working on a critical update may need temporary access to your production servers. However, if you leave their elevated permissions in place after the update is complete, this may create an unnecessary security risk. In the future, attackers can exploit those privileges to gain unauthorized access and move laterally within your network.\nPAM solutions like\nSyteca\nenable you to grant on-demand privileged access for specific tasks and revoke elevated access upon their completion.\n4. Enforcing identity-first approach\nAccording to Gartner's\nIdentity and Access Management Primer for 2025\n(subscription required), an identity-first approach is essential for modern organizational security. Adopting this approach means shifting from static network security measures to continuous adaptive trust and zero trust approaches that ensure user identities are verified and authorized before accessing sensitive systems.\nBy applying multi-factor authentication to every access point, organizations can minimize unauthorized access and lateral movement across their systems.\n5. Protecting remote access\nAs remote work and third-party collaborations have become essential, ensuring secure access to your sensitive systems for external users is vital. PAM solutions can help you verify user identities and grant remote users time-limited, task-specific access to your systems.\nThis level of control can help you ensure that your critical systems remain protected even when accessed from outside your corporate network, from diverse locations.\n6. Securing credentials with vaulting and rotation\nSimple, reused, or improperly stored passwords remain a major weak link for many organizations. PAM solutions can secure privileged credentials by storing them in an encrypted vault and automatically updating passwords, making compromised passwords useless over time.\nCentralized password management not only enhances security but also saves time for IT teams by eliminating manual password resets and reducing password-related service requests.\n7. Monitoring privileged activity\nWithout proper oversight of privileged user sessions, organizations can fail to detect early signs of insider threats, resulting in data breaches that are hard and costly to remediate.\nPAM solutions with user activity monitoring (UAM) capabilities enable security teams to oversee all interactions with critical systems in real time and, thus, spot events that could signify an insider threat. Comprehensive cybersecurity platforms like Syteca can flag potential insider threats by sending real-time notifications to security teams.\n8. Automating insider threat response\nWith the automation provided by PAM solutions, organizations significantly reduce the time to detect and respond to insider threats, minimizing potential financial, operational, and reputational damage.\nFor instance, Syteca not only sends real-time alerts on abnormal user activity but also automatically blocks suspicious users, warns them with a message, and blocks unapproved USB devices.\nBeyond insider threats: The other benefits of PAM\nWhile mitigating insider threats is a compelling reason to adopt PAM solutions, the advantages extend far beyond insider threat management.\nEnhancing operational efficiency.\nAutomating access management with PAM tools reduces manual interventions and streamlines IT operations. Automation speeds up the provisioning and de-provisioning of access rights, reduces administrative overhead, and minimizes human errors. Consequently, IT teams can focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine tasks.​\nStreamlining regulatory compliance.\nMany organizations must adhere to cybersecurity regulations that require strict access controls and thorough audits. PAM solutions streamline compliance by providing detailed logs of privileged account activities, simplifying the auditing process, and ensuring adherence to standards, laws, and regulations such as the GDPR, PCI DSS, and NIS2.\nBoosting employee productivity.\nWith automated password management, secure password sharing between teams, and single sign-on features, many PAM solutions minimize the time employees spend dealing with access issues. This efficiency leads to increased productivity, as users can access necessary systems promptly without compromising security.​\nOverall, implementing a robust PAM solution not only fortifies your organization's security against insider threats but also delivers a multitude of benefits that drive operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and productivity growth. By embracing PAM, you're investing in a secure, efficient, and resilient future for your organization.\nSyteca: Powerful, flexible, and cost-effective PAM\nSyteca is a comprehensive cybersecurity platform that provides a holistic approach to insider threat prevention.

        "Summary": "230M stolen passwords met complexity requirements—and were still compromised. Passwords aren't going away for now, but there are new technologies that may increasingly replace them. Learn more from Specops Software about how to protect your passwords. [...]",
        "Date": "2025-03-26",
        "Content": "Many of us have moved beyond passwords alone for online security, and it’s not hard to see why. Our new Specops Breached Password Report found that\nof one billion stolen credentials, almost a quarter met standard complexity requirements\n– and still the criminals broke through.\nThese stolen passwords – 230 million of them – met all the requirements of their organization, including more than eight characters, one capital letter, a special character and a number.\nAnd there’s plenty more evidence of password vulnerabilities: Verizon’s Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2024 found that stolen credentials were the\ntop action leading to a breach\n.\nAlternatives to passwords\nSo it’s little wonder that new and evolving authentication methods have gained traction in recent years. But could they replace passwords altogether? We think the answer is a likely ‘no’. Passwords will remain a key security element for most orgniazations, with additional authentication methods used to enhance defenses.\nFirst, let’s look at some of the developing alternatives and technologies that could transform traditional approaches to passwords.\nSecure your Active Directory passwords with Specops Password Policy\nVerizon’s Data Breach Investigation Report found stolen credentials are involved in 44.7% of breaches.\nEffortlessly secure Active Directory with compliant password policies, blocking 4+ billion compromised passwords, boosting security, and slashing support hassles!\nTry it for free\nBiometric authentication\nBiometric authentication uses a person’s physical attributes to confirm their identity: for example, fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans etc. There are obvious advantages: fingerprints, for instance, are unique to an individual, so they can’t easily be mimicked or replicated.\nThe technology is also simple to use, avoiding the need to input data that could be easily forgotten.\nBut biometric authentication isn’t invulnerable. For example, biometric spoofing could exploit fake versions of a face or other biometric data to attempt to fool a system. Authentication systems that have no liveness checks can be particularly vulnerable to deepfake attacks.\nAnd if the system is compromised, you can’t just reset biometric data, like you would a password.\nBehavioral biometrics\nLike biometric authentication, behavioral biometrics\nrelies on characteristics that are unique to an individual\n. Except this time, it’s the way you interact with the application or website in question: for instance, how you move your mouse or type on the keyboard.\nThere are obvious benefits – the user doesn’t have to do anything special, so it’s convenient to use. It also mitigates the danger of credential sharing, as you can’t easily share your typing rhythm.\nBut again, it can be costly to set up and there are potential concerns around data privacy in the event of a breach.\nBlockchain for secure password storage\nBlockchain could provide a highly secure method to secure data. As utilized in cryptocurrency, it provides\nan incorruptible method of distributing data across a decentralized network\n. However, there remain questions around the possible cost of storing passwords on blockchain ledgers like Bitcoin.\nZero-knowledge proof technology\nZKP proves the truthfulness of a mathematical statement, without revealing additional information\n‘that may have been useful in finding said truthfulness’, as noted by NIST.\nIn passwords, this provides a secure way to let users prove that they know their own password, without any need to transmit their actual credentials – it is a cryptographic method that proves you know your password\nwithout needing to actually submit your credentials\n.\nIn other words, you can prove who you are without risking your data.\nHowever,\nchallenges could include the processing power required for ZKP\nand potential issues around complexity.\nPassphrases\nAnother alternative to traditional passwords is the use of passphrases. Unlike standard passwords, which are often short and complex, passphrases consist of multiple words strung together, creating a longer but more memorable authentication method.\nFor example, a passphrase like \"PurpleBananaSunsetDancer!\" is easier to remember than a random string of letters and numbers, while still providing strong security due to its length.\nPassphrases are particularly effective against brute-force attacks, as their extended length exponentially increases the number of possible combinations.\nHowever, they still rely on user-generated input, meaning they can be vulnerable if common phrases or predictable word patterns are used.\nYou can find a full guide on moving to passphrases here\n.\nPasskeys\nPasskeys are phishing-resistant alternatives to passwords that have been growing in popularity over the last couple of years. Based on FIDO2, passkeys use public key cryptography to authenticate users and log them into websites and apps. A passkey is typically tied to a device, such as a phone or computer, and can be unlocked using biometrics or a PIN.\nPasskeys are resistant to credential stuffing and phishing attacks because the private key used for authentication is securely stored on users' devices and never shared with websites or transmitted over the internet. As a result, there are no credentials that can be stolen in phishing attacks or data breaches.\nPasskeys are now widely supported on all major platforms, including\nGoogle\n,\nApple\n, and\nMicrosoft\n.\nSecurity keys\nSecurity keys are physical devices, usually USB, NFC, or Bluetooth, that are most commonly used for multi-factor authentication (MFA). After entering a password, users tap the security key or enter a PIN to verify their identity, which allows the user to log in to the site or application.\nHowever, some platforms now use them for password-less logins where the owner uses a PIN or biometrics to prove that they are the owner and to allow logins. Support for password-less logins using security keys is currently available in\nWindows\n,\nSecurity keys are resistant to attacks as they not only require access to the physical device but also the biometrics and PIN required to authenticate the login.\nThe enduring advantages of passwords\nMany of these techniques have been available for some time, yet passwords remain the foundation of online security, used daily by consumers and businesses across the globe. Why is this?\nSimple and universal: the concept has been established for decades and is easy for everyone to understand.\nFlexibility: you can easily reset your password. You can’t say the same thing for a facial scan or fingerprints.\nEffectiveness: passwords are either right or wrong.\nEven when biometric scanners fail or security tokens go missing\n, passwords remain a reliable backup authentication method.\nThe best of both worlds\nThe optimum approach isn’t to choose between passwords and some other form of security. Instead, we should embrace the advantages of new technologies, while retaining the convenience and security of passwords.\nThe solution is to opt for the best of both worlds by building multi-factor authentication, going beyond two-factor authentication to build in as many layers of security as possible.\nThis could involve the use of a code texted to your phone\nalongside a facial scan and the use of a password.\nEven here, vulnerabilities remain.\nMFA\ncan be targeted\nthrough methods like prompt bombing or adversary-in-the-middle attacks\n, often based on exploiting a weak password.\nThey key is therefore to ensure your passwords are as robust as possible, no matter what technology you use to enhance your security.\nSpecops Secure Access\n: Secure password reset with integrated multi-factor authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access\nScan your Active Directory for compromised passwords\nAuthentication technologies will continue to advance, but you’ll always need to stay on top of your passwords.\nSpecops Password Policy\nCompliance Report\nEnforcing strong password policies by identifying and blocking compromised credentials to enhance security posture\nSpecops Password Policy\nintegrates with your Active Directory to continuously block a growing database of more than 4 billion compromised passwords\n, while preventing users from creating weak passwords and scanning for passwords that have been compromised or breached.\nContact us today for your free trial\n.\nSponsored and written by\nSpecops Software\n."

        "Content": "A threat actor named 'RedCurl,' known for stealthy corporate espionage operations since 2018, is now using a ransomware encryptor designed to target Hyper-V virtual machines.\nPreviously, RedCurl was spotted by Group-IB targeting\ncorporate entities worldwide\n, later expanding its operations and\nincreasing the victim count\n.\nHowever, as Bitdefender Labs researchers report, the threat actors have started deploying ransomware on compromised networks.\n\"We've seen RedCurl stick to their usual playbook in most cases, continuing with data exfiltration over longer periods of time,\" reads the\nBitdefender report\n.\n\"However, one case stood out. They broke their routine and deployed ransomware for the first time.\"\nAs the enterprise increasingly moves to virtual machines to host their servers, ransomware gangs have followed the trend, creating encryptors that specifically target virtualization platforms.\nWhile most ransomware operations focus on targeting VMware ESXi servers, RedCurl's new \"QWCrypt\" ransomware specifically targets virtual machines hosted on Hyper-V.\nQWCrypt attacks\nThe attacks observed by Bitdefender start with phishing emails with \".IMG\" attachments disguised as CVs. IMG files are disk image files that are automatically mounted by Windows under a new drive letter when they are double-clicked.\nThe IMG files contain a screensaver file vulnerable to DLL sideloading using a legitimate Adobe executable, which downloads a payload and sets persistence via a scheduled task.\nRedCurl leverages \"living-off-the-land\" tools to maintain stealth on Windows systems, uses a custom wmiexec variant to spread laterally in the network without triggering security tools, and uses the tool 'Chisel' for tunneling/RDP access.\nTo turn off defenses before the ransomware deployment, the attackers use encrypted 7z archives and a multi-stage PowerShell process.\nUnlike many Windows ransomware encryptors, QWCrypt supports numerous command-line arguments that control how the encryptor will target Hyper-V virtual machines to customize attacks.\n--excludeVM string      Exclude VMs (csv list)\r\n     --hv                    Encrypt HyperV VMs\r\n     --kill                  Kill VM process\r\n     --turnoff               TurnOff HyperV VMs (default true)\nIn attacks seen by Bitdefender, RedCurl utilized the --excludeVM argument to avoid encrypting virtual machines that acted as network gateways to avoid disruption.\nWhen encrypting files, the researchers say that QWCrypt ('rbcw.exe') uses the XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption algorithm and appends either the .locked$ or .randombits$ extension to encrypted files.\nThe encryptor also offers the option to use intermittent encryption (block skipping) or selective file encryption based on size for increased speed.\nThe ransom note created by QWCrypt is named \"!!!how_to_unlock_randombits_files.txt$\" and contains a mixture of text from LockBit, HardBit, and Mimic ransom notes.\nThe absence of a dedicated leak site for double extortion raises questions on whether RedCurl is using ransomware as a false flag or for true extortion attacks.\nMoney, disruption, or diversion?\nBitdefender outlines two main hypotheses for why RedCurl now includes ransomware in its operations.\nThe first is that RedCurl operates as a mercenary group offering services to third parties, which results in a mix of espionage operations and financially motivated attacks.\nIn some situations, the ransomware could be a distraction to cover for data theft, or a fallback to monetize access when a client fails to pay for their primary services (data collection).\nThe second theory is that RedCurl does engage in ransomware operations for enrichment, but opts to do so silently, preferring private negotiations over public ransom demands and data leaks.\n\"The RedCurl group's recent deployment of ransomware marks a significant evolution in their tactics,\" concludes Bitdefender.\n\"This departure from their established modus operandi raises critical questions about their motivations and operational objectives.\"\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nHunters International ransomware claims attack on Tata Technologies\nQilin ransomware claims attack at Lee Enterprises, leaks stolen data\nChinese espionage tools deployed in RA World ransomware attack\nChinese Weaver Ant hackers spied on telco network for 4 years\nSilk Typhoon hackers now target IT supply chains to breach networks"

The author has removed it from npm and may plan to reintroduce it after fixing those errors.\nThe researchers also mentioned two more packages, namely 'reproduction-hardhat' and '@theoretical123/providers', that appear to be linked to the same campaign.\nReversing Labs has included a YARA rule to detect known malware associated with this campaign, so developers should use it to scan their environments for remnant threats.\nIn general, when downloading packages from package indexes like PyPI and npm, it is recommended to double-check their legitimacy (and that of their publisher) and examine their code for signs of risk, such as obfuscated code and calls to external servers.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nNorth Korean Lazarus hackers infect hundreds via npm packages\nDeepSeek AI tools impersonated by infostealer malware on PyPI\nChinese Weaver Ant hackers spied on telco network for 4 years\nCritical Cisco Smart Licensing Utility flaws now exploited in attacks\nRansomHub ransomware uses new Betruger ‘multi-function’ backdoor"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nAMTSO has developed a Sandbox Evaluation Framework to standardize the testing of malware analysis solutions. \nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nAMTSO, the cybersecurity industry’s testing standards community, on Wednesday announced the creation of a sandbox evaluation framework whose goal is to standardize the testing of sandbox-based malware analysis solutions. \nSandbox systems are increasingly important in the analysis of malware and other potential threats, but it can be challenging to determine which solution is the best for a user’s specific requirements. \n\n\n\nAMTSO’s Sandbox Evaluation Framework aims to address this by providing a list of criteria and a scoring system to help researchers, vendors and other members of the cybersecurity industry with evaluating and comparing sandboxes. \n\n\n\nFor instance, inline protection sandboxes have a very low latency and are good for real-time protection, which makes them ideal for products such as email gateways and web application firewalls.

The startup closed a pre-seed funding round in September 2024.\n\n\n\nFounded in 2023, the US-based SplxAI says many large enterprises rely on its security platform for the detection, triaging, and remediation of risks in AI agents in real-time.\n\n\n\nThe platform relies on automated security testing, continuous monitoring, and dynamic remediation to secure internal AI agents and customer-facing AI systems, preventing attacks such as prompt injections, hallucinations, and off-topic responses.\n\n\n\nLeveraging a continuously updated database of threats and vulnerabilities, SplxAI’s platform simulates sophisticated adversarial scenarios across text, image, and voice, to automatically detect and address potential attack vectors.\n\n\n\nSplxAI relies on hundreds of advanced attack scenarios for automated testing, continuously analyzes logs to identify threat activity, and enables secure and compliant gen-AI development.\n\n\n\nRecently, the company announced Agentic Radar, an open source tool for identifying components in agentic workflows, discovering links with missing security measures, and mapping dependencies.\n\n\n\nThe startup will use the new investment to accelerate the development and adoption of its AI security platform.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“Deploying AI agents at scale introduces significant complexity, creating potential vulnerabilities that only in-depth, continuous testing can uncover. With the rapid advancement of LLMs, manual testing is not feasible. SplxAI’s advanced platform is the only scalable solution for securing agentic AI, providing security leaders with the tools they need to confidently embrace AI,” SplxAI co-founder and CEO Kristian Kamber said.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the new funding, SplxAI announced that Sandy Dunn is joining the company as its CISO. Previously, Dunn served as security officer at Brand Engagement Network, BreachQuest, Blue Cross of Idaho, and HP.\n\n\n\nRelated: Charm Security Emerges From Stealth With $8 Million in Funding\nRelated: Orion Security Raises $6 Million to Tackle Insider Threats and Data Leaks with AI-Driven DLP\nRelated: VulnCheck Raises $12 Million for Vulnerability Intelligence Platform\nRelated: 360 Privacy Raises $36 Million for Digital Executive Protection Platform\n\nThe new funding round was led by LAUNCHub Ventures, with additional support from DNV Ventures, Inovo, Rain Capital, Runtime Ventures, and South Central Ventures.

An attacker could, for instance, covertly monitor live camera feeds (both video and audio).\n\n\n\n“This could facilitate industrial espionage, allowing competitors or malicious actors to spy on proprietary manufacturing processes and gain insights into workflow optimizations, specialized machinery usage, or product assembly techniques. Additionally, it raises privacy concerns, as employees could be unknowingly monitored,” Nozomi explained, adding that “attackers could analyze security weaknesses, such as unattended machinery or shift changes, to plan further actions.”\n\n\n\nThe security firm also warned that the forced browsing vulnerability can be exploited to manipulate or delete footage. \n\n\n\n“This could result in the loss of critical diagnostic footage, making it difficult to analyze and resolve operational inefficiencies, leading to prolonged downtime and increased costs. In industries that require stoppage recordings for quality control or regulatory compliance, missing or altered footage could result in production recalls,” Nozomi said. \n\n\n\n“Additionally, a malicious insider could erase or modify footage to conceal intentional disruptions, equipment failures, or workplace incidents, without being detected.”to conceal intentional disruptions, workplace incidents, or equipment failures,” it added.Advertisement.

Instead, the vendor has urged customers to implement mitigations, such as restricting access to the cameras and protecting them with firewalls and other security systems. \n\n\n\nAdvisories for the Inaba camera vulnerabilities have also been published by CISA and Japan’s JPCERT/CC. \n\n\n\nWhile Nozomi says that the impacted product is commonly found in Japanese plants, CISA’s advisory indicates that the cameras are deployed worldwide.\n\n\n\nLearn More at SecurityWeek’s ICS Cybersecurity ConferenceThe leading global conference series for Operations, Control Systems and OT/IT Security professionals to connect on SCADA, DCS PLC and field controller cybersecurity.October 27-30, 2025 | Atlantawww.icscybersecurityconference.com\nRelated: China’s Volt Typhoon Hackers Dwelled in US Electric Grid for 300 Days\nRelated: Details Disclosed for SCADA Flaws That Could Facilitate Industrial Attacks\nRelated: ICS Patch Tuesday: Advisories Published by CISA, Schneider Electric, Siemens\n\nInaba Denki Sangyo manufactures air conditioning, electrical installation, and control system products.\n\n\n\nResearchers at industrial and IoT security firm Nozomi Networks have analyzed the company’s Choco Tei Watcher Mini (IB-MCT001) camera, which is used to monitor plants for production disruptions and analyze incidents.\n\n\n\n\nNozomi researchers discovered that the camera is affected by four types of vulnerabilities, including critical issues related to weak password requirements and forced browsing, a high-severity issue related to the use of client-side authentication, and a medium-severity flaw related to the storage of passwords.\n\n\n\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities to take full control of a device.

We observed distribution of the newer variants through existing infections of the older ReaderUpdate,” SentinelOne notes.\n\n\n\nThe malware has been distributed via free and third-party software download sites, including through malicious package installers containing fake or trojanized utility applications. All observed variants only target the x86 Intel architecture.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the Go variant of ReaderUpdate has revealed that, upon execution, the malware would first collect information on the system’s hardware, which is then used to create a unique identifier and sent to the C&C.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it has revealed that the threat can parse and execute responses received from the C&C, which suggests that it could be used to execute any commands that its operator sends.\n\n\n\n“While to date ReaderUpdate infections have only been associated with known adware, the loader has the capability to change the payload to something more malicious.

It allows developers to decrease site loading times and improve search engine optimization (SEO).\n\n\n\nTracked as CVE-2025-29927 (CVSS score of 9.1), the critical-severity flaw was publicly disclosed on March 21, one week after patches were rolled out in Next.js versions 15.2.3 and 14.2.25. The fixes were also included in Next.js versions 13.5.9 and 12.3.5, which were released over the weekend.\n\n\n\nNext.js relies on middleware for processing HTTP requests. Middleware is also responsible for authentication, authorization, and setting security headers, and the internal header ‘x-middleware-subrequest’ is used to manage these processes and prevent infinite loops.\n\n\n\nThe improper validation of the internal header, which has a predictable value, allows an attacker to send crafted requests mimicking the header and bypass authentication checks within a Next.js application.\n\n\n\n“When the middleware is bypassed, the app does not perform its normal security routines, such as identity or role verification, leading to potential unauthorized access to sensitive or restricted parts of the application,” Akamai explains, warning that the security defect can be exploited without authentication.\n\n\n\nWhile multiple versions of Next.js are impacted, exploitation methods vary by version. According to Rapid7, the potential impact of the flaw varies by application, depending on middleware configuration and on the application’s purpose.\n\n\n\n“Organizations should consider whether their applications are relying solely on the middleware for authentication. It may be that the application uses middleware, but is just acting as a front end to back-end APIs that are dealing with server-side authentication logic. Bypassing the front-end Next.js middleware would not affect the back-end’s ability to authenticate users,” Rapid7 notes.Advertisement.

The hacker claims to have obtained six million lines of data, including SSO and LDAP passwords.   \n\n\n\n“There has been no breach of Oracle Cloud,” an Oracle spokesperson told SecurityWeek on Monday. “The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data.”\n\n\n\nHowever, there appears to be increasing evidence to the contrary. After showing that they were able to upload an arbitrary file to Oracle Cloud systems, rose87168 provided sample data consisting of roughly 10,000 records to several security firms in an effort to demonstrate the hacking claims.\n\n\n\nHudson Rock co-founder and CTO Alon Gal reported on Tuesday that he had received confirmation from several customers using Oracle Cloud that the leaked data is genuine and is associated with a production environment. Some customers said the exposed accounts have access to sensitive data.\n\n\n\nOne customer told Gal that the leaked data dates to late 2023, but the hacker claims data from 2025 was also compromised.\n\n\n\nCloudSEK has also analyzed the sample data and other information provided by the hacker and found evidence indicating that there was some sort of breach of Oracle Cloud systems and real user data was compromised. \n\n\n\n“The volume and structure of the leaked information make it extremely difficult to fabricate, reinforcing the credibility of the breach,” CloudSEK noted.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThe company has developed a simple online tool that allows organizations to check whether they are impacted by this data breach.\n\n\n\nThreat intelligence company Kela has also analyzed the sample data made available by the hacker and told SecurityWeek that it found 1,547 unique domain names (mostly related to private firms) and 1,510 distinct tenant IDs. \n\n\n\nThe security firm has identified victims across 90 countries, with the highest percentages in the UK, the US, Italy, France and Germany. It also discovered domains associated with governments and related public entities in the US, UK, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Belgium, Austria and Brazil.\n\n\n\nThere is some indication that the attack on Oracle Cloud systems may involve the exploitation of a vulnerability in Oracle’s own products. One likely candidate is CVE-2021-35587, which impacts Oracle Fusion Middleware.\n\n\n\nSecurityWeek has reached out to Oracle for comment in light of this new evidence and will update the article as soon as the company responds.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cisco Confirms Authenticity of Data After Second Leak\nRelated: OpenAI Finds No Evidence of Breach After Hacker Offers to Sell 20 Million Credentials\nRelated: HPE Says Personal Information Stolen in 2023 Russian Hack\n\nA hacker named ‘rose87168’ announced recently on a hacking forum the sale of data associated with over 140,000 Oracle Cloud tenants.

        "Content": "A threat actor operating under the alias “rose87168” has allegedly breached Oracle Cloud, claiming to have stolen approximately 6 million sensitive records, including encrypted passwords, authentication data, and key files. The claims were made in a post on a dark web forum.\nThe threat actor is allegedly offering the stolen data for sale and has reportedly attempted to extort affected organizations. While Oracle has officially denied any breach, cybersecurity researchers and the threat actor’s own posts suggest that unauthorized access may have occurred, potentially affecting over 140,000 Oracle Cloud tenants worldwide.\nThe threat actor claims to have exfiltrated the following sensitive information from Oracle Cloud:\nJava KeyStore (JKS) files\nEncrypted Single Sign-On (SSO) passwords\nEncrypted Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) passwords\nEnterprise Manager JPS keys\nA sample data shared by rose87168:\nIf verified, these records could be critical for authentication and security within Oracle Cloud systems.\nDisputed Claims and Oracle’s Denial\nDespite the threat actor’s claims, Oracle has categorically denied that its cloud systems were compromised. The company maintains that no Oracle Cloud customer data was stolen and that the leaked credentials are unrelated to its services.\nTags:\nCloud\nCloud security\nconsumer data\ncorporate data\noracle\nPersonal Data\nrose87168"
