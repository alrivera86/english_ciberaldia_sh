        "Content": "YouTube videos promoting game cheats are being used to deliver a previously undocumented stealer malware called\nArcane\nlikely targeting Russian-speaking users.\n\"What's intriguing about this malware is how much it collects,\" Kaspersky\nsaid\nin an analysis. \"It grabs account information from VPN and gaming clients, and all kinds of network utilities like ngrok, Playit, Cyberduck, FileZilla, and DynDNS.\"\nThe attack chains involve sharing links to a password-protected archive on YouTube videos, which, when opened, unpacks a start.bat batch file that's responsible for retrieving another archive file via PowerShell.\nThe batch file then utilizes PowerShell to launch two executables embedded within the newly downloaded archive, while also disabling Windows SmartScreen protections and every drive root folder to SmartScreen filter exceptions.\nOf the two binaries, one is a cryptocurrency miner and the other is a stealer dubbed VGS that's a variant of the\nPhemedrone\nStealer malware. As of November 2024, the attacks have been found to replace VGS with Arcane.\n\"Although much of it was borrowed from other stealers, we could not attribute it to any of the known families,\" the Russian cybersecurity company noted.\nBesides stealing login credentials, passwords, credit card data, and cookies from various Chromium- and Gecko-based browsers, Arcane is equipped to harvest comprehensive system data as well as configuration files, settings, and account information from several apps such as follows -\nVPN clients: OpenVPN, Mullvad, NordVPN, IPVanish, Surfshark, Proton, hidemy.name, PIA, CyberGhost, and ExpressVPN\nNetwork clients and utilities: ngrok, Playit, Cyberduck, FileZilla, and DynDNS\nMessaging apps: ICQ, Tox, Skype, Pidgin, Signal, Element, Discord, Telegram, Jabber, and Viber\nEmail clients: Microsoft Outlook\nGaming clients and services: Riot Client, Epic, Steam, Ubisoft Connect (ex-Uplay), Roblox, Battle.net, and various Minecraft clients\nCrypto wallets: Zcash, Armory, Bytecoin, Jaxx, Exodus, Ethereum, Electrum, Atomic, Guarda, and Coinomi\nFurthermore, Arcane is designed to take screenshots of the infected device, enumerate running processes, and list saved Wi-Fi networks and their passwords.\n\"Most browsers generate unique keys for encrypting sensitive data they store, such as logins, passwords, cookies, etc.,\" Kaspersky said. \"Arcane uses the Data Protection API (DPAPI) to obtain these keys, which is typical of stealers.\"\n\"But Arcane also contains an executable file of the Xaitax utility, which it uses to crack browser keys. To do this, the utility is dropped to disk and launched covertly, and the stealer obtains all the keys it needs from its console output.\"\nAdding to its capabilities, the stealer malware implements a separate method for extracting cookies from Chromium-based browsers launching a copy of the browser through a debug port.\nThe unidentified threat actors behind the operation have since expanded their offerings to include a loader named ArcanaLoader that's ostensibly meant to download game cheats, but delivers the stealer malware instead. Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan have emerged as the primary targets of the campaign.\n\"What's interesting about this particular campaign is that it illustrates how flexible cybercriminals are, always updating their tools and the methods of distributing them,\" Kasperksy said. \"Besides, the Arcane stealer itself is fascinating because of all the different data it collects and the tricks it uses to extract the information the attackers want.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Cybersecurity isn't just another checkbox on your business agenda. It's a fundamental pillar of survival. As organizations increasingly migrate their operations to the cloud, understanding how to protect your digital assets becomes crucial. The\nshared responsibility model\n, exemplified through Microsoft 365's approach, offers a framework for comprehending and implementing effective cybersecurity measures.\nThe Essence of Shared Responsibility\nThink of cloud security like a well-maintained building: the property manager handles structural integrity and common areas, while tenants secure their individual units. Similarly, the shared responsibility model creates a clear division of security duties between cloud providers and their users. This partnership approach ensures comprehensive protection through clearly defined roles and responsibilities.\nWhat Your Cloud Provider Handles\nMicrosoft maintains comprehensive responsibility for securing the foundational elements of your cloud environment. Their security team manages physical infrastructure security, including state-of-the-art data centers and robust network architecture. They implement platform-level security features and regularly deploy security updates to protect against emerging threats. Your data receives protection through sophisticated encryption protocols, both during transmission and while stored. Microsoft also ensures compliance with global security standards and regulations, conducts regular security audits, and employs advanced threat detection capabilities with rapid response protocols.\nYour Business's Security Responsibilities\nAs a Microsoft 365 user, your organization must take ownership of several critical security aspects. This includes implementing robust user access controls and choosing appropriate authentication methods for your security needs. Your team should carefully configure security\nsettings to align with your organization's risk tolerance and compliance requirements. Protecting account credentials and maintaining strong password policies falls squarely within your domain. Additionally, you must actively monitor and control data sharing practices, ensure comprehensive employee security training, and determine when additional security tools are necessary to meet specific business requirements.\nDiscover how CrashPlan enhances\nMicrosoft 365 backup and recovery here\n.\nImplementing Security Measures\nBegin your security journey with a comprehensive assessment of your current security posture using\nMicrosoft Secure Score\n. This evaluation will reveal existing security gaps that require immediate attention. Based on these findings, develop a detailed remediation plan with clear priorities and timelines. Establish a dedicated security governance team to oversee the implementation process and create effective communication channels for security-related updates and concerns.\nAuthentication and Access Management Implementation\nThe implementation of robust authentication measures begins with enabling Security Defaults in Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). Create a pilot program starting with your IT staff to test and refine the deployment process. When configuring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) methods, prioritize the use of authenticator apps, Google Authenticator or Duo, over SMS for enhanced security. Develop comprehensive end-user training materials and communication plans to ensure smooth adoption.\nYour MFA rollout should follow a phased approach, beginning with IT and administrative staff to build internal expertise. Next, extend implementation to department managers who can champion the change within their teams. Follow this with a controlled rollout to general staff members, and finally include external contractors in your MFA requirements.\nFor Role Based Access Control (RBAC), start by documenting your organization's existing roles and responsibilities in detail. Create role groups that align with specific job functions, beginning with Global Administrators, who should be limited to two or three trusted individuals. Define clear responsibilities for Security Administrators, Compliance Administrators, and Department-level Administrators. Implement the principle of least privilege access for each role, ensuring users have only the permissions necessary for their job functions.\nData Protection Configuration\nBegin your data protection journey by conducting a thorough assessment of your organization's information assets. Identify and categorize sensitive data types across your systems, paying particular attention to Personal Identifiable Information (PII), financial records, intellectual\nproperty, and client confidential information. These classifications form the foundation of your data protection strategy.\nCreate a hierarchical system of sensitivity labels that reflects your organization's data handling requirements. Start with basic classifications such as Public for generally available information, and progress through Internal for company-wide data, Confidential for sensitive business information, and Highly Confidential for the most critical data assets. Implement auto-labeling policies to automatically classify common data types, reducing the burden on end users while ensuring consistent protection.\nYour\nData Loss Prevention\n(DLP) implementation should begin with enabling Microsoft 365's built-in policies that align with common regulatory requirements. Develop custom DLP policies that address your organization's specific needs, configured to monitor critical business locations including email communications, Teams conversations, and SharePoint document libraries. Create clear notification templates that explain policy violations to users and provide guidance on proper data handling.\nIn addition to these measures, a\n3-2-1 backup strategy\nis crucial for ensuring the recovery of your organization's data in case of an incident or disaster. This involves maintaining three copies of your data (primary, secondary, and tertiary), on two different types of media (such as hard drives and tape drives), with one being offsite. Implementing a 3-2-1 backup strategy ensures that you can recover your data in the event of a disaster, reducing downtime and minimizing potential losses.\nThreat Protection Setup\nConfigure Microsoft Defender's Safe Links feature to provide comprehensive protection against malicious URLs. Enable real-time URL scanning across all Office applications and remove the option for users to click through warnings, ensuring consistent protection. Set up Safe Links to scan URLs at the time of click, providing protection even against delayed-action threats.\nImplement Safe Attachments with Dynamic Delivery to maintain productivity while ensuring document safety. Configure the system to block detected malware and extend protection across SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams environments. Enhance your anti-phishing defenses by creating targeted protection for high-risk users such as executives and finance team members.\nEstablish a comprehensive security monitoring framework beginning with carefully calibrated alert notifications. Define clear severity thresholds that align with your incident response capabilities and ensure notifications reach the appropriate team members. Create an escalation procedure that accounts for alert severity and response time requirements.\nOngoing Security Management\nImplement a structured approach to security maintenance through a weekly rotation of key tasks. The first week of each month should focus on comprehensive access reviews, ensuring appropriate permissions across all systems. Week two centers on evaluating policy effectiveness and making necessary adjustments. The third week involves detailed compliance verification against relevant standards and regulations. Complete the monthly cycle with a thorough review of security metrics and performance indicators.\nEstablish a comprehensive security training program that addresses different audience needs throughout the month. Begin with new employee security orientation sessions that cover fundamental security practices and company policies. Follow this with department-specific training that addresses unique security challenges and requirements for different business units. Conduct regular phishing simulation exercises to test and improve user awareness.\nLooking Ahead\nOrganizations must maintain strong security which requires constant vigilance and adaptation. Organizations must stay informed about emerging threats and security technologies while regularly assessing and updating their security controls. Success in cybersecurity isn't measured by the absence of incidents but by the effectiveness of your detection and response capabilities.\nRemember that implementing security measures is an ongoing journey rather than a destination. Regular assessment, continuous improvement, and active engagement from all stakeholders are essential for maintaining an effective security posture in today's dynamic threat landscape.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

The attacks were disrupted in December 2024.\nTargets of these attacks included individuals spread across over two dozen countries, including several in Europe such as Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.\n\"This is the latest example of why spyware companies must be held accountable for their unlawful actions,\" a WhatsApp spokesperson told The Hacker News at that time. \"WhatsApp will continue to protect peoples' ability to communicate privately.\"\nIn these attacks, targets were added to a WhatsApp group, and then sent a PDF document, which is subsequently parsed automatically to trigger the now-patched zero-day vulnerability and load the Graphite spyware. The final stage entails escaping the Android sandbox to compromise other apps on the targeted devices.\nFurther investigation of hacked Android devices has uncovered a forensic artifact dubbed BIGPRETZEL that is suspected to uniquely identify infections with Paragon' Graphite spyware.\nEvidence has also found evidence of a likely Paragon infection targeting an iPhone belonging to an Italy-based founder of the organization Refugees in Libya in June 2024. Apple has since addressed the attack vector with the release of iOS 18.\n\"Mercenary spyware attacks like this one are extremely sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals because of who they are or what they do,\" Apple said in a statement.\n\"After detecting the attacks in question, our security teams rapidly developed and deployed a fix in the initial release of iOS 18 to protect iPhone users, and sent Apple threat notifications to inform and assist users who may have been individually targeted.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Regulatory compliance is no longer just a concern for large enterprises. Small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) are increasingly subject to strict data protection and security regulations, such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, CMMC, GDPR, and the FTC Safeguards Rule. However, many SMBs struggle to maintain compliance due to limited IT resources, evolving regulatory requirements, and complex security challenges.\nRecent data shows there are approximately 33.3 million SMBs in the U.S., and 60% or more are not fully compliant with at least one regulatory standard. That means nearly 20 million SMBs could be at risk of fines, security breaches, and reputational damage.\nFor Managed Service Providers (MSPs), this presents a huge opportunity to expand your service offerings by providing continuous compliance monitoring—helping your clients stay compliant while strengthening their own business.\nThe Role of Continuous Compliance Monitoring\nTraditional compliance audits have been conducted periodically—often annually or quarterly. However, this approach leaves gaps where security threats and compliance violations can go unnoticed.\nContinuous compliance monitoring provides real-time visibility into security, data protection, and regulatory adherence. This proactive approach allows MSPs to:\nDetect compliance issues as they happen rather than waiting for an annual audit.\nAutomate reporting and documentation, reducing manual labor.\nReduce the risk of costly penalties by addressing compliance gaps before they become violations.\nWith the right tools in place, MSPs can transform compliance from a time-consuming, labor-intensive headache into a scalable, profitable service.\nValue to MSP Clients: Why Businesses Need Continuous Compliance Monitoring\nFor SMBs, the benefits of compliance monitoring go far beyond avoiding fines. A proactive compliance strategy can help businesses:\nMinimize the Risk of Fines and Legal Penalties:\nRegulatory fines can range from thousands to millions of dollars. Continuous compliance monitoring helps businesses avoid these costly penalties.\nEnhance Security and Data Protection:\nNon-compliance often correlates with weak cybersecurity practices. A compliance monitoring solution helps businesses detect vulnerabilities before they lead to a data breach.\nStreamline Audit Readiness:\nPreparing for an audit can take weeks or months. Automated compliance reports eliminate the last-minute scramble, ensuring businesses are always audit-ready.\nStrengthen Business Reputation and Customer Trust:\nConsumers and partners are more likely to work with businesses that demonstrate a strong commitment to compliance and data security.\nHow Compliance Manager GRC Turns Compliance into a Scalable MSP Service\nFor many MSPs, managing compliance manually is complex, overwhelming and unprofitable.

It is widely used by software and web developers, data scientists, and programmers.\nReversingLabs discovered that the two extensions contain a PowerShell command that downloads and executes another PS script that acts as ransomware from a remote server hosted on Amazon AWS.\nThe ransomware is clearly in development or a test as it only encrypts files in the C:\\users\\%username%\\Desktop\\testShiba folder and does not touch any other files.\nWhen done encrypting the files, the script will display a Windows alert stating, \"Your files have been encrypted. Pay 1 ShibaCoin to ShibaWallet to recover them.\" No ransom notes or further instructions are given like normal ransomware attacks.\nMalicious PowerShell script\nSource: ReversingLabs\nReversingLabs states that Microsoft quickly removed the two extensions from the VSCode Marketplace after the researchers reported them.\nHowever, ExtensionTotal security researcher Italy Kruk told BleepingComputer that their automated scanner caught the extensions earlier and informed Microsoft a while back, receiving no response.\nKruk explains that ahban.cychelloworld wasn't malicious in its initial upload. It added the ransomware code in its second submission, version 0.0.2, which was accepted on the VSCode Marketplace on November 24, 2024.\n\"We reported ahban.cychelloworld to Microsoft on November 25, 2024, via an automatic report generated by our scanner,\" Kruk told BleepingComputer.\n\"It is possible that due to the low number of installs for the offending extension, Microsoft didn't prioritize its review.\"\nSince then, the ahban.cychelloworld extension had another five releases, all containing the malicious code and all being accepted in Microsoft's store.\nThe fact that the extensions downloaded and executed remote PowerShell scripts, and could stay undetected for almost four months demonstrates a concerning gap in Microsoft's review process.\nAlthough in this case, Microsoft failed to react for months, the company has done the opposite recently,\nremoving VSCode themes used by 9 million users\ntoo quickly after it got reported for suspicious obfuscated code.\nWhile VSCode themes should not be using obfuscated JavaScript, the Material Theme – Free' and 'Material Theme Icons – Free' extensions were later proven not to be malicious.\nMicrosoft\napologized\nfor the unjustified removal and banning of their publisher and said they would update their \"scanners and investigation process to reduce the likelihood of another event like this.\"\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft apologizes for removing VSCode extensions used by millions\nVSCode extensions with 9 million installs pulled over security risks\nMicrosoft: North Korean hackers join Qilin ransomware gang\nNew Microsoft script updates Windows media with bootkit malware fixes\nRansomHub ransomware uses new Betruger ‘multi-function’ backdoor"

It will also serve to highlight the real security risks of falling behind.\n\"Quantum computing is set to revolutionize technology, but it also poses significant risks to current encryption methods,\"\nstated NCSC's CTO, Ollie Whitehouse\n.\n\"Our new guidance on post-quantum cryptography provides a clear roadmap for organizations to safeguard their data against these future threats, helping to ensure that today's confidential information remains secure in years to come.\n\"As quantum technology advances, upgrading our collective security is not just important – it's essential.\"\nThe NCSC's PQC migration guidance primarily impacts government agencies, large enterprises, critical national infrastructure operators, as well as technology and software providers with bespoke IT systems that rely on cryptography.\nThe\nmigration timeline\ndefined by NCSC's latest guidance is the following:\nBy 2028, organizations must define their migration goals, conduct a full discovery and assessment of their cryptographic dependencies, and develop an initial migration plan.\nBy 2031, organizations should complete their highest-priority PQC migration activities, ensure their infrastructure is ready for a post-quantum future, and refine their migration plan to provide a clear roadmap for full implementation.\nBy 2035, organizations must have completed migration to PQC across all systems, services, and products.\nThe NCSC recommends adopting\nNIST-approved PQC algorithms\nfor migration, which were standardized by the U.S. organization last year, and are expected to become the foundation for post-quantum security globally.\nThese algorithms are ML-KEM (FIPS 203), ML-DSA (FIPS 204), and SLH-DSA (FIPS 205). Earlier this month, NIST also\nannounced that HQC\nwas its officially selected backup algorithm for post-quantum encryption.\nThe UK organization acknowledged the numerous challenges that arise from such a migration, including legacy systems that cannot be moved to the post-quantum age, lack of in-house expertise, and supply chain complexities.\nThe NCSC says it will soon launch a pilot scheme aimed at connecting cryptography specialists with UK organizations migrating to PQC to assist them with asset discovery, assessment, and planning.\nThe\nUnited States\nhas established a similar timeline for migrating to PQC through the National Security Memorandum 10 (\nNSM-10\n), which also\nsets 2035\nas the target year for completing the transition across federal systems.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nGoogle Cloud introduces quantum-safe digital signatures in KMS\nUK watchdog probes TikTok and Reddit over child privacy concerns\nApple pulls iCloud end-to-end encryption feature in the UK\nCyber agencies share security guidance for network edge devices"

Exploiting the flaw could allow attackers to include arbitrary files via manipulated URL paths.\nThe flaw is triggered only if WP Ghost's \"Change Paths\" feature is set to Lite or Ghost mode. Although these modes are not enabled by default, Patchstack notes that the Local File Inclusion (LFI) part applies to nearly all setups.\n\"The vulnerability occurred due to insufficient user input value via the URL path that will be included as a file,\"\nreads Patchstack's report\n.\n\"Due to the behavior of the LFI case, this vulnerability could lead to Remote Code Execution on almost all of the environment setup.\"\nHence, the vulnerability allows LFI universally, but whether it escalates to RCE depends on the specific server configuration.\nLFI without RCE can still be dangerous through scenarios such as information disclosure, session hijacking, log poisoning, access to source code, and denial of service (DoS) attacks.\nFollowing the discovery of the flaw by researcher Dimas Maulana on February 25, 2025, Patchstack analyzed it internally and eventually notified the vendor on March 3.\nOn the next day, the developers of WP Ghost incorporated a fix in the form of an additional validation on the supplied URL or path from the users.\nThe patch was incorporated on WP Ghost version 5.4.02, while version 5.4.03 has also been made available in the meantime.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to either version to mitigate CVE-2025-26909.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nCritical RCE flaw in Apache Tomcat actively exploited in attacks\nCritical PHP RCE vulnerability mass exploited in new attacks\nIvanti fixes three critical flaws in Connect Secure & Policy Secure\nOver 12,000 KerioControl firewalls exposed to exploited RCE flaw\nHackers exploit Cityworks RCE bug to breach Microsoft IIS servers"

But while that may be valuable for compliance purposes, these kinds of point-in-time assessments simply don’t align with modern development practices and cybersecurity requirements:\nWith each code iteration, security snapshots lose relevance\nPatch verification stalls until the next scheduled assessment window\nDevelopment teams get large batches of findings rather than actionable, real-time feedback\nLimited tester and retesting availability creates bottlenecks in security testing\nCommunication barriers between developers and testers slow down remediation to a crawl\nContinuous testing for modern development\nPenetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS) offers a more flexible approach that better aligns with rapid development cycles. Rather than treating security testing as an annual event, PTaaS integrates continuous assessment throughout the development process:\nReal-time vulnerability reporting lets you take immediate action on critical issues\nDevelopers and testers can directly communicate, speeding up remediation\nUnlimited retesting lets you verify fixes without waiting for the next assessment cycle\nHaving access to diverse tester expertise ensures comprehensive security coverage and could even eliminate the need for vendor rotation\nHybrid approach combines the best of both automated scanning as well as manual testing expertise to cover all possible vulnerability sources\nBeyond just finding vulnerabilities\nFinding vulnerabilities is only half the battle — rapid remediation requires that security teams partner closely with developers. PTaaS platforms facilitate this collaboration by:\nProviding instant notification when it discovers new vulnerabilities\nOffering built-in communication channels for clarifying findings and discussing fixes\nGiving rapid feedback on proposed remediation approaches\nProviding contextual guidance to help developers understand and prevent similar issues\nTracking progress with metrics that demonstrate security improvements\nMaking the transition\nSwitching from yearly to continuous assessment demands new approaches to security integration and team coordination. Organizations need to break down silos between security, development, and operations teams while establishing new workflows that support rapid identification and remediation of vulnerabilities.\nTo successfully transition, understand where your traditional pen testing falls short. Your security teams should examine their current testing processes, identifying bottlenecks in vulnerability reporting, delays in remediation verification, and gaps in coverage between scheduled assessments.\nThen, extend your success metrics beyond compliance considerations to include practical measures like mean time to remediate vulnerabilities, reduction in high-severity findings over time, and improvements in early-stage vulnerability detection. You should also consider how quickly development teams can receive and act on critical security findings.\nChoosing a platform\nChoosing the right platform is also important. Select a solution that integrates with existing development tools and ticketing systems. Look for platforms that offer real-time dashboards, automated scanning capabilities, and direct communication channels between developers and security testers.\nOutpost24 dashboard\nAs you transition to continuous penetration testing, remember that the goal isn't just to find vulnerabilities —it's to build a more resilient security program that integrates with your organization’s rapid development cycle to keep business critical assets safe without slowing you down.\nMaintaining compliance while improving security\nRather than choosing between compliance and security, PTaaS solutions offer your organization the best of both worlds. With comprehensive documentation of testing activities and regular status reports, you can go beyond checking compliance boxes, providing substantially better security coverage.\nPTaaS-Solutions like\nthose from Outpost24\ninclude built-in audit trails that capture vulnerability discovery and remediation efforts, while performing continual assessment that lets you define (and track) ongoing security requirements.\nOrganizations ready to move beyond pentesting for just compliance reasons should explore how continuous penetration testing through PTaaS can strengthen their application security program.

        "Content": "Swiss global solutions provider Ascom has confirmed a cyberattack on its IT infrastructure as a hacker group known as Hellcat targets Jira servers worldwide using compromised credentials.\nThe company announced in a press release that hackers on Sunday breached its technical ticketing system and is currently investigating the incident.\nAscom is a telecommunications company with subsidiaries in 18 countries focusing on wireless on-site communications.\nHellCat hacking group claimed the attack and told BleepingComputer that they stole about 44GB of data that may impact all of the company’s divisions.\nAscom says that the hackers compromised its technical ticketing system, the incident had no impact on the company’s business operations, and that customers and partners do not need to take any preventive action.\n“Investigations against such criminal offenses were initiated immediately and are ongoing. Ascom is working closely with the relevant authorities” -\nAscom\nRey, a member of the HellCat hacking group, told BleepingComputer that they stole from Ascom source code for multiple products, details about various projects, invoices, confidential documents, and issues from the ticketing system.\nThe Swiss company did not provide technical details about the breach but targeting the Jira ticketing system has become a common attack method for the HellCat hackers.\nHellCat on a Jira hacking spree\nJira is a project management and issue-tracking platform commonly used by software developers and IT teams to track and manage projects. The platform often contains sensitive data, such as source code, authentication keys, IT plans, customer information, and internal discussions related to these projects.\nPrevious incidents claimed by HellCat and confirmed by the targeted companies count\nSchneider Electric\n,\nTelefónica\n, and\nOrange Group\n, and in all three instances the hackers breached their way in through Jira servers.\nRecently, the same hackers also took responsibility for an attack on the British multinational car maker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and stole and leaked about 700 internal documents.\nAs the threat actor describes it, the leak includes “development logs, tracking data, source codes” and an employee’s data that exposed “sensitive information such as username, email, display name, timezone, and more.”\nHellCat ransowmare claims Jaguar Land Rover breach\nAlon Gal\n, co-founder and CTO at threat intelligence company Hudson Rock, says the JLR breach follows a pattern specific to HellCat hackers.\n“At the heart of this latest incident lies a technique that has become HELLCAT’s signature: exploiting Jira credentials harvested from compromised employees that were infected by Infostealers” -\nAlon Gal\nThe researcher said that the JLR incident was possible by using the credentials of an LG Electronics employee with third-party credentials to JLR’s Jira server.\nGal highlights that the compromised credentials were not fresh and had been exposed for several years but remained valid all this time, allowing hackers to take advantage.\nHellCat’s activity didn’t stop at these breaches as the threat actor announced today that they compromised the Jira system of Affinitiv, a marketing company that provides data analytics a platform for OEMs and dealerships in the automotive industry.\nThe threat actor confirmed to BleepingComputer that they breached Affinitiv through a Jira system and disclosed publicly that they stole a database with a little over 470,000 “unique emails” and more than 780,000 records.\nWhen contacted by BleepingComputer about the alleged attack, Affinitiv said that they had begun an investigation.\nTo prove the breach, hackers published two screenshots with names, email addresses, postal addresses, and dealership names.\nAlon Gal is warning that Jira “has become a prime target for attackers due to its centrality in enterprise workflows and the wealth of data it houses” and this type of access can be used to “move laterally, escalate privileges, and extract sensitive information.”\nAs credentials collected by infostealers are easy to find and given that some of them remain unchanged for years as companies fail to include them in a regular rotation process, such attacks will likely become more frequent.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nPennsylvania education union data breach hit 500,000 people\nOrange Group confirms breach after hacker leaks company documents\nDutch Police seizes 127 XHost servers, dismantles bulletproof hoster\nUnitedHealth now says 190 million impacted by 2024 data breach\nRansomHub ransomware uses new Betruger ‘multi-function’ backdoor"

        "Date": "2025-03-20",
        "Content": "A message posted on Monday to the homepage of the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is the latest exhibit in the Trump administration’s continued disregard for basic cybersecurity protections. The message instructed recently-fired CISA employees to get in touch so they can be rehired and then immediately placed on leave, asking employees to send their Social Security number or date of birth in a password-protected email attachment — presumably with the password needed to view the file included in the body of the email.\nThe homepage of cisa.gov as it appeared on Monday and Tuesday afternoon.\nOn March 13, a Maryland district court judge ordered the Trump administration to reinstate more than 130 probationary CISA employees who were fired last month. On Monday, the administration announced that those dismissed employees would be reinstated but placed on paid administrative leave. They are among nearly 25,000 fired federal workers who are in the process of being rehired.\nA notice covering the CISA homepage said the administration is making every effort to contact those who were unlawfully fired in mid-February.\n“Please provide a password protected attachment that provides your full name, your dates of employment (including date of termination), and one other identifying factor such as date of birth or social security number,” the message reads. “Please, to the extent that it is available, attach any termination notice.”\nThe message didn’t specify how affected CISA employees should share the password for any attached files, so the implicit expectation is that employees should just include the plaintext password in their message.\nEmail is about as secure as a postcard sent through the mail, because anyone who manages to intercept the missive anywhere along its path of delivery can likely read it. In security terms, that’s the equivalent of encrypting sensitive data while also attaching the secret key needed to view the information.\nWhat’s more, a great many antivirus and security scanners have trouble inspecting password-protected files, meaning the administration’s instructions are likely to increase the risk that malware submitted by cybercriminals could be accepted and opened by U.S. government employees.\nThe message in the screenshot above was removed from the CISA homepage Tuesday evening and replaced with a much shorter notice directing former CISA employees to contact a specific email address. But a slightly different version of the same message originally posted to CISA’s website still exists at the website for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which likewise instructs those fired employees who wish to be rehired and put on leave to send a password-protected email attachment with sensitive personal data.\nA message from the White House to fired federal employees at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services instructs recipients to email personal information in a password-protected attachment.\nThis is hardly the first example of the administration discarding Security 101 practices in the name of expediency. Last month, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) sent an unencrypted email to the White House with the first names and first letter of the last names of recently hired CIA officers who might be easy to fire.\nAs cybersecurity journalist Shane Harris noted in The Atlantic, even those fragments of information could be useful to foreign spies.\n“Over the weekend, a former senior CIA official showed me the steps by which a foreign adversary who knew only his first name and last initial could have managed to identify him from the single line of the congressional record where his full name was published more than 20 years ago, when he became a member of the Foreign Service,” Harris wrote. “The former official was undercover at the time as a State Department employee. If a foreign government had known even part of his name from a list of confirmed CIA officers, his cover would have been blown.”\nThe White House has also fired at least 100 intelligence staffers from the National Security Agency (NSA), reportedly for using an internal NSA chat tool to discuss their personal lives and politics. Testifying before the House Select Committee on the Communist Party earlier this month, the NSA’s former top cybersecurity official said the Trump administration’s attempts to mass fire probationary federal employees will be “devastating” to U.S. cybersecurity operations.\nRob Joyce, who spent 34 years at the NSA, told Congress how important those employees are in sustaining an aggressive stance against China in cyberspace.\n“At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,” Joyce told the panel. “Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.”\nBoth the message to fired CISA workers and DOGE’s ongoing efforts to bypass vetted government networks for a faster Wi-Fi signal are emblematic of this administration’s overall approach to even basic security measures: To go around them, or just pretend they don’t exist for a good reason.\nOn Monday, The New York Times reported that U.S. Secret Service agents at the White House were briefly on alert last month when a trusted captain of Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) visited the roof of the Eisenhower building inside the White House compound — to see about setting up a dish to receive satellite Internet access directly from Musk’s Starlink service.\nThe White House press secretary told The Times that Starlink had “donated” the service and that the gift had been vetted by the lawyer overseeing ethics issues in the White House Counsel’s Office. The White House claims the service is necessary because its wireless network is too slow.\nJake Williams, vice president for research and development at the cybersecurity consulting firm Hunter Strategy, told The Times “it’s super rare” to install Starlink or another internet provider as a replacement for existing government infrastructure that has been vetted and secured.\n“I can’t think of a time that I have heard of that,” Williams said. “It introduces another attack point,” Williams said. “But why introduce that risk?”\nMeanwhile, NBC News reported on March 7 that Starlink is expanding its footprint across the federal government.\n“Multiple federal agencies are exploring the idea of adopting SpaceX’s Starlink for internet access — and at least one agency, the General Services Administration (GSA), has done so at the request of Musk’s staff, according to someone who worked at the GSA last month and is familiar with its network operations — despite a vow by Musk and Trump to slash the overall federal budget,” NBC wrote.\nThe longtime Musk employee who encountered the Secret Service on the roof in the White House complex was Christopher Stanley, the 33-year-old senior director for security engineering at X and principal security engineer at SpaceX.\nOn Monday, Bloomberg broke the news that Stanley had been tapped for a seat on the board of directors at the mortgage giant Fannie Mae. Stanley was added to the board alongside newly confirmed Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte, the grandson of the late housing businessman and founder of PulteGroup — William J. Pulte.\nIn a nod to his new board role atop an agency that helps drive the nation’s $12 trillion mortgage market, Stanley retweeted a Bloomberg story about the hire with a smiley emoji and the comment “Tech Support.”\n\nBut earlier today, Bloomberg reported that Stanley had abruptly resigned from the Fannie board, and that details about the reason for his quick departure weren’t immediately clear. As first reported here last month, Stanley had a brush with celebrity on Twitter in 2015 when he leaked the user database for the DDoS-for-hire service LizardStresser, and soon faced threats of physical violence against his family.\nMy 2015 story on that leak did not name Stanley, but he exposed himself as the source by posting a video about it on his Youtube channel. A review of domain names registered by Stanley shows he went by the nickname “enKrypt,” and was the former owner of a pirated software and hacking forum called error33[.]net, as well as theC0re, a video game cheating community.\nStanley is one of more than 50 DOGE workers, mostly young men and women who have worked with one or more of Musk’s companies. The Trump administration remains dogged by questions about how many — if any — of the DOGE workers were put through the gauntlet of a thorough security background investigation before being given access to such sensitive government databases.\nThat’s largely because in one of his first executive actions after being sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, President Trump declared that the security clearance process was simply too onerous and time-consuming, and that anyone so designated by the White House counsel would have full top secret/sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI) clearances for up to six months. Translation: We accepted the risk, so TAH-DAH! No risk!\nPresumably, this is the same counsel who saw no ethical concerns with Musk “donating” Starlink to the White House, or with President Trump summoning the media to film him hawking Cybertrucks and Teslas (a.k.a. “Teslers”) on the White House lawn last week.\nMr. Musk’s unelected role as head of an ad hoc executive entity that is gleefully firing federal workers and feeding federal agencies into “the wood chipper” has seen his Tesla stock price plunge in recent weeks, while firebombings and other vandalism attacks on property carrying the Tesla logo are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas and driving down Tesla sales.\nPresident Trump and his attorney general Pam Bondi have dubiously asserted that those responsible for attacks on Tesla dealerships are committing “domestic terrorism,” and that vandals will be prosecuted accordingly. But it’s not clear this administration would recognize a real domestic security threat if it was ensconced squarely behind the Resolute Desk.\nOr at the pinnacle of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Washington Post reported last month that Trump’s new FBI director Kash Patel was paid $25,000 last year by a film company owned by a dual U.S. Russian citizen that has made programs promoting “deep state” conspiracy theories pushed by the Kremlin.\n“The resulting six-part documentary appeared on Tucker Carlson’s online network, itself a reliable conduit for Kremlin propaganda,” The Post reported. “In the film, Patel made his now infamous pledge to shut down the FBI’s headquarters in Washington and ‘open it up as a museum to the deep state.'”\nWhen the head of the FBI is promising to turn his own agency headquarters into a mocking public exhibit on the U.S. National Mall, it may seem silly to fuss over the White House’s clumsy and insulting instructions to former employees they unlawfully fired.\nIndeed, one consistent feedback I’ve heard from a subset of readers here is something to this effect: “I used to like reading your stuff more when you weren’t writing about politics all the time.”\nMy response to that is: “Yeah, me too.” It’s not that I’m suddenly interested in writing about political matters; it’s that various actions by this administration keep intruding on my areas of coverage.\nA less charitable interpretation of that reader comment is that anyone still giving such feedback is either dangerously uninformed, being disingenuous, or just doesn’t want to keep being reminded that they’re on the side of the villains, despite all the evidence showing it.\nArticle II of the U.S. Constitution unambiguously states that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. But almost from Day One of his second term, Mr. Trump has been acting in violation of his sworn duty as president by choosing not to enforce laws passed by Congress (TikTok ban, anyone?), by freezing funds already allocated by Congress, and most recently by flouting a federal court order while simultaneously calling for the impeachment of the judge who issued it. Sworn to uphold, protect and defend The Constitution, President Trump appears to be creating new constitutional challenges with almost each passing day.\nWhen Mr. Trump was voted out of office in November 2020, he turned to baseless claims of widespread “election fraud” to explain his loss — with deadly and long-lasting consequences. This time around, the rallying cry of DOGE and White House is “government fraud,” which gives the administration a certain amount of cover for its actions among a base of voters that has long sought to shrink the size and cost of government.\nIn reality, “government fraud” has become a term of derision and public scorn applied to anything or anyone the current administration doesn’t like. If DOGE and the White House were truly interested in trimming government waste, fraud and abuse, they could scarcely do better than consult the inspectors general fighting it at various federal agencies.\nAfter all, the inspectors general likely know exactly where a great deal of the federal government’s fiscal skeletons are buried. Instead, Mr. Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general, leaving the government without critical oversight of agency activities. That action is unlikely to stem government fraud; if anything, it will only encourage such activity.\nAs Techdirt founder Mike Masnick noted in a recent column “Why Techdirt is Now a Democracy Blog (Whether We Like it or Not),” when the very institutions that made American innovation possible are being systematically dismantled, it’s not a “political” story anymore: It’s a story about whether the environment that enabled all the other stories we cover will continue to exist.\n“This is why tech journalism’s perspective is so crucial right now,” Masnick wrote. “We’ve spent decades documenting how technology and entrepreneurship can either strengthen or undermine democratic institutions. We understand the dangers of concentrated power in the digital age. And we’ve watched in real-time as tech leaders who once championed innovation and openness now actively work to consolidate control and dismantle the very systems that enabled their success.”\n“But right now, the story that matters most is how the dismantling of American institutions threatens everything else we cover,” Masnick continued. “When the fundamental structures that enable innovation, protect civil liberties, and foster open dialogue are under attack, every other tech policy story becomes secondary.”\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Wednesday 19th of March 2025 09:26 PM \r\n         \napologizes for double posting, but glad to see so many positive comments supporting Brian and his story.\nFor those honest folks who have followed this cybernews blog over a long period of time and have faith\nin Brian’s dedication and integrity, I think you all know that anyone who goes to extreme invective, posts\ninflammatory remarks, starts using fowl language to foment an emotional response, and in any other way\nseeks to drag down or make the conversation heated is an enemy of respectful discourse.   This site has always\nbeen for me a place of good info, subtle humor, even respectful fellowship of the professionals who usually come here.\nI hope it will continue to represent decent, hard working Americans who wish only the best for their nation, and\nspecifically the health of our cyber infrastructure.   I am only a wannabe computer professional, never was willing\nto give the kind of effort, focus, and discipline that it demands, but I can see there is a bigger game afoot, and I hope\neveryone stays on their guard against it.\nAs you say Brian, your blog is not normally about politics – it’s CyberSecurity. And politics are now ripping the complete guts out of the USA’s CyberSecurity, for starters.\nI have been shaking my head in disbelief, watching all of this in the media. I mean: fire all the people who are responsible for dealing with taking apart old nuclear warheads? What’re they going to do with them, put the old and dodgy (DOGE?) stuff in the corner of a warehouse and let it irradiate everything? Chuck it in a hole or drain somewhere in the backwoods of nowhere? I’m halfway expecting it to be put up on eBay for cash because the US government is now too broke because everyone who checks that taxes have been paid has been fired…tax dodgers (DOGERS!) rejoice!\nI now understand why people have a fascination with watching/talking about what amounts to trainwrecks. This is probably the biggest trainwreck in history, an entire nation voluntarily dismantling itself. It makes the mental disconnect of the UK’s NCSC saying “go to post-quantum encryption by 2035!” and the UK’s government saying to Apple “build in a back door and shaddup about it” extremely small beer.\nYou wouldn’t read about this in The Onion and the old Mad Magazine. Simply because neither were creative enough to imagine this type of lunacy happening.\nBack in a minute, I need more popcorn. I have a Trainwreck™ to watch, unfolding live.\nLove having an illegal immigrant nepo baby + nazi getting to act as an unelected beaurocrat and mass fire people as a non existent government entity. Very frustrating how cult members cannot think about or challenge anything the Trump regime does, no matter how abhorrent. Thank you Brian for ignoring these hateful people and continuing God’s work. You’re a fantastic journalist and investigator.\nKeep up your good reporting!\nAre the us intelligence/security agencies ever going to be trustworthy again? I feel that it’s going to be impossible to certify that any technology that they use will be safe from intrusion with so many untrustworthy technical people having access right now.\nNot real clear why a password protected attachment is needed for any of that info (‘cept SSN# which seems to be optional…) Very strange request.  (And “password protected” doesn’t always mean encrypted… sometimes it’s only enforced by client app)  Provide the termination notice?  Don’t they know who they terminated?  \n…and then if you don’t want to be reinstated “please provide a written statement as quickly as possible”.  What??!  Provide a written statement to who? where?  And what kind of idiot wouldn’t want to be paid while on administrative leave?\nYour email address will not be published.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nAnalysis reveals a 140% increase in browser phishing, including a 130% increase in zero-hour phishing attacks.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nBrowser security cannot be ignored. It’s where people spend most of their working day, and it’s where attackers focus most of their attacks.\nStatistics come from Menlo Security’s analysis of 750,000 browser-based phishing attacks targeting more than 800 entities detected over the last 12 months. This analysis reveals a 140% increase in browser phishing, including a 130% increase in zero-hour phishing attacks (effectively, a zero-day attack applied to phishing).\n\n\n\nThe reasons for the growth are multiple: our growing reliance on the browser for much of our daily work, the prevalence of zero-day vulnerabilities, the increasing sophistication of the cybercriminal underworld, and, worryingly, the growing influence of gen-AI. Gen-AI is particularly concerning, both for its use today and its potential use in the future.\n\n\n\n“Threat actors have advanced in speed and skills. They are using the same tools and infrastructure as professional engineers,” comments Andrew Harding, VP of security strategy at Menlo Security. “We’re seeing a dangerous combination of zero-day attacks, advanced social engineering techniques, sophisticated phishing techniques, and readily available phishing-as-a-service kits, all designed to infiltrate systems and steal valuable data.”\n\n\n\nHe adds, “This trend is only poised to escalate dramatically in 2025 as attackers adopt AI to increase both scale and effectiveness.”\n\n\n\nThe relevance of gen-AI is complex. It is used by criminals to create compelling phishing sites, it is used as a lure offering fake AI services, and it is used to create and scale sophisticated phishing attacks.\n\n\n\n“It’s very difficult for end users to identify these browser-based phishing attacks since they are mostly using trusted services,” warns Thomas Richards, red team practice director at Black Duck. “Before proceeding with account creation, or entering credentials on an unknown website, it’s best to do some research to ensure that it is the original website and not a forgery.”\n\n\n\nMenlo’s report (PDF) says the firm detected nearly 600 incidents with imposter sites passing themselves off as gen-AI sites offering fake AI services. Gen-AI is used by criminals to create compelling deepfakes and to research individual targets for more efficient phishing. This will only increase in the future. Advertisement.

Harding notes that the fake gen-AI sites trick people into entering personal data for the purpose, perhaps, of generating a resume. “The returned document is typically a PDF,” he explains, “where malware can hide out and be delivered.” Gen-AI is, in short, beginning to allow criminals to skip the credential theft stage of an attack and go straight to the common final stage – the delivery of ransomware in an expected PDF.\n\n\n\n“Attackers will continue exploiting trusted platforms and using gen-AI to create more convincing phishing campaigns at unprecedented scale,” adds Stephen Kowski, field CTO at SlashNext. “The combination of speed, creativity, and automation will make these threats particularly challenging.”\n\n\n\nThis is especially relevant to the use of browsers on mobile devices. “Combining these capabilities with the form factor or mobile browsers, with their limited URL visibility and reliance on auto-login features, provides the perfect storm for attackers to steal credentials without raising suspicion,” explains Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP of product strategy at Zimperium.\n\n\n\nMenlo also comments on the growing use of phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) and expects this to increase. PhaaS is not solely a browser-based problem. Separately, a report from Barracuda published on the same day as Menlo’s browser-specific report (March 19, 2025) notes, “The first few months of 2025 saw a massive spike in phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) attacks targeting organizations around the world, with more than a million attacks detected by Barracuda systems in January and February.” It adds that Tycoon 2FA was the most prominent PhaaS platform, accounting for 89% of the incidents seen in January.\n\n\n\n“The integration of AI and large language models (LLMs) into these cybercrime services will further enhance the scale and automation of attacks, enabling cybercriminals to leverage sophisticated browser-based phishing techniques and automated social media reconnaissance for more effective phishing campaigns,” says Menlo.\n\t\t\t\nStatistics come from Menlo Security’s analysis of 750,000 browser-based phishing attacks targeting more than 800 entities detected over the last 12 months.

Separately, a report from Barracuda published on the same day as Menlo’s browser-specific report (March 19, 2025) notes, “The first few months of 2025 saw a massive spike in phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) attacks targeting organizations around the world, with more than a million attacks detected by Barracuda systems in January and February.” It adds that Tycoon 2FA was the most prominent PhaaS platform, accounting for 89% of the incidents seen in January.\n\n\n\n“The integration of AI and large language models (LLMs) into these cybercrime services will further enhance the scale and automation of attacks, enabling cybercriminals to leverage sophisticated browser-based phishing techniques and automated social media reconnaissance for more effective phishing campaigns,” says Menlo.\n\t\t\t\n“Attackers will continue exploiting trusted platforms and using gen-AI to create more convincing phishing campaigns at unprecedented scale,” adds Stephen Kowski, field CTO at SlashNext. “The combination of speed, creativity, and automation will make these threats particularly challenging.”\n\n\n\nThis is especially relevant to the use of browsers on mobile devices. “Combining these capabilities with the form factor or mobile browsers, with their limited URL visibility and reliance on auto-login features, provides the perfect storm for attackers to steal credentials without raising suspicion,” explains Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP of product strategy at Zimperium.\n\n\n\nMenlo also comments on the growing use of phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) and expects this to increase.

Exploiting this vulnerability could expose sensitive data, including configuration files, backups, and credentials, potentially leading to data breaches or further security compromises,” Nakivo notes in its advisory.\n\n\n\nIn late February, cybersecurity firm watchTowr, which reported the flaw, published a technical report explaining how it found the bug and how it allowed them to access any file on the server and to obtain the credentials used by Nakivo’s backup and disaster recovery solution.\n\n\n\nBecause the product supports a broad range of integrations within an organization’s environment, including cloud services, the flaw could potentially allow an attacker to unlock “entire infrastructure environments”, watchTowr says.\n\n\n\nThe cybersecurity firm reported the flaw in September 2024 and received confirmation on the bug in late October.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nA Joni Mitchell song from the 1960s can teach us a lot about securing hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nWhen I was six years old, my parents bought a car that had a cassette player in it. From that moment began years of listening to my parents’ 60s music during car rides. To say that those artists and songs had an impact on me and the way I view the world would be an understatement.\nWhen my father passed in June, 2023, it catalyzed quite a bit of thinking, analysis, and introspection, as one might imagine it would. Some of what I reviewed in my mind were the artists and songs featured during all of those car rides. It turns out that one artist, in particular, had written a song whose lyrics would inspire my keynote at the 2024 FS-ISAC Fall Summit.\n\n\n\nThat keynote was entitled, “What Joni Mitchell Can Teach Us About Our Security Journey”. You may be asking yourself what exactly Joni Mitchell has to do with security at all and what might have inspired me? Well, as it turns out, quite a bit more than you might initially expect.\n\n\n\nTo understand where I’m going with this, let’s begin by analyzing the first three stanzas of Joni Mitchell’s famous song “Both Sides Now”:\n\n\n\nStanza 1:\nRows and floes of angel hair\n\n\n\nAnd ice cream castles in the air\n\n\n\nAnd feather canyons everywhereAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nI’ve looked at clouds that way\n\n\n\nIn this first stanza, Joni describes a naive, innocent, blissful way of looking at clouds.  This is reminiscent of the way in which many people viewed the cloud 15-20 years ago.  The prevailing wisdom at the time was that everything would move to the cloud, and that the cloud would be the solution to many of the technology and security problems that plagued us at the time.  Indeed, time has shown that to be a very naive, innocent, and blissful way of looking at the cloud.\n\n\n\nStanza 2:\nBut now they only block the sun\n\n\n\nThey rain and snow on everyone\n\n\n\nSo many things I would have done\n\n\n\nBut clouds got in my way\n\n\n\nIn the second stanza, Joni’s approach to clouds has changed quite a bit.  She now describes negative experiences and effects that result from clouds.  This is similar to the way in which many people view the cloud today.  The reality that most enterprises find themselves in is one of hybrid and multi-cloud environments.  The environments are extremely complex and bring with them increased risk, lack of telemetry/visibility, and lack of agility.  It is a much darker, but perhaps more sober way of looking at the cloud.\n\n\n\nStanza 3:\nI’ve looked at clouds from both sides now\n\n\n\nFrom up and down, and still somehow\n\n\n\nIt’s cloud illusions I recall\n\n\n\nI really don’t know clouds at all\n\n\n\nIn the third stanza, we see a more balanced approach to clouds that would appear to result from a bit of a life journey. Indeed, Joni seems to describe that clouds are in fact neither all good nor all bad. They are, like most things in life, complex. Further, Joni highlights that we can’t really know clouds, but rather, we can merely see one or more perspectives or vantage points that we can observe and internalize.\n\n\n\nTo me, this seems like where our thinking as a security field is headed as it relates to the cloud. The cloud brings with it plenty of advantages, while at the same time, it brings many challenges.  It is a complex entity, neither all good nor all bad.  Our experience with the cloud is a journey, just as Joni’s experience with physical clouds is a journey.  If we embrace this complexity and this journey, we just might be able to change the way we approach security challenges and make new progress towards solving some of the chronic problems we face as a community.\n\n\n\nJoni then goes on to describe this journey as it relates to love and life in the remaining six stanzas of the song, but that analysis is beyond the scope of this article. “Both Sides Now” is a great song – I highly recommend giving it a listen.\n\n\n\nComing back to our topic, given that security in modern infrastructures is a journey, and that it is okay for hybrid and multi-cloud environments to be complex, multi-dimensional, and make us a bit uncomfortable at times, let’s have a look at some data from F5’s 2024 State of Application Strategy report to understand a bit about the impact the cloud has had:\n\n\n\n\nThe average financial company manages 601 APIs\n88% of organizations operate in two or more environments\n38% of organizations operate in six or more environments\n56% of organizations make app-by-app deployment decisions\n67% of app services are deployed in the cloud\n\nBuilding on this insight, what lessons can we learn from Joni Mitchell and apply to our security programs? This is an important question, since due to business drivers around cost, innovation, remaining competitive, and speed to market, hybrid and multi-cloud environments are not going anywhere any time soon.\n\n\n\nThere are likely many lessons we can learn from Joni’s poetic lyrics, but here are a few:\n\n\n\n\nTake inspiration and lessons from various places: There are a lot of lessons that the world around us can teach us.  We just need to open our eyes and minds and take it all in.  We need to find inspiration in the analog world and apply it to security problems.\nLeverage the wisdom of other professions and genres: Most professions have been around far longer than the security profession.  It would be foolish of us to think that we can’t learn a thing or two from those professions.  After all, they’ve likely solved a few important problems during the course of their existence.\nIt is okay to be moved and motivated by poetry: There is no shame in being moved by art, music, literature, and/or poetry.  There are great works out there that people have created through inspiration, hard work, and dedication.  Surely we can learn a thing or two from that in the security field.\nEmbrace the cloud security journey as a good thing: Looking at cloud security as a journey is a good thing.  That allows us to apply fresh thinking and new perspectives to hopefully address some of the persistent challenges that have been plaguing us as a field.\nFocus on the business angle and on being a partner: Security cannot be the Department of “No”.  We need to understand the priorities, issues, and challenges the business faces.  We need to build a partnership with the business to facilitate the business running profitably, effectively, and securely.\nRealize that we really don’t know clouds at all: As with most things in life, the cloud is sufficiently complex and multi-dimensional.  We’re not going to be able to get to a ground truth, full understanding of the modern enterprise environment.  Instead, we’ll have to take various perspectives and vantage points and base our decisions off them.  As we do this, however, it is important to remember that we will never have a complete view, and as a result, we may encounter data from time to time that informs us that we need to course correct.\n\nA Joni Mitchell song from the 1960s may initially seem like an odd place to find inspiration for security challenges. After coming along on this journey with me, however, I hope you’ll agree that Joni can teach us a lot about securing hybrid and multi-cloud environments. One thing is for sure – we need to expand beyond the conventional wisdom to effectively tackle some of today’s most pressing security challenges.\n\t\t\t\nWhen my father passed in June, 2023, it catalyzed quite a bit of thinking, analysis, and introspection, as one might imagine it would.

One thing is for sure – we need to expand beyond the conventional wisdom to effectively tackle some of today’s most pressing security challenges.\n\t\t\t\nThat keynote was entitled, “What Joni Mitchell Can Teach Us About Our Security Journey”. You may be asking yourself what exactly Joni Mitchell has to do with security at all and what might have inspired me? Well, as it turns out, quite a bit more than you might initially expect.\n\n\n\nTo understand where I’m going with this, let’s begin by analyzing the first three stanzas of Joni Mitchell’s famous song “Both Sides Now”:\n\n\n\nStanza 1:\nRows and floes of angel hair\n\n\n\nAnd ice cream castles in the air\n\n\n\nAnd feather canyons everywhereAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nI’ve looked at clouds that way\n\n\n\nIn this first stanza, Joni describes a naive, innocent, blissful way of looking at clouds.  This is reminiscent of the way in which many people viewed the cloud 15-20 years ago.  The prevailing wisdom at the time was that everything would move to the cloud, and that the cloud would be the solution to many of the technology and security problems that plagued us at the time.  Indeed, time has shown that to be a very naive, innocent, and blissful way of looking at the cloud.\n\n\n\nStanza 2:\nBut now they only block the sun\n\n\n\nThey rain and snow on everyone\n\n\n\nSo many things I would have done\n\n\n\nBut clouds got in my way\n\n\n\nIn the second stanza, Joni’s approach to clouds has changed quite a bit.  She now describes negative experiences and effects that result from clouds.  This is similar to the way in which many people view the cloud today.  The reality that most enterprises find themselves in is one of hybrid and multi-cloud environments.  The environments are extremely complex and bring with them increased risk, lack of telemetry/visibility, and lack of agility.  It is a much darker, but perhaps more sober way of looking at the cloud.\n\n\n\nStanza 3:\nI’ve looked at clouds from both sides now\n\n\n\nFrom up and down, and still somehow\n\n\n\nIt’s cloud illusions I recall\n\n\n\nI really don’t know clouds at all\n\n\n\nIn the third stanza, we see a more balanced approach to clouds that would appear to result from a bit of a life journey. Indeed, Joni seems to describe that clouds are in fact neither all good nor all bad. They are, like most things in life, complex. Further, Joni highlights that we can’t really know clouds, but rather, we can merely see one or more perspectives or vantage points that we can observe and internalize.\n\n\n\nTo me, this seems like where our thinking as a security field is headed as it relates to the cloud. The cloud brings with it plenty of advantages, while at the same time, it brings many challenges.  It is a complex entity, neither all good nor all bad.  Our experience with the cloud is a journey, just as Joni’s experience with physical clouds is a journey.  If we embrace this complexity and this journey, we just might be able to change the way we approach security challenges and make new progress towards solving some of the chronic problems we face as a community.\n\n\n\nJoni then goes on to describe this journey as it relates to love and life in the remaining six stanzas of the song, but that analysis is beyond the scope of this article. “Both Sides Now” is a great song – I highly recommend giving it a listen.\n\n\n\nComing back to our topic, given that security in modern infrastructures is a journey, and that it is okay for hybrid and multi-cloud environments to be complex, multi-dimensional, and make us a bit uncomfortable at times, let’s have a look at some data from F5’s 2024 State of Application Strategy report to understand a bit about the impact the cloud has had:\n\n\n\n\nThe average financial company manages 601 APIs\n88% of organizations operate in two or more environments\n38% of organizations operate in six or more environments\n56% of organizations make app-by-app deployment decisions\n67% of app services are deployed in the cloud\n\nBuilding on this insight, what lessons can we learn from Joni Mitchell and apply to our security programs? This is an important question, since due to business drivers around cost, innovation, remaining competitive, and speed to market, hybrid and multi-cloud environments are not going anywhere any time soon.\n\n\n\nThere are likely many lessons we can learn from Joni’s poetic lyrics, but here are a few:\n\n\n\n\nTake inspiration and lessons from various places: There are a lot of lessons that the world around us can teach us.  We just need to open our eyes and minds and take it all in.  We need to find inspiration in the analog world and apply it to security problems.\nLeverage the wisdom of other professions and genres: Most professions have been around far longer than the security profession.  It would be foolish of us to think that we can’t learn a thing or two from those professions.  After all, they’ve likely solved a few important problems during the course of their existence.\nIt is okay to be moved and motivated by poetry: There is no shame in being moved by art, music, literature, and/or poetry.  There are great works out there that people have created through inspiration, hard work, and dedication.  Surely we can learn a thing or two from that in the security field.\nEmbrace the cloud security journey as a good thing: Looking at cloud security as a journey is a good thing.  That allows us to apply fresh thinking and new perspectives to hopefully address some of the persistent challenges that have been plaguing us as a field.\nFocus on the business angle and on being a partner: Security cannot be the Department of “No”.  We need to understand the priorities, issues, and challenges the business faces.  We need to build a partnership with the business to facilitate the business running profitably, effectively, and securely.\nRealize that we really don’t know clouds at all: As with most things in life, the cloud is sufficiently complex and multi-dimensional.  We’re not going to be able to get to a ground truth, full understanding of the modern enterprise environment.  Instead, we’ll have to take various perspectives and vantage points and base our decisions off them.  As we do this, however, it is important to remember that we will never have a complete view, and as a result, we may encounter data from time to time that informs us that we need to course correct.\n\nA Joni Mitchell song

clouds are in fact neither all good nor all bad. They are, like most things in life, complex. Further, Joni highlights that we can’t really know clouds, but rather, we can merely see one or more perspectives or vantage points that we can observe and internalize.\n\n\n\nTo me, this seems like where our thinking as a security field is headed as it relates to the cloud. The cloud brings with it plenty of advantages, while at the same time, it brings many challenges.  It is a complex entity, neither all good nor all bad.  Our experience with the cloud is a journey, just as Joni’s experience with physical clouds is a journey.  If we embrace this complexity and this journey, we just might be able to change the way we approach security challenges and make new progress towards solving some of the chronic problems we face as a community.\n\n\n\nJoni then goes on to describe this journey as it relates to love and life in the remaining six stanzas of the song, but that analysis is beyond

that it is okay for hybrid and multi-cloud environments to be complex, multi-dimensional, and make us a bit uncomfortable at times, let’s have a look at some data from F5’s 2024 State of Application

think that we can’t learn a thing or two from those professions.  After all, they’ve likely solved a few important problems during the course of their existence.\nIt is okay to be moved and motivated by poetry: There is no shame in being moved by art, music, literature, and/or poetry.  There are great works out there that people have created through inspiration, hard work, and dedication.  Surely we can learn a thing or two from that in the security field.\nEmbrace the cloud security journey as a good thing: Looking at cloud security as a journey is a good thing.  That allows us to apply fresh thinking and new perspectives to hopefully address some of the persistent challenges that have been plaguing us as a field.\nFocus on the business angle and on being a partner: Security cannot be the Department of “No”.  We need to understand the priorities, issues, and challenges the business faces.  We need to build a partnership with the business to facilitate the business running profitably, effectively, and securely.\nRealize that we really don’t know clouds at all: As with most things in life, the cloud is sufficiently complex and multi-dimensional.  We’re not going to be able to get to a ground truth, full understanding of the modern enterprise environment.  Instead, we’ll have to take various perspectives and vantage points and base our decisions off them.  As we do this, however, it is important to remember that we will never have a complete view, and as a result, we may encounter data from time to time that informs us that we need to course correct.\n\nA Joni Mitchell song

from that in the security field.\nEmbrace the cloud security journey as a good thing: Looking at cloud security as a journey is a good thing.  That allows us to apply fresh thinking and new perspectives to hopefully address some of the persistent challenges that have been plaguing us as a field.\nFocus on the business angle and on being a partner: Security cannot be the Department of “No”.  We need to understand the priorities, issues, and challenges the business faces.  We need to build a partnership with the business to facilitate the business running profitably, effectively, and securely.\nRealize that we really don’t know clouds at all: As with most things in life, the cloud is sufficiently complex and multi-dimensional.  We’re not going to be able to get to a ground truth, full understanding of the modern enterprise environment.  Instead, we’ll have to take various perspectives and vantage points and base our decisions off them.  As we do this, however, it is important to remember that we will never have a complete view, and as a result, we may encounter data from time to time that informs us that we need to course correct.\n\nA Joni Mitchell song from the 1960s may initially seem like an odd place to find inspiration for security challenges. After coming along on this journey with me, however, I hope you’ll agree that Joni can teach us a lot about securing hybrid and multi-cloud environments. One thing is for sure – we need to expand beyond the conventional wisdom to effectively tackle some of today’s most pressing security challenges.\n\t\t\t\nSo many things I would have done\n\n\n\nBut clouds got in my way\n\n\n\nIn the second stanza, Joni’s approach to clouds has changed quite a bit.  She now describes negative experiences and effects that result from clouds.  This is similar to the way in which many people view the cloud today.  The reality that most enterprises find themselves in is one of hybrid and multi-cloud environments.  The environments are extremely complex and bring with them increased risk, lack of telemetry/visibility, and lack of agility.  It is a much darker, but perhaps more sober way of looking at the cloud.\n\n\n\nStanza 3:\nI’ve looked at clouds from both sides now\n\n\n\nFrom up and down, and still somehow\n\n\n\nIt’s cloud illusions I recall\n\n\n\nI really don’t know clouds at all\n\n\n\nIn the third stanza, we see a more balanced approach to clouds that would appear to result from a bit of a life journey. Indeed, Joni seems to describe that clouds are in fact neither all good nor all bad. They are, like most things in life, complex. Further, Joni highlights that we can’t really know clouds, but rather, we can merely see one or more perspectives or vantage points that we can observe and internalize.\n\n\n\nTo me, this seems like where our thinking as a security field is headed as it relates to the cloud. The cloud brings with it plenty of advantages, while at the same time, it brings many challenges.  It is a complex entity, neither all good nor all bad.  Our experience with the cloud is a journey, just as Joni’s experience with physical clouds is a journey.  If we embrace this complexity and this journey, we just might be able to change the way we approach security challenges and make new progress towards solving some of the chronic problems we face as a community.\n\n\n\nJoni then goes on to describe this journey as it relates to love and life in the remaining six stanzas of the song, but that analysis is beyond the scope of this article. “Both Sides Now” is a great song – I highly recommend giving it a listen.\n\n\n\nComing back to our topic, given that security in modern infrastructures is a journey, and that it is okay for hybrid and multi-cloud environments to be complex, multi-dimensional, and make us a bit uncomfortable at times, let’s have a look at some data from F5’s 2024 State of Application Strategy report to understand a bit about the impact the cloud has had:\n\n\n\n\nThe average financial company manages 601 APIs\n88% of organizations operate in two or more environments\n38% of organizations operate in six or more environments\n56% of organizations make app-by-app deployment decisions\n67% of app services are deployed in the cloud\n\nBuilding on this insight, what lessons can we learn from Joni Mitchell and apply to our security programs? This is an important question, since due to business drivers around cost, innovation, remaining competitive, and speed to market, hybrid and multi-cloud environments are not going anywhere any time soon.\n\n\n\nThere are likely many lessons we can learn from Joni’s poetic lyrics, but here are a few:\n\n\n\n\nTake inspiration and lessons from various places: There are a lot of lessons that the world around us can teach us.  We just need to open our eyes and minds and take it all in.  We need to find inspiration in the analog world and apply it to security problems.\nLeverage the wisdom of other professions and genres: Most professions have been around far longer than the security profession.  It would be foolish of us to think that we can’t learn a thing or two from those professions.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nVeeam has released patches for a critical-severity remote code execution vulnerability in Backup & Replication.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nBackup, recovery, and data protection firm Veeam on Wednesday announced patches for a critical-severity vulnerability in its Backup & Replication product that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely.\nIn a scarce advisory, Veeam notes that the security defect, tracked as CVE-2025-23120 (CVSS score of 9.9), could allow for “remote code execution (RCE) by authenticated domain users”, and that Backup & Replication version 12.3.0.310 and previous version 12 builds are affected.\n\n\n\nThe company recommends updating to Backup & Replication version 12.3.1 (build 12.3.1.1139), which includes patches for the flaw.\n\n\n\nAccording to cybersecurity firm watchTowr, which was credited for reporting the vulnerability, CVE-2025-23120 is rooted in a broader issue within Veeam’s deserialization mechanism, which the company has failed to properly address.\n\n\n\nVeeam Backup & Replication, watchTowr says, follows the industry standard of controlling which classes can be deserialized, by implementing an allow-list, but also fails to implement proper deserialization procedures, as one of the allowed classes leads to inner deserialization, which implements a block-list instead.\n\n\n\nVeeam’s patches for previously reported deserialization flaws involved adding entries to the block-list, and, due to this configuration and Backup & Replication’s large codebase, new deserialization gadgets that can be exploited to achieve code execution can still be found, watchTowr says.\n\n\n\nCVE-2025-23120, the cybersecurity firm explains, can be linked to CVE-2024-40711, a critical-severity RCE flaw disclosed in September 2024 and exploited in ransomware attacks less than a month later.\n\n\n\nIt can also be linked to CVE-2024-42455, a high-severity bug allowing “an authenticated user with a role assigned in the Users and Roles settings on the backup server to connect to remote services and exploit insecure deserialization by sending a serialized temporary file collection, thereby enabling the deletion of any file on the system with service account privileges”.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nEssentially, watchTowr says, an attacker can identify this type of issues in Backup & Replication by searching the product’s codebase for deserialization gadgets that are not block-listed, and which could have a malicious impact.\n\n\n\nThe cybersecurity firm itself identified two such issues (collectively tracked as CVE-2025-23120), including one that can be exploited by modifying proof-of-concept (PoC) code targeting CVE-2024-40711.\n\n\n\nwatchTowr also warns that, while the exploitation of the new vulnerability requires for the attacker to be logged in, “the authentication requirement is fairly weak.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Veeam Warns of Critical Vulnerability in Service Provider Console\nRelated: Veeam Patches High-Severity Vulnerability as Exploitation of Previous Flaw Expands\nRelated: Year-Old Veeam Vulnerability Exploited in Fresh Ransomware Attacks\nRelated: Critical Veeam Vulnerability Leads to Authentication Bypass\n\nIn a scarce advisory, Veeam notes that the security defect, tracked as CVE-2025-23120 (CVSS score of 9.9), could allow for “remote code execution (RCE) by authenticated domain users”, and that Backup & Replication version 12.3.0.310 and previous version 12 builds are affected.\n\n\n\nThe company recommends updating to Backup & Replication version 12.3.1 (build 12.3.1.1139), which includes patches for the flaw.\n\n\n\nAccording to cybersecurity firm watchTowr, which was credited for reporting the vulnerability, CVE-2025-23120 is rooted in a broader issue within Veeam’s deserialization mechanism, which the company has failed to properly address.\n\n\n\nVeeam Backup & Replication, watchTowr says, follows the industry standard of controlling which classes can be deserialized, by implementing an allow-list, but also fails to implement proper deserialization procedures, as one of the allowed classes leads to inner deserialization, which implements a block-list instead.\n\n\n\nVeeam’s patches for previously reported deserialization flaws involved adding entries to the block-list, and, due to this configuration and Backup & Replication’s large codebase, new deserialization gadgets that can be exploited to achieve code execution can still be found, watchTowr says.\n\n\n\nCVE-2025-23120, the cybersecurity firm explains, can be linked to CVE-2024-40711, a critical-severity RCE flaw disclosed in September 2024 and exploited in ransomware attacks less than a month later.\n\n\n\nIt can also be linked to CVE-2024-42455, a high-severity bug allowing “an authenticated user with a role assigned in the Users and Roles settings on the backup server to connect to remote services and exploit insecure deserialization by sending a serialized temporary file collection, thereby enabling the deletion of any file on the system with service account privileges”.Advertisement.

The networking giant at the time announced the availability of patches. \n\n\n\nAccording to Cisco, the flaws, tracked as CVE-2024-20439 and CVE-2024-20440, can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to collect sensitive information or manage associated services on a system where the software is running. \n\n\n\nTechnical details describing CVE-2024-20439 were made public a few weeks later after a researcher reverse engineered Cisco’s patches. \n\n\n\nSANS’s Johannes Ullrich on Wednesday reported seeing in-the-wild attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nThe researcher explained that CVE-2024-20439 is a ‘backdoor’ allowing access to the software through a hardcoded password. CVE-2024-20440 is related to a log file that “logs more than it should” and which can be accessed following the exploitation of the first vulnerability.\n\n\n\nIn the attacks observed by SANS honeypots, the attacker has attempted to use the default credentials to access Cisco Smart Licensing Utility instances. \n\n\n\nIt’s unclear what the attackers are after, but Ullrich pointed out that the same threat actor is apparently also trying to hack other types of systems, including what seem to be internet-exposed IoT devices. Advertisement.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nAttacks involving Paragon’s Graphite spyware involved a WhatsApp zero-day that could be exploited without any user interaction.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThe Citizen Lab research group at the University of Toronto has conducted an analysis of attacks involving spyware developed by Israeli company Paragon Solutions, which led to the discovery of a zero-day vulnerability in Meta’s WhatsApp communications application.\nParagon has been around since 2019 and its spyware is called Graphite. The company claims that — unlike NSO Group and other surveillance firms whose solutions have been used by authoritarian regimes to target activists, politicians and journalists — it has safeguards in place to prevent such abuse.\n\n\n\nCitizen Lab has found evidence of Graphite use in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Singapore, Israel and Cyprus. There is some indication that the spyware has been used by police in Canada.\n\n\n\nThe Graphite spyware made headlines recently over its use against people in Italy, including against Android and iPhone device users. The Italian government in February denied spying on journalists and migrant activists with the Paragon spyware.\n\n\n\nMeta recently warned 90 users across two dozen countries that they had been targeted with Paragon spyware over WhatsApp. \n\n\n\nAt least some of these attacks involved exploitation of a WhatsApp zero-day that did not require any user interaction, according to Citizen Lab.\n\n\n\n“We shared details about our mapping of Paragon’s infrastructure with Meta, because we believed that WhatsApp might be used as an infection vector. Meta told us that these details were pivotal to their ongoing investigation into Paragon. Meta shared information with WhatsApp that led them to identify, mitigate, and attribute a Paragon zero-click exploit,” Citizen Lab said.\n\n\n\nWhatsApp exploits, particularly zero-click exploits, can be highly valuable. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nWhatsApp has not released an advisory for the vulnerability and does not appear to have assigned a CVE identifier, which indicates that the zero-day was likely fixed on the server side and users do not need to take any action.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of a zero-day vulnerability, WhatsApp confirmed to Citizen Lab that an Android component tracked as BigPretzel, which has been involved in attacks targeting its users, is also associated with Paragon. \n\n\n\nCitizen Lab noted that the recently uncovered evidence seems to contradict Paragon’s claims regarding the types of entities targeted with its solutions.\n\n\n\n“The 90-some targets notified by WhatsApp likely represent a fraction of the total number of Paragon cases. Yet, in the cases already investigated, there is a troubling and familiar pattern of targeting human rights groups, government critics, and journalists,” Citizen Lab said.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: WhatsApp representatives told SecurityWeek they were able to address the vulnerability — which they describe as an ‘attack vector’ — late last year, without the need for a client-side fix. The attacks involved using groups and sending a PDF file.\n\n\n\nRelated: Apple Ships iOS 18.3.2 to Fix Already-Exploited WebKit Flaw\nRelated: NSO Group Used at Least 3 iOS Zero-Click Exploits in 2022: Citizen Lab\nRelated: North Korean Hackers Distributed Android Spyware via Google Play\n\nParagon has been around since 2019 and its spyware is called Graphite.
