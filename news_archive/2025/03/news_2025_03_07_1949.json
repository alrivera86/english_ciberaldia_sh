What we do know is that its developers are constantly adding new features, making it more modular and harder to detect.\"\nRagnar Loader, also referred to as Sardonic, was\nfirst documented\nby Bitdefender in August 2021 in connection with an unsuccessful attack carried out by FIN8 aimed at an unnamed financial institution located in the U.S. It's said to have been put to use since 2020.\nThen in July 2023, Broadcom-owned Symantec\nrevealed\nFIN8's use of an updated version of the backdoor to deliver the now-defunct BlackCat ransomware.\nThe core functionality of Ragnar Loader is its ability to establish long-term footholds within targeted environments, while employing an arsenal of techniques to sidestep detection and ensure operational resilience.\n\"The malware utilizes PowerShell-based payloads for execution, incorporates strong encryption and encoding methods (including RC4 and Base64) to conceal its operations, and employs sophisticated process injection strategies to establish and maintain stealthy control over compromised systems,\" PRODAFT noted.\n\"These features collectively enhance its ability to evade detection and persist within targeted environments.\"\nThe malware is offered to affiliates in the form of an archive file package containing multiple components to facilitate reverse shell, local privilege escalation, and remote desktop access. It's also designed to establish communications with the threat actor, allowing them to remotely control the infected system through a command-and-control (C2) panel.\nTypically executed on victim systems using PowerShell, Ragnar Loader integrates a bevy of anti-analysis techniques to resist detection and obscure control flow logic.\nFurthermore, it features the ability to conduct various backdoor operations by running DLL plugins and shellcode, as well as reading and exfiltrating the contents of arbitrary files. To enable lateral movement within a network, it makes use of another PowerShell-based pivoting file.\nAnother critical component is a Linux executable ELF file named bc that's designed to facilitate remote connections, permitting the adversary to launch an and execute command-line instructions directly on the compromised system.\n\"It employs advanced obfuscation, encryption, and anti-analysis techniques, including PowerShell-based payloads, RC4 and Base64 decryption routines, dynamic process injection, token manipulation, and lateral movement capabilities,\" PRODAFT said. \"These features exemplify the increasing complexity and adaptability of modern ransomware ecosystems.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Microsoft has disclosed details of a large-scale malvertising campaign that's estimated to have impacted over one million devices globally as part of what it said is an opportunistic attack designed to steal sensitive information.\nThe tech giant, which detected the activity in early December 2024, is tracking it under the broader umbrella Storm-0408, a moniker used for a set of threat actors that are known to distribute remote access or information-stealing malware via phishing, search engine optimization (SEO), or malvertising.\n\"The attack originated from illegal streaming websites embedded with malvertising redirectors, leading to an intermediary website where the user was then redirected to GitHub and two other platforms,\" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team\nsaid\n.\n\"The campaign impacted a wide range of organizations and industries, including both consumer and enterprise devices, highlighting the indiscriminate nature of the attack.\"\nThe most significant aspect of the campaign is the use of GitHub as a platform for delivering initial access payloads. In at least two other isolated instances, the payloads have been found hosted on Discord and Dropbox. The GitHub repositories have since been taken down. The company did not reveal how many such repositories were removed.\nThe Microsoft-owned code hosting service acts as a staging ground for dropper malware that's responsible for deploying a series of additional programs like Lumma Stealer and Doenerium, which, in turn, are capable of collecting system information.\nThe attack also employs a sophisticated redirection chain comprising four to five layers, with the initial redirector embedded within an iframe element on illegal streaming websites serving pirated content.\nThe overall infection sequence is a multi-stage process that involves system discovery, information gathering, and the use of follow-on payloads such as NetSupport RAT and AutoIT scripts to facilitate more data theft. The remote access trojan also serves as a conduit for stealer malware.\nFirst-stage - Establish a foothold on target devices\nSecond-stage - System reconnaissance, collection, and exfiltration, and payload delivery\nThird-stage - Command execution, payload delivery, defensive evasion, persistence, command-and-control communications, and data exfiltration\nFourth-stage - PowerShell script to configure Microsoft Defender exclusions and run commands to download data from a remote server\nAnother characteristic of the attacks concerns the use of various PowerShell scripts to download NetSupport RAT, identify installed applications and security software, specifically scanning for the presence of cryptocurrency wallets, indicating potential financial data theft.\n\"Besides the information stealers, PowerShell, JavaScript, VBScript, and AutoIT scripts were run on the host,\" Microsoft said. \"The threat actors incorporated use of living-off-the-land binaries and scripts (LOLBAS) like PowerShell.exe, MSBuild.exe, and RegAsm.exe for C2 and data exfiltration of user data and browser credentials.\"\nThe disclosure comes as Kaspersky revealed that bogus websites masquerading as the DeepSeek and Grok artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are being used to trick users into installing a previously undocumented Python information stealer.\nDeekSeek-themed decoy sites advertised by verified accounts on X (e.g., @ColeAddisonTech, @gaurdevang2, and @saduq5) have also been employed to execute a PowerShell script that uses SSH to grant attackers remote access to the computer.\n\"Cybercriminals use various schemes to lure victims to malicious resources,' the Russian cybersecurity company\nsaid\n. \"Typically, links to such sites are distributed through messengers and social networks. Attackers may also use typosquatting or purchase ad traffic to malicious sites through numerous affiliate programs.\"\nFound this article interesting?

PCI DSS v4 is coming, and businesses handling payment card data must be prepared.\nBeyond fines, non-compliance exposes businesses to\nweb skimming\n, third-party script attacks, and emerging browser-based threats.\nSo, how do you get ready in time?\nReflectiz sat down with Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F), for a no-holds-barred discussion about the toughest PCI DSS v4 challenges.\nKevin Heffernan, Director of Risk at A&F, shared actionable insights on:\nWhat worked (and saved $$$)\nWhat didn't (and cost time & resources)\nWhat they wish they had known earlier\n➡\nWatch the Full PCI DSS v4 Webinar Now\n(Free On-Demand Access – Learn from A&F's Compliance Experts)\nWhat's Changing in PCI DSS v4.0.1?\nPCI DSS v4 introduces stricter security standards—especially for third-party scripts, browser security, and continuous monitoring. Two of the biggest challenges for online merchants are requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1.\nRequirement 6.4.3 – Payment Page Script Security\nMost businesses rely on third-party scripts for checkout, analytics, live chat, and fraud detection. But attackers exploit these scripts to\ninject malicious code\ninto payment pages (Magecart-style attacks).\nNew PCI DSS v4 mandates:\nScript Inventory – Every script loaded in a user's browser must be logged and justified.\nIntegrity Controls – Businesses must verify the integrity of all payment page scripts.\nAuthorization – Only approved scripts should execute on checkout pages.\nHow A&F Tackled It:\nConducted script audits to identify unnecessary or risky third-party dependencies.\nUsed Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict third-party scripts.\nUtilized smart automated approvals to save time and money.\nRequirement 11.6.1 – Change & Tamper Detection\nEven if your scripts are secure today, attackers can inject malicious changes later.\nNew PCI DSS v4 mandates:\nMechanism - Continuous change and tamper detection mechanism deployment for payment page script changes.\nUnauthorised changes - HTTP header monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.\nIntegrity - Weekly integrity checks (or more frequently based on risk levels and indicators of compromise).\nHow A&F Tackled It:\nDeployed continuous monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.\nUsed Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for centralized monitoring.\nCreated automated alerts and batch-approval for script, structure and header changes on checkout pages.\nTry the Reflectiz PCI Dashboard – Free 30-Day Trial\nRecent Update: The SAQ A Exemption Clarification\nA recent clarification\nfrom the PCI council states the following regarding SAQ A marchants [self-assessment questionnaire]:\nEligibility Requirement\n: Merchants must confirm their site is not susceptible to script attacks affecting e-commerce systems.\nCompliance Options\n:\nImplement protection techniques (like those in PCI DSS Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1) either directly or through a third party\nOR obtain confirmation from PCI DSS-compliant service providers that their embedded payment solution includes script attack protection\nLimited Applicability\n: The criteria only applies to merchants using embedded payment pages/forms (e.g., iframes) from third-party service providers.\nExemptions\n: Merchants who redirect customers to payment processors or fully outsource payment functions are not subject to this requirement.\nRecommendations\n: Merchants should consult with their service providers about secure implementation and verify with their acquirer that SAQ A is appropriate for their environment.\nNote that even if you qualify for SAQ A, your entire website must still be secured. Many businesses will still need real-time monitoring and alerts, making full compliance solutions relevant regardless.\nA&F's Top 3 PCI DSS v4 Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)\nWith multiple payment pages to secure across the globe, Abercrombie and Fitch's compliance journey was complex. Kevin Heffernan, Director of Risk, has suggested three main mistakes that online merchants often make.\nMistake #1: Relying only on CSP\nWhile Content Security Policy (CSP) helps prevent script-based attacks, it doesn't cover dynamic changes in scripts or external resources. PCI DSS requires additional integrity verification.\nMistake #2: Ignoring Third-Party Vendors\nMost retailers rely on external payment gateways, chat widgets, and tracking scripts. If these vendors don't comply, you're still responsible. Regularly audit third-party integrations.\nMistake #3: Treating Compliance as a One-Time Fix\nPCI DSS v4 mandates ongoing monitoring—meaning you can't just audit scripts once and forget about it. Continuous monitoring solutions will be critical for compliance.\nTry the Reflectiz PCI Dashboard for 30 day free-trial.\nFinal Takeaways from A&F's PCI Compliance Journey\nRisk Assessment First\n– Identify and map vulnerabilities, supply chain risks, and components' misconfigurations before jumping into compliance changes.\nSecure Your Payment Page Scripts\n– Configure strict HTTP security headers, such as\nCSP\n.\nMonitor Continuously\n– Use continuous monitoring, SIEM, and tamper detection alerts to catch modifications before attackers exploit them.\nDon't Assume Vendors Have You Covered\n– Audit third-party scripts and integrations—compliance responsibility doesn't stop at your firewall.\nThe March 31st 2025 Deadline is Closer Than You Think\nWaiting too long to start\ncreates security gaps and risks costly fines\n. A&F's experience shows why\nearly preparation is critical\n.\n➡ Avoid Costly PCI Fines -\nWatch the PCI DSS v4 Webinar Now\nto learn how a major global retailer tackled compliance—and what you can do today to\navoid fines and security risks\n.\nTry the Reflectiz PCI Dashboard for 30 day free-trial.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

The project communicated with a domain \"getstockprice[.]com\" that was registered on Namecheap two days before.\nThis is prior evidence indicating that the TraderTraitor actors have tricked cryptocurrency exchange developers into helping troubleshoot a Docker project after approaching them via Telegram. The Docker project is configured to drop a next-stage payload named PLOTTWIST that enables persistent remote access.\nIt's not clear if the same modus operandi was employed in the latest attacks, as Safe{Wallet} said \"the attacker removed their malware and cleared Bash history in an effort to thwart investigative efforts.\"\nUltimately, the malware deployed to the workstation is said to have been utilized to conduct reconnaissance of the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment and hijack active AWS user sessions to perform their own actions aligning with the developer's schedule in an attempt to fly under the radar.\n\"The attacker use of Developer1's AWS account originated from ExpressVPN IP addresses with User-Agent strings containing distrib#kali.2024,\" it said. \"This User-Agent string indicates use of Kali Linux which is designed for offensive security practitioners.\"\nThe attackers have also been observed deploying the open-source\nMythic framework\n, as well as injecting malicious JavaScript code to the Safe{Wallet} website for a two-day period between February 19 and 21, 2025.\nBybit CEO Ben Zhou, in an\nupdate\nshared earlier this week, said over 77% of the stolen funds remain traceable, and that 20% have gone dark and 3% have been frozen. It credited 11 parties, including Mantle, Paraswap, and ZachXBT, for helping it freeze the assets. About 83% (417,348 ETH) has been converted into bitcoin, distributing it across 6,954 wallets.\nIn the wake of the hack, 2025 is on track for a record year for cryptocurrency heists, with Web3 projects already losing a staggering $1.6 billion in the first two months alone, an 8x increase from the $200 million this time last year, according to\ndata\nfrom blockchain security platform Immunefi.\n\"The recent attack underscores the evolving sophistication of threat actors and highlights\ncritical vulnerabilities in Web3 security\n,\" the company said.\n\"Verifying that the transaction you are signing will result in the intended outcome remains one of the biggest security challenges in Web3, and this is not just a user and education problem — it is an industry-wide issue that demands collective action.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Additional persistence is established via Windows Registry modifications, scheduled tasks, and bespoke services using the plugins of the Cobalt Strike kit called TaoWu.\n\"To maintain stealth, they erase event logs using wevtutil commands, removing traces of their actions from the Windows security, system, and application logs,\" Raghuprasad noted. \"Eventually, they execute Mimikatz commands to dump and exfiltrate passwords and NTLM hashes from memory on the victim's machine.\"\nThe attacks culminate with the hacking crew stealing passwords and NTLM hashes from the infected hosts. Further analysis of the command-and-control (C2) servers associated with the Cobalt Strike tool has revealed that the threat actor left the directory listings accessible over the internet, thereby exposing the full suite of adversarial tools and frameworks hosted on the Alibaba cloud servers.\nNotable among the tools are listed below -\nBrowser Exploitation Framework (BeEF), a publicly available pentesting software for executing commands within the browser context\nViper C2, a modular C2 framework that facilitates remote command execution and generation of Meterpreter reverse shell payloads\nBlue-Lotus, a JavaScript webshell cross-site scripting (XSS) attack framework that enables the creation of JavaScript web shell payloads to conduct XSS attacks, capture screenshots, obtain reverse shell, steal browser cookies, and create new accounts in the Content Management System (CMS)\n\"We assess with moderate confidence that the attacker's motive extends beyond just credential harvesting, based on our observation of other post-exploitation activities, such as establishing persistence, elevating to SYSTEM level privilege, and potential access to adversarial frameworks, indicating the likelihood of future attacks,\" Raghuprasad said.\nFound this article interesting?

(dba Kraken), WhiteBIT, AscendEX Technology SRL, Ftrader Ltd (dba FixedFloat), SwapSpace LLC, and Rabbit Finance LLC (dba CoinRabbit).\nA forfeiture complaint\nunsealed by the U.S. Justice Department yesterday and first spotted by crypto fraud investigator ZachXBT reveals that U.S. Secret Service agents who interviewed the victim believe the attackers could have only stolen the cryptocurrency using private keys extracted by cracking the victim's password vault stolen in a 2022 breach of an online password manager.\nThey found that the stolen data and passwords stored in several victims' password manager accounts were used by attackers to access \"their electronic accounts and steal information, cryptocurrency, and other data.\"\nThey also discovered no evidence that the victim's devices were hacked, which points to the decryption of the stolen online password manager data as the only way the attackers could have obtained the keys needed to compromise the victim's crypto wallet.\n\"The scale of a theft and rapid dissipation of funds would have required the efforts of multiple malicious actors, and was consistent with the online password manager breaches and attack on other victims whose cryptocurrency was stolen,\" the complaint reads.\n\"For these reasons, law enforcement agents believe the cryptocurrency stolen from Victim was committed by the same attackers who conducted the attack on the online password manager, and cryptocurrency thefts from other similarly situated victims.\"\nCrypto theft linked to LastPass hacks\nWhile the investigators didn't name the online password manager, the complaint says that the platform was hit by \"two major data breaches\" in August 2022 and November 2022.\nThis timeline aligns with security breaches disclosed by LastPass three years ago when the company said that attackers stole\nsource code and proprietary technical information\n, as well as\ncustomer vault data\n, after breaching its cloud storage.\nSince then, multiple security experts have shared that they believe the LastPass hackers have\ncracked some of the stolen vault data\nand used the extracted private keys and credentials in major cryptocurrency heists.\nEven though the investigators didn't identify the victim, the details match the hack and the theft of $150 million in cryptocurrency from Ripple co-founder and executive chairman Chris Larsen, which was\ndisclosed\non January 31, 2024.\nZachXBT\nfirst linked\nthe $23 million in cryptocurrency seized this week and the hack of Larsen's XRP wallet.\n\"A forfeiture complaint filed yesterday by US law enforcement revealed the cause for the ~$150M (283M XRP) hack of Ripple co-founder, Chris Larsen's wallet in Jan 2024 was the result of storing private keys in LastPass (password manager which was hacked in 2022),\" he said today in a Telegram message.\nA Ripple spokesperson was not immediately available when BleepingComputer reached out for comment earlier today.\nUpdate March 07, 14:40 EST:\nLastPass sent the following statement after publishing time:\nSince we initially disclosed this incident back in 2022, LastPass has worked in close cooperation with multiple representatives from law enforcement. To date, our law enforcement partners have not made us aware of any conclusive evidence that connects any crypto thefts to our incident.\nRelated Articles:\nUS seizes domain of Garantex crypto exchange used by ransomware gangs\nUS charges Garantex admins with money laundering, sanctions violations\nU.S. recovers $31 million stolen in 2021 Uranium Finance hack\nGrassCall malware campaign drains crypto wallets via fake job interviews\nFBI confirms Lazarus hackers were behind $1.5B Bybit crypto heist"

        "Content": "A critical command injection vulnerability impacting the Edimax IC-7100 IP camera is currently being exploited by botnet malware to compromise devices.\nThe flaw was discovered by Akamai researchers, who confirmed to BleepingComputer that the flaw is exploited in attacks that are still ongoing.\nAkamai researcher Kyle Lefton told BleepingComputer that they will provide more technical details about the flaw and the associated botnet next week.\nAfter discovering the flaw, Akamai reported it to the\nU.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA)\n, who attempted to contact the Taiwanese vendor.\n\"Both Akamai SIRT and CISA attempted to contact the vendor (Edimax) multiple times. CISA was unable to get a response from them,\" Lefton told BleepingComputer.com.\n\"I personally reached out to them and received a response, but all they said was that the device in question, IC-7100, was end of life, therefore not receiving further updates. As Edimax was unable to provide us with more information, it is possible that this CVE affects a wider range of devices, and it is unlikely that a patch will released.\"\nThe Edimax IC-7100 is an IP security camera for remote surveillance at homes, small office buildings, commercial facilities, and industrial settings.\nThe product isn't widely available in retail channels anymore. It was released in October 2011, and Edimax lists it under its 'legacy products,' suggesting it's no longer produced and is likely no longer supported.\nHowever, a significant number of those devices may still be used across the globe.\nThe Edimax vulnerability is tracked as\nCVE-2025-1316\nand is a critical severity (CVSS v4.0 score 9.3) OS command injection flaw caused by the improper neutralization of incoming requests.\nA remote attacker can exploit this flaw and gain remote code execution by sending specially crafted requests to the device.\nIn this case, the current exploitation is being performed by botnet malware to compromise the devices.\nBotnets typically use these devices to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, proxy malicious traffic, or pivot to other devices on the same network.\nGiven the situation and active exploitation status for CVE-2025-1316, impacted devices should be taken offline or replaced with actively supported products.\nCISA recommends that users minimize internet exposure for impacted devices, place them behind firewalls, and isolate them from critical business networks.\nMoreover, the U.S. agency recommends using up-to-date Virtual Private Network (VPN) products for secure remote access when required.\nCommon signs of compromised IoT devices include performance degradation, excessive heating, unexpected changes in device settings, and atypical/anomalous network traffic.\nRelated Articles:\n7-Zip MotW bypass exploited in zero-day attacks against Ukraine\nGoogle fixes Android kernel zero-day exploited in attacks\nHackers exploit critical unpatched flaw in Zyxel CPE devices\nNew Mirai botnet targets industrial routers with zero-day exploits\nOver 37,000 VMware ESXi servers vulnerable to ongoing attacks"

However, it has since switched to its own tactics and custom tooling and attack infrastructure.\nMicrosoft says Moonstone Sleet hackers are targeting both financial and cyberespionage targets using trojanized software (e.g., PuTTY), custom malware loaders, malicious games and npm packages, and fake software development companies (e.g., C.C.

        "Content": "At 49, Branden Spikes isn’t just one of the oldest technologists who has been involved in Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). As the current director of information technology at X/Twitter and an early hire at PayPal, Zip2, Tesla and SpaceX, Spikes is also among Musk’s most loyal employees. Here’s a closer look at this trusted Musk lieutenant, whose Russian ex-wife was once married to Elon’s cousin.\nThe profile of Branden Spikes on X.\nWhen President Trump took office again in January, he put the world’s richest man — Elon Musk — in charge of the U.S. Digital Service, and renamed the organization as DOGE. The group is reportedly staffed by at least 50 technologists, many of whom have ties to Musk’s companies.\nDOGE has been enabling the president’s ongoing mass layoffs and firings of federal workers, largely by seizing control over computer systems and government data for a multitude of federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Treasury Department.\nIt is difficult to find another person connected to DOGE who has stronger ties to Musk than Branden Spikes. A native of California, Spikes initially teamed up with Musk in 1997 as a lead systems engineer for the software company Zip2, the first major venture for Musk. In 1999, Spikes was hired as director of IT at PayPal, and in 2002 he became just the fourth person hired at SpaceX.\nIn 2012, Spikes launched Spikes Security, a software product that sought to create a compartmentalized or “sandboxed” web browser that could insulate the user from malware attacks. A review of spikes.com in the Wayback Machine shows that as far back as 1998, Musk could be seen joining Spikes for team matches in the online games Quake and Quake II. In 2016, Spikes Security was merged with another security suite called Aurionpro, with the combined company renamed Cyberinc.\nA snapshot of spikes.com from 1998 shows Elon Musk’s profile in Spike’s clan for the games Quake and Quake II.\nSpikes’s LinkedIn profile says he was appointed head of IT at X in February 2025. And although his name shows up on none of the lists of DOGE employees circulated by various media outlets, multiple sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Spikes was working with DOGE and operates within Musk’s inner circle of trust.\nIn a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity, Spikes said he is dedicated to his country and to saving it from what he sees as certain ruin.\n“Myself, I was raised by a southern conservative family in California and I strongly believe in America and her future,” Spikes said. “This is why I volunteered for two months in DC recently to help DOGE save us from certain bankruptcy.”\nSpikes told KrebsOnSecurity that he recently decided to head back home and focus on his job as director of IT at X.\n“I loved it, but ultimately I did not want to leave my hometown and family back in California,” Spikes said of his tenure at DOGE. “After a couple of months it became clear that to continue helping I would need to move to DC and commit a lot more time, so I politely bowed out.”\nPrior to founding Spikes Security, Branden Spikes was married to a native Russian woman named Natalia whom he’d met at a destination wedding in South America in 2003.\nBranden and Natalia’s names are both on the registration records for the domain name orangetearoom[.]com. This domain, which DomainTools.com says was originally registered by Branden in 2009, is the home of a tax-exempt charity in Los Angeles called the California Russian Association.\nHere is a photo from a 2011 event organized by the California Russian Association, showing Branden and Natalia at one of its “White Nights” charity fundraisers:\nBranden and Natalia Spikes, on left, in 2011. The man on the far right is Ivan Y. Podvalov, a board member of the Kremlin-aligned Congress of Russian Americans (CRA). The man in the center is Feodor Yakimoff, director of operations at the Transib Global Sourcing Group, and chairman of the Russian Imperial Charity Balls, which works in concert with the Russian Heritage Foundation.\nIn 2011, the Spikes couple got divorced, and Natalia changed her last name to Haldeman. That is not her maiden name, which appears to be “Libina.” Rather, Natalia acquired the surname Haldeman in 1998, when she married Elon Musk’s cousin.\nReeve Haldeman is the son of Scott Haldeman, who is the brother of Elon Musk’s mother, Maye Musk. Divorce records show Reeve and Natalia officially terminated their marriage in 2007. Reeve Haldeman did not respond to a request for comment.\nA review of other domain names connected to Natalia Haldeman’s email address show she has registered more than a dozen domains over the years that are tied to the California Russian Association, and an apparently related entity called the Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc.:\nrussianamericans.org\nrussianamericanstoday.com\nrussianamericanstoday.org\nrussiancalifornia.org\nrussianheritagefoundation.com\nrussianheritagefoundation.org\nrussianwhitenights.com\nrussianwhitenights.org\ntheforafoundation.org\nthegoldentearoom.com\ntherussianheritagefoundation.org\ntsarinahome.com\nMs. Haldeman did not respond to requests for comment. Her name and contact information appears in the registration records for these domains dating back to 2010, and a document published by ProPublica show that by 2016 Natalia Haldeman was appointed CEO of the California Russian Foundation.\nThe domain name that bears both Branden’s and Natalia’s names — orangetearoom.com — features photos of Ms. Haldeman at fundraising events for the Russian foundation through 2014. Additional photos of her and many of the same people can be seen through 2023 at another domain she registered in 2010 — russianheritagefoundation.com.\nA photo from Natalia Haldeman’s Facebook page shows her mother (left) pictured with Maye Musk, Elon Musk’s mother, in 2022.\nThe photo of Branden and Natalia above is from one such event in 2011 (tied to russianwhitenights.org, another Haldeman domain). The person on the right in that image — Ivan Y. Podvalov — appears in many fundraising event photos published by the foundation over the past decade. Podvalov is a board member of the Congress of Russian Americans (CRA), a nonprofit group that is known for vehemently opposing U.S. financial and legal sanctions against Russia.\nWriting for The Insider in 2022, journalist Diana Fishman described how the CRA has engaged in outright political lobbying, noting that the organization in June 2014 sent a letter to President Obama and the secretary of the United Nations, calling for an end to the “large-scale US intervention in Ukraine and the campaign to isolate Russia.”\n“The US military contingents must be withdrawn immediately from the Eastern European region, and NATO’s enlargement efforts and provocative actions against Russia must cease,” the message read.\nThe Insider said the CRA director sent another two letters, this time to President Donald Trump, in 2017 and 2018.\n“One was a request not to sign a law expanding sanctions against Russia,” Fishman wrote. “The other regretted the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats from the United States and urged not to jump to conclusions on Moscow’s involvement in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal.”\nThe nonprofit tracking website CauseIQ.com reports that The Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc. is now known as Constellation of Humanity.\nThe Russian Heritage Foundation and the California Russian Association both promote the interests of the Russian Orthodox Church. This page indexed by Archive.org from russiancalifornia.org shows The California Russian Foundation organized a community effort to establish an Orthodox church in Orange County, Calif.\nA press release from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) shows that in 2021 the Russian Heritage Foundation donated money to organize a conference for the Russian Orthodox Church in Serbia.\nA review of the “Partners” listed on the Spikes’ jointly registered domain — orangetearoom.com — shows the organization worked with a marketing company called Russian American Media. Reporting by KrebsOnSecurity last year showed that Russian American Media also partners with the problematic people-search service Radaris, which was formed by two native Russian brothers in Massachusetts who have built a fleet of consumer data brokers and Russian affiliate programs.\nWhen asked about his ex-wife’s history, Spikes said she has a good heart and bears no ill-will toward anyone.\n“I attended several of Natalia’s social events over the years we were together and can assure you that she’s got the best intentions with those,” Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity. “There’s no funny business going on. It is just a way for those friendly immigrants to find resources amongst each other to help get settled in and chase the American dream. I mean, they’re not unlike the immigrants from other countries who come to America and try to find each other and help each other find others who speak the language and share in the building of their businesses here in America.”\nSpikes said his own family roots go back deeply into American history, sharing that his 6th great grandfather was Alexander Hamilton on his mom’s side, and Jessie James on his dad’s side.\n“My family roots are about as American as you can get,” he said. “I’ve also been entrusted with building and safeguarding Elon’s companies since 1999 and have a keen eye (as you do) for bad actors, so have enough perspective to tell you that Natalia has no bad blood and that she loves America.”\nOf course, this perspective comes from someone who has the utmost regard for the interests of the “special government employee” Mr. Musk, who has been bragging about tossing entire federal agencies into the “wood chipper,” and who recently wielded an actual chainsaw on stage while referring to it as the “chainsaw for bureaucracy.”\n“Elon’s intentions are good and you can trust him,” Spikes assured.\nA special note of thanks for research assistance goes to Jacqueline Sweet, an independent investigative journalist whose work has been published in The Guardian, Rolling Stone, POLITICO and The Intercept.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Thursday 6th of March 2025 07:54 PM \r\n         \nCould you clarify what you mean by “seizing control over computer systems”, from a technical aspect? Is it more than getting login credentials? admin credentials? Are they changing system parameters, etc.? Are they blocking/removing those who were previously controlling the systems?\nDo you not see a problem with these guys having root access to our key systems? Several of them have ties to russia, and i think it’s pretty obvious where trump, musk, vance, kash pattel, and tulsi gabbard get their bread buttered. This is not normal and it’s very likely our nations key secrets are no longer secret. Also I would suspect that back doors are being installed. Also how do you feel about your social security money?\n you’re some really dumb fk! your money 300 bucks in your chase account.. and your ssn that was leaked 1000s of times on the dark web.  Fkin nitwit\nThey have all of those powers, however they end up using them on individual systems varies.\nHes being dramatic and they do not have root access and they have not siezed access they have been granted access… its called “Russel Conjugation” or “emotive conjugation”.   Hes using over the top words to describe a situation he doesnt agree with.\n“Podvalov is a board member of the Congress of Russian Americans (CRA), a nonprofit group that is known for vehemently opposing U.S. financial and legal sanctions against Russia.\nWriting for The Insider in 2022, journalist Diana Fishman described how the CRA has engaged in outright political lobbying, noting that the organization in June 2014 sent a letter to President Obama and the secretary of the United Nations, calling for an end to the “large-scale US intervention in Ukraine and the campaign to isolate Russia.”\nJustifiably so in both cases. The US has been pushing Ukraine to fight Russia since after WWII, and especially since Ukraine split from the Soviet Union, and even more so leading up to the 2014 Maidan crisis. The Ukrainians, especially western Ukrainian nationalists, have been stupid enough to follow the US’ lead – which has now resulted in over a million, probably a million and a half, Ukrainian casualties, the reduction of Ukraine’s population by emgration by twenty million, the annihilation of the Ukraine economy (which the US taxpayer is now paying for – or was until Trump supposedly stopped that recently), and has enabled Russia to expand its military by almost 100% and force it to develop missile technologies for which the US and NATO have ZERO capability to deal with. Not mention the Russian economy, stimulated to cut off the West by Western sanctions, is going great guns, better than any European country.\nSo now we’re bitching about Russian immigrants, are we? Trust me, damn few Russians want to come to the US now, but quite a few Western country citizens are emigrating to Russia.\nWho cares who this guy Spikes is? It’s the moron Musk that is the technocrat threat to democracy along with the utter moron Trump.\n@Brian: Thank you for meticulously digging out less known facts.\n@Richard: Please get some serious history education to correct your flawed narratives. The current leadership of the Russian Federation is a revisionist imperialistic bunch of ex-KGB guys grabbing power together with organized crime elements from St. Petersburg and willing oligarchs. They want to recreate a sphere of influence like that ceded half of Europe to Stalin at the Yalta Conference. For good reasons former Warsaw Pacts countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria joined NATO to be never subjugated to Soviet oppression again. The same is true  since 2014 for Ukraine. To say that the US initiated Ukraine to fight against Russia is since WW II is blatantly wrong and result of (unfortunately very good) Russian propaganda. A police dictatorship like Russia could never tolerate a democratic free country beside it’s borders as this imperils a dictator like Putin, not to forget the important industrial assets of Ukraine to be secured for Russia.\nApart from the last sentence, the rest of your rant is a load of tripe and hardly deserves a response; but i’ll bite.\n‘US has been pushing Ukraine to fight Russia since after WWII’\nDon’t flatter yourself. Ukraine has been fighting Russia for self determination long before the mighty USA was even a country. Think: Kievan Rus’ and Mongol Invasions, the Cossack Wars, 19th-Century Repression and National Awakening and the Ukrainian War of Independence; all before WWII, which renders your whole discourse moot.\n‘probably a million and a half, Ukrainian casualties,’\nBollocks. Zelensky reported that approximately 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the invasion’s onset. Other sources have suggested higher figures, with some reports indicating up to 400,000 military casualties (killed and wounded);\nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/death-toll-latest-war-kqb8xwrqc\nThis is all speculation of course, but I’d be curious what the Kremlin is reporting Russian casualties as?\n‘reduction of Ukraine’s population by emgration by twenty million’\nMore bollocks. 6 million at most, mainly women and children, most gainfully employed by their host countries;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_refugee_crisis\nWhat about Russian emigration then? Reports indicating numbers as high as 1.3 million.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\nThis mass exodus includes a significant portion of young, educated professionals, leading to concerns about a “brain drain” and potential long-term demographic challenges for Russia. Mmmmm.\n‘and force it to develop missile technologies for which the US and NATO have ZERO capability to deal with.’\nDespite the fact that the Ukrainians have taken land, sea and air drone warfare to a level never seen before by any military globally EVER!! And have used this technology to inflict exponentially more damage on Russian assets than ‘hYpErsONicS’ ever will, at a FRACTION of the cost.\n‘Not mention the Russian economy, …. , is going great guns, better than any European country.’\nIf the war stops TODAY, the Russian economy will collapse and its society with it. But of course, the Oligarchs will be OK.\nIf you don’t believe me, here are 2 Russian sources;\nhttps://theins.ru/en/economics/277728\nhttps://theins.ru/en/economics/277585\n‘but quite a few Western country citizens are emigrating to Russia.’\nI very much doubt it. Sources would be nice, but I’m not holding my breath. 😉\nStupid everyone else, except Russia is the one who invaded Ukraine.  Nice story comrade.\nEnjoy your move back to the motherland, d’strovia.\nwikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War\nWhy not look things up before you try to implausibly make them up?  Would it kill you?\nAccording to NATO and Western military officials, around 1,200 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded in Ukraine every day on average in May and June 2024.[119][120] In July 2024, Chief of the General Staff of the British Army Sir Roland Walker said that with the current way of fighting, it would take Russia five years to control the four regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia that Russia claims as its own, and it would cost Russia from 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties.[121] He said there are “no winners” in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, adding that “it is an utter devastation for both sides and lost generations.”[122] By August 2024, the daily average of Russian military casualties in the conflict was about 1,000 soldiers, according to a Western official.\nRussia is small potatoes…. GDP is lower than Canada… 1/2 of Germany… etc.. etc..  but it sounds like Rich is arguing that US sanctions have helped their economy go “great guns”.  I guess there’s no problem then.  Become a barracks nation if ya like. Ain’t the west’s problem.  Twas a BIG mistake to invade.  Once they’re plan to take Kyiv quickly and make a regime change happen failed, they should have aborted the mission.  Trump’s action often align with Russia’s so it’s worth looking into any ties to Russian organizations in the US.  Everything that Trump does in regards to Ukraine seems to suggest one of his puppet-masters is Putin.\nalso worth considering is Musk’s connection to the war via Starlink: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink_in_the_Russian-Ukrainian_War  Interesting bits include USAID, Department of Defense, the Pentagon, etc…\nThank you for the deep research – I hope this story gets coverage. Scary times.\n“sharing that his 6th great grandfather was Alexander Hamilton on his mom’s side, and Jessie James on his dad’s side”\nI would love to find out that that was incredibly invented. But you never know in America.\nWow – just wow. It doesn’t matter which way you look, the swamp got a whole lot murkier.\nThanks Brian. And to J. Sweet as well. Let it be known Branden better keep his delicate little tuxedoed pinkies off of our personal information (our personal property) held in trust at SSA and IRS. Appropriating that is unconstitutional.\nWhat are you trying to say with this article?\nPlease focus on security, not this crap\nPlease focus on starting your own blog, not this crap ultimatum.\nDon’t read if you don’t like.\nKrebs is writing about Security (capital S) here, the Security of our country, which is being compromised by the current “administration.”\nHysteria.  Take a look in the miirror: Just look at what the USA does in (rather to) other countries …..\nBrian – can you just stick to the knitting – i.e the technical stuff is great\nThanks\nStart your own blog, one that you dictate to.\n> *for those friendly immigrants*\n“Ahh Mikhail, those pindosy are falling for it again and again”\n*tin*\n“Na zdrovye!” “Zdarova!” – laughing and coughing with bits of spit\nThanks for focusing on the most important security threat to the USA. Congratulations to you and Jacqueline investigation.  I found your reporting in the (When asked about his ex-wife’s history) section to be the most interesting. It reminded me of phrase, “Nothing to see here.”\nBTW, http://orangeteamroom.com/ Homepage, states, “This site can’t be reached”\nEach denial created a full catalog of goals for “Opposite Intentions Day”.\nIt’s a question of velocity Brian. Will we gain enough clarity before the USA is crushed?\nSorry. That was a typo. It’s supposed to be orangetearoom dot com.\nThis is somewhat giving cold war witch hunt. Interesting read, and I certainly will never trust Musk, but the entire Natalia bit seems unproblematic\nGreat report Brian. Safe to say that Space X secrets are safe in the Kremlin by now. I noticed this quote:  ” …..so I politely bowed out.” This sounds like his security clearance was pulled.\nTwo questions, I’m trying to follow along, it sounds like you are implying muskrat and his friends have relations with Russian spies that posed as personal relationship seekers and have corrupted them into Russian spies accessing US government secrets?\nYou mentioned those two played Q2 and Q3, but didn’t mention their game names. I would like to know, I used to be big into those, wondering if I played against them.\nI personally see musk as an egomaniac surrounded by yes men, but to rich to be bribed by RU. Watching for your mind map of the corruption.\nThanks,\n“…who recently wielded an actual chainsaw on stage while referring to it as the “chainsaw for bureaucracy.”\nToo bad he didn’t drop it on his head. Would have solved a lot of problems.\nI am not sure you’ll be proud of this article in a few years. Unless, of course, you have information related to Spikes that you have chose to withhold at the present.\nI agree with Daniel in the comments. This doesn’t seem like very useful information.\nAppreciate that this isn’t a sensationalized approach, but the ties mentioned here don’t seem particularly strong.\nLately the articles from Krebs seem to be of a different flavor than historically.\nMaybe I missed the hit pieces on all the Chinese ties to the Biden syndicate – truly, I may have – but this piece has no useful information in it.  I used to come to this site for technical news and awareness but it appears Brian is heading a different direction – which is perfectly fine and his right to do.  I’ll head elsewhere for technical news.\nI wish you all the best in your new field, Brian.  Thank you for several years of excellent IT/IS coverage and I appreciate your work.\nMaybe because there were none?\nOnce again the meritocracy proclaimed by the billionaire elitist oligarchs is nothing more than thinly veiled cronyism.\nWhat has this guy done to prove his knowledge, skills, and abilities plus the work effort he puts in?\nWait, wrong question, avert your eyes and don’t question power. Look here’s some federal worker making $30K who took a 10 minute bathroom break, THERE’S your deep state societal rot!\nRather average looking guy with a high profile in a tech company meets and marries a woman who appears looks wise to be out of his league at destination wedding. TOTALLY random meeting, I’m sure. \nThis is something out of Spycraft 001.\nAmericans have voted in Russian hand puppets.

An attacker can achieve remote command execution through specially crafted requests.\n\n\n\nEdimax is a networking solutions provider based in Taiwan. According to CISA’s advisory, the products affected by the zero-day are used in the commercial facilities sector around the world. \n\n\n\n\nCISA suggested that the vulnerability has likely not been patched by Edimax, and urged users to reach out to the vendor. IC-7100 network cameras are listed as ‘legacy products’ by the vendor, which means they have likely reached end of life and end of support. \n\n\n\nThe agency’s advisory does not specifically say that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, but it does note that “organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents”.\n\n\n\nCISA said the vulnerability was discovered by CDN, cloud and cybersecurity solutions provider Akamai, which confirmed to SecurityWeek that it has seen CVE-2025-1316 being exploited in the wild since the fall of 2024. The company identified the vulnerability while monitoring botnet activity. \n\n\n\nAkamai researcher Kyle Lefton said the vulnerability has been exploited by multiple Mirai-based botnets. The Edimax camera flaw is one of the many vulnerabilities exploited by these botnets to ensnare devices — CVE-2025-1316 is one of the latest to be added to these botnets’ arsenal.\n\n\n\nLefton clarified that exploitation of CVE-2025-1316 requires authentication, but attackers are leveraging the fact that many internet-exposed cameras can be accessed with known default credentials.\n\n\n\nOnce they have gained access to a device, the attackers run a remote command execution exploit and execute a shell script that downloads a Mirai malware payload from a remote server, Lefton explained.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nSecurityWeek reached out to Edimax for comment before this article was published, but the company has not responded. \n\n\n\nThe vendor, first notified in October 2024, has been unresponsive to CISA and Akamai’s attempts to coordinate disclosure of the vulnerability, but it did tell Akamai last year that it does not patch vulnerabilities in products that have reached end of life. \n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Akamai believes the vendor should take the vulnerability more seriously as it could impact even supported products.\n\n\n\nDespite its advisory suggesting that CVE-2025-1316 has been exploited, CISA has yet to add the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.  \n\n\n\nAkamai will release a blog post describing these attacks in the coming days. \n\n\n\nRelated: Vo1d Botnet Evolves as It Ensnares 1.6 Million Android TV Boxes\nRelated: BadBox Botnet Powered by 1 Million Android Devices Disrupted\nRelated: New Eleven11bot DDoS Botnet Powered by 80,000 Hacked Devices\n\nCISA published an advisory on March 4 to inform users of Edimax IC-7100 IP cameras that the devices are affected by CVE-2025-1316, a critical command injection issue caused by failure to properly neutralize requests.

It has three core capabilities: discover AI inventory, secure AI assets, and manage threats with detect, investigate, and respond capabilities.\n\n\n\nAI Protection integrates with Google’s Security Command Center (SCC) to provide teams with a centralized view of their IT posture and manage AI risks in the context of other cloud risks.\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Google Cloud\nDiscovering AI inventory. The old CISO adage of ‘you cannot secure what you cannot see’ is writ large in the AI era. But, writes Archana Ramamoorthy Senior Director, product management at Google Cloud Security in a blog on AI Protection, “Our capabilities help you automatically discover and catalog AI assets, including the use of models, applications, and data — and their relationships.”\n\n\n\nCoupled with this, Google Cloud’s Sensitive Data Protection now extends its automated discovery to Vertex AI datasets. Vertex is Google Cloud’s gen-AI development platform that includes more than 150 foundation models including Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash.\n\n\n\nWhen you know what you have and where it is, the integration with SCC comes in – virtual red teaming can be invoked to recognize ‘toxic combinations’ and possible attack paths, and to provide remediation recommendations.\n\n\n\nSecuring AI assets. AI Protection’s Model Armor is a key component in securing the LLMs and their use. It detects and prevents prompt injection and jailbreak attempts. It inspects prompts and sanitizes them before passing to the LLM. It inspects responses and sanitizes them before passing to the user. It uses RBAC to manage access and permissions; it filters for indecent or harassing content and malicious URLs; and it provides data loss prevention through Google Cloud’s Sensitive Data Protection preventing the leakage of both IP and PII.\n\n\n\nManaging AI threats. AI Protection calls upon the combined intelligence and research available from both Google and Mandiant. “Detectors in Security Command Center can be used to uncover initial access attempts, privilege escalation, and persistence attempts for AI workloads,” writes Ramamoorthy.\n\n\n\nOverall, AI protection offers a suite of capabilities to defend against the new risks directly associated with the growing use of AI models. But in many senses, it is more than just a new product – it’s an expansion of the Google Cloud AI security platform, and its integration with other Google Cloud offerings provides a wider solution to AI security issues. Integration with SCC ensures that AI security can be viewed in the context of all network threats, and doesn’t become a separate siloed requirement.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nIntegration with Sensitive Data protection can help with regulatory compliance. This can be enhanced by Google Cloud’s Assured Workloads which can control the geographic region in which data at rest is located — essential for heavily regulated industries and European regulations. Integration with Confidential Computing protects data at rest and in transit, and “can help ensure data remains protected throughout the entire processing pipeline, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, even by privileged users or malicious actors within the system,” writes Ramamoorthy.\n\n\n\nSo, while AI Protection is a major new AI security product, it is best viewed as a key component in an umbrella AI protection. This is important. A Darktrace survey (PDF) of 1,500 security professionals working with AI, released on March 4, 2025, notes, “CISOs have expressed a preference for broader platforms over point products (89%)”\n\n\n\nAI Protection on Google Cloud provides a broad AI security platform. “Piecemeal solutions can leave and have left critical vulnerabilities exposed, rendering organizations susceptible to threats like adversarial attacks or data poisoning, and added to the overwhelm experienced by security teams,” adds Grace Trinidad, research director, IDC. “Google Cloud simplifies and thus improves the experience of securing AI for customers.”\n\n\n\nRelated: AIceberg Gets $10 Million in Seed Funding for AI Security Platform\nRelated: Pangea Launches AI Guard and Prompt Guard to Combat Gen-AI Security Risks\nRelated: Singulr Launches With $10M in Funding for AI Security and Governance Platform\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Artificial Intelligence\n\nGoogle Cloud’s AI Protection is designed to “to help teams comprehensively manage AI risk”.

However, the group was also seen targeting VMware ESXi and Mirth Connect flaws.\n\n\n\nIn some instances, the hackers likely hijacked legitimate accounts, possibly using “initial access brokers for infiltration,” Symantec notes.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nAfter gaining access to a network, the attackers were seen deploying living-off-the-land and dual-use tools, including AnyDesk, Mesh Agent, PDQ Deploy, and SimpleHelp remote access tools, KillAVDriver, KillAV, Navicat, NetScan, PDQ Inventory, Rclone, and Robocopy.\n\n\n\nSpearwing and its affiliates used these tools for remote access, to deploy and abuse vulnerable drivers to disable security tools, move laterally, run database queries, scan networks, exfiltrate data, dump credentials, and delete shadow copies.\n\n\n\nAccording to Symantec, the group develops the Medusa ransomware itself, while also carrying out many of the attacks. It only has a small number of affiliates, providing them with both the file-encrypting ransomware and with an attack playbook.\n\n\n\nFollowing a successful attack, the victim’s files are encrypted and appended the .medusa extension, a ransom note is dropped on the system, and the Medusa ransomware is deleted. The group demands that a ransom be paid within 10 days, but allows victims to extend the deadline for $10,000 per day.\n\n\n\nIn January 2025, the group hit a US healthcare organization, lingering in its network for four days before deploying file-encrypting ransomware. Based on some of the executed commands, Symantec believes that it was a hands-on-keyboard attack, rather than automated activity.\n\n\n\nRelated: Ransomware Group Claims Attack on Tata Technologies\nRelated: Vulnerable Paragon Driver Exploited in Ransomware Attacks\nRelated: New Anubis Ransomware Could Pose Major Threat to Organizations\nRelated: Chinese APT Tools Found in Ransomware Schemes, Blurring Attribution Lines\n\nFirst seen in early 2023, Medusa operates under the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, with its affiliates targeting organizations in healthcare, manufacturing, education, and other sectors in the US, Australia, Israel, India, Portugal, the UK, UAE, and other countries.\n\n\n\nEngaging in double-extortion tactics, stealing victims’ data, and threatening to release it publicly unless a ransom is paid, Medusa’s operators have listed roughly 400 victims on their Tor-based leak site.\n\n\n\nTracked as Spearwing and Storm-1175, the ransomware group has been demanding ransom payments ranging between $100,000 and $15 million.\n\n\n\nAccording to Symantec, the number of Medusa ransomware attacks grew 42% between 2023 and 2024, and the activity continues to increase.\n\n\n\nAs law enforcement took action against known ransomware gangs such as BlackCat and LockBit, Medusa has risen to fill the gap along with groups such as RansomHub and Qilin.\n\n\n\nAccording to Symantec, Medusa’s affiliates have been targeting unpatched vulnerabilities in internet-facing appliances, mainly in Microsoft Exchange Server.
