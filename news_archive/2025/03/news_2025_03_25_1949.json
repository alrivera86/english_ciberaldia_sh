It's also referred to as a QNAP worm owing to the use of compromised QNAP devices to retrieve the payload.\nOver the years, Raspberry Robin attack chains have added a new distribution method that involves downloading it via archives and Windows Script Files sent as attachments using the messaging service Discord, not to mention\nacquiring one-day exploits\nto achieve local privilege escalation before they were publicly disclosed.\nThere is also some\nevidence\nto suggest that the malware is offered to other actors as a pay-per-install (PPI) botnet to deliver next-stage malware.\nFurthermore, Raspberry Robin infections have incorporated a\nUSB-based propagation mechanism\nthat involves using a compromised USB drive containing a Windows shortcut (LNK) file disguised as a folder to activate the deployment of the malware.\nThe U.S. government has since\nrevealed\nthat the Russian nation-state threat actor tracked as Cadet Blizzard may have used Raspberry Robin as an initial access facilitator.\nSilent Push, in its latest analysis undertaken along with Team Cymru, found one IP address that was being used as a data relay to connect all compromised QNAP devices, ultimately leading to the discovery of over 180 unique C2 domains.\n\"The singular IP address was connected through Tor relays, which is likely how network operators issued new commands and interacted with compromised devices,\" the company said. \"The IP used for this relay was based in an E.U. country.\"\nA deeper investigation of the infrastructure has revealed that the Raspberry Robin C2 domains are short – e.g., q2[.]rs​, m0[.]wf​, h0[.]wf, and 2i[.]pm – and that they are rapidly rotated between compromised devices and through IPs using a\ntechnique\ncalled\nfast flux\nin an effort to make it challenging to take them down.\nSome of the top Raspberry Robin top-level domains (TLDs) are .wf​, .pm​, .re​, .nz​, .eu​, .gy​, .tw, and .cx, with domains registered using niche registrars like Sarek Oy, 1API GmbH, NETIM, Epag[.]de, CentralNic Ltd, and Open SRS. A majority of the identified C2 domains have name servers on a Bulgarian company named ClouDNS.\n\"Raspberry Robin's use by Russian government threat actors aligns with its history of working with countless other serious threat actors, many of whom have connections to Russia,\" the company said. \"These include LockBit, Dridex, SocGholish, DEV-0206, Evil Corp (DEV-0243), Fauppod, FIN11, Clop Gang, and Lace Tempest (TA505).\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A major telecommunications company located in Asia was allegedly breached by Chinese state-sponsored hackers who spent over four years inside its systems, according to a new report from incident response firm Sygnia.\nThe cybersecurity company is tracking the activity under the name\nWeaver Ant\n, describing the threat actor as stealthy and highly persistent. The name of the telecom provider was not disclosed.\n\"Using web shells and tunneling, the attackers maintained persistence and facilitated cyber espionage,\" Sygnia\nsaid\n. \"The group behind this intrusion [...] aimed to gain and maintain continuous access to telecommunication providers and facilitate cyber espionage by collecting sensitive information.\"\nThe attack chain is said to have involved the exploitation of a public-facing application to drop two different web shells, an encrypted variant of China Chopper and a previously undocumented malicious tool dubbed INMemory. It's worth noting that China Chopper has been put to use by\nmultiple\nChinese hacking groups\nin the past.\nINMemory, as the name implies, is designed to decode a Base64-encoded string and execute it entirely in memory without writing it to disk, thereby leaving no forensic trail.\n\"The 'INMemory' web shell executed the C# code contained within a portable executable (PE) named 'eval.dll,' which ultimately runs the payload delivered via an HTTP request,\" Sygnia said.\nThe web shells have been found to act as a stepping stone to deliver next-stage payloads, the most notable being a recursive HTTP tunnel tool that is utilized to facilitate lateral movement over SMB, a tactic previously adopted by other threat actors like\nElephant Beetle\n.\nWhat's more, the encrypted traffic passing through the web shell tunnel serves as a conduit to perform a series of post-exploitation actions, including -\nPatching Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) to bypass detection\nUsing System.Management.Automation.dll to execute PowerShell commands without initiating PowerShell.exe, and\nExecuting reconnaissance commands against the compromised Active Directory environment to identify high-privilege accounts and critical servers\nSygnia said Weaver Ant exhibits hallmarks typically associated with a China-nexus cyber espionage group owing to the targeting patterns and the \"well-defined\" goals of the campaign.\nThis link is also evidenced by the presence of the China Chopper web shell, the use of an Operational Relay Box (ORB) network comprising Zyxel routers to proxy traffic and obscure their infrastructure, the working hours of the hackers, and the deployment of an\nOutlook-based backdoor\nformerly attributed to Emissary Panda.\n\"Throughout this period, Weaver Ant adapted their TTPs to the evolving network environment, employing innovative methods to regain access and sustain their foothold,\" the company said. \"The modus operandi of Chinese-nexus intrusion sets typically involves the sharing of tools, infrastructure, and occasionally manpower—such as through shared contractors.\"\nChina Identifies 4 Taiwanese Hackers Allegedly Behind Espionage\nThe disclosure comes days after China's Ministry of State Security (MSS)\naccused\nfour individuals purportedly linked to Taiwan's military of conducting cyber attacks against the mainland. Taiwan has\nrefuted\nthe allegations.\nThe MSS said the four individuals are members of Taiwan's Information, Communications, and Electronic Force Command (ICEFCOM), and that the entity engages in phishing attacks, propaganda emails targeting government and military agencies, and disinformation campaigns using social media aliases.\nThe intrusions are also alleged to have involved the extensive use of open-source tools like the\nAntSword\nweb shell, IceScorpion, Metasploit, and Quasar RAT.\n\"The 'Information, Communications and Electronic Force Command' has specifically hired hackers and cybersecurity companies as external support to execute the cyber warfare directives issued by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities,\" it said. \"Their activities include espionage, sabotage, and propaganda.\"\nCoinciding with the MSS statement, Chinese cybersecurity firms\nQiAnXin\nand\nAntiy\nhave detailed spear-phishing attacks orchestrated by a Taiwanese threat actor codenamed APT-Q-20 (aka APT-C-01, GreenSpot, Poison Cloud Vine, and White Dolphin) that lead to the delivery of a C++ trojan and command-and-control (C2) frameworks like Cobalt Strike and Sliver.\nOther initial access methods entails the exploitation of N-day security vulnerabilities and weak passwords in Internet of Things devices such as routers, cameras, and firewalls, QiAnXin added, characterizing the threat actor's activities as \"not particularly clever.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Organizations now use an average of\n112 SaaS applications\n—a number that keeps growing. In a 2024 study, 49% of 644 respondents who frequently used Microsoft 365 believed that they had less than 10 apps connected to the platform, despite the fact that\naggregated data indicated over 1,000+ Microsoft 365 SaaS-to-SaaS connections\non average per deployment. And that's just one major SaaS provider. Imagine other unforeseen critical security risks:\nEach SaaS app has unique security configurations\n—making misconfigurations a top risk.\nBusiness-critical apps\n(CRM, finance, and collaboration tools) store vast amounts of sensitive data, making them prime targets for attackers.\nShadow IT and third-party integrations\nintroduce hidden vulnerabilities that often go unnoticed.\nLarge and small third-party AI service providers\n(e.g. audio/video transcription service) may not comply with legal and regulatory requirements, or properly test and review code.\nMajor SaaS providers also have thousands of developers pushing changes every day. Understanding each SaaS app, assessing risks, and securing configurations is overwhelming and inhumanly possible. And much of it is just noise. Perhaps nothing malicious is going on at scale, but small details can often be overlooked.\nTraditional security approaches simply cannot scale to meet these demands, leaving organizations exposed to potential breaches.\nAI: The Only Way to Keep Up\nThe complexity of SaaS security is outpacing the resources and effort needed to secure it.\nAI is no longer optional, it's essential.\nAI-driven security solutions like AskOmni\nby AppOmni—which combine Generative AI (or GenAI) and advanced analytics—are transforming SaaS security by:\n✓ Delivering instant security insights\nthrough conversational AI.\n✓ Investigating security events efficiently.\n✓ Turning complex SaaS security questions into clear, actionable answers.\n✓ Visualizing risks\nfor deeper understanding.\n✓ Breaking language barriers\n—multi-lingual support enables security teams to interact with AI in Japanese, French, and English. With multi-lingual support, teams worldwide can interact with security data in their native language—enhancing accessibility and response times.\nFor example, with its ability to stitch together context from disparate data points, AskOmni can notify administrators about issues caused by overprovisioning of privileges, taking into account access patterns, sensitive data, or compliance requirements, and guide them through the remediation process. Beyond typical threat notifications, AskOmni alerts administrators to new threats, explaining potential consequences and offering prioritized remediation steps.\nThe Power of AI + Data Depth\nHigh-quality data is the fuel that powers GenAI, but it's often in short supply. While GenAI is increasingly used to create synthetic data for simulations, detection testing, or red-teaming exercises, the quality of that data determines the effectiveness of the outcomes.\nGenerative models require clean, relevant, and unbiased datasets to avoid producing inaccurate or misleading results. That's a major challenge in cybersecurity domains where high-fidelity threat intel, logs, and labeled incident data are scarce or siloed.\nFor instance, building a GenAI model to simulate cloud breach scenarios demands access to detailed, context-rich telemetry—something that's not always available due to privacy concerns or lack of standardized formats.\nBut GenAI can be a powerful tool that can automate\nthreat research\nto accelerate incident reporting, helping streamline workflows for researchers, engineers, and analysts alike. Its success, however, depends on solving the data quality and availability gap first.\nIn SaaS security, finding fast, actionable answers traditionally means sifting through data, which can be time-consuming and requires expertise.\nAI is only as effective as the data it analyzes. The ability to analyze security events allows AI to provide deep visibility into SaaS environments and detect threats with greater accuracy. Security teams benefit from AI's ability to prioritize risks, correlate complex security observations, and provide recommendations grounded in real-world expertise.\nWith 101+ million users secured and 2+ billion security events processed daily, AppOmni ensures:\nDeep visibility into SaaS environments\nAccurate risk detection and prioritization\nActionable security insights grounded in expertise\nReal-World Impact: AI in Action\nA global enterprise recently leveraged AI to assess its complex SaaS environment. With just a few prompts, AskOmni efficiently analyzed the system and highlighted key areas for focus. AskOmni provided the following insights that one customer was able to immediately action and remediate:\nAn application bypassing IP restrictions\n: a critical misconfiguration.\nUnauthorized self-authorization in Salesforce\n: a major security gap.\nOutdated high-risk applications\n: flagged before they could be exploited.\nWithout AI, identifying these risks would have taken hours or been missed entirely.\nThe Present and Future Belongs to AI-Driven SaaS Security\nAI is not just enhancing the security of SaaS applications — it's redefining what is possible. Organizations using AI-powered security tools will gain a critical edge in protecting their data and staying ahead of cyber threats.\nStop searching, start asking.\nGet SaaS security answers with AppOmni\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

It represents an evolution of Xamarin, with added capabilities to not only create multi-platform apps using a single project, but also incorporate platform-specific source code as and when necessary.\nIt's worth noting that official support for Xamarin\nended on May 1, 2024\n, with the tech giant urging developers to migrate to .NET MAUI.\nWhile Android malware implemented using Xamarin has been\ndetected in the past\n, the latest development signals that threat actors are continuing to adapt and refine their tactics by developing new malware using .NET MAUI.\n\"These apps have their core functionalities written entirely in C# and stored as blob binaries,\" Shin said. \"This means that unlike traditional Android apps, their functionalities do not exist in DEX files or native libraries.\"\nThis gives a newfound advantage to threat actors in that .NET MAUI acts as a packer, allowing the malicious artifacts to evade detection and persist on victim devices for extended periods of time.\nThe .NET MAUI-based Android apps, collectively codenamed FakeApp, and their associated package names are listed below -\nX (pkPrIg.cljOBO)\n迷城 (pCDhCg.cEOngl)\nX (pdhe3s.cXbDXZ)\nX (ppl74T.cgDdFK)\nCupid (pommNC.csTgAT)\nX (pINUNU.cbb8AK)\n私密相册 (pBOnCi.cUVNXz)\nX•GDN (pgkhe9.ckJo4P)\n迷城 (pCDhCg.cEOngl)\n小宇宙 (p9Z2Ej.cplkQv)\nX (pDxAtR.c9C6j7)\n迷城 (pg92Li.cdbrQ7)\n依恋 (pZQA70.cFzO30)\n慢夜 (pAQPSN.CcF9N3)\nindus credit card (indus.credit.card)\nIndusind Card (com.rewardz.card)\nThere is no evidence that these apps are distributed to Google Play. Rather, the main propagation vector involves tricking users into clicking on bogus links sent via messaging apps that redirect unwitting recipients to unofficial app stores.\nIn one example highlighted by McAfee, the app masquerades as an Indian financial institution to gather users' sensitive information, including full names, mobile numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, residential addresses, credit card numbers, and government-issued identifiers.\nAnother app mimics the social media site X to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos from victim devices. The app primarily targets Chinese-speaking users via third-party websites or alternative app stores.\nBesides using encrypted socket communication to transmit harvested data to a command-and-control (C2) server, the malware has been observed including several meaningless permissions to the AndroidManifest.xml file (e.g., \"android.permission.LhSSzIw6q\") in an attempt to break analysis tools.\nAlso used to remain undetected is a technique called multi-stage dynamic loading, which makes use of an XOR-encrypted loader responsible for launching an AES-encrypted payload that, in turn, loads .NET MAUI assemblies designed to execute the malware.\n\"The main payload is ultimately hidden within the C# code,\" Shin said. \"When the user interacts with the app, such as pressing a button, the malware silently steals their data and sends it to the C2 server.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The threat actor first emerged publicly on December 4, 2020, operating under the aliases ALTDOS, mystic251, DESORDEN, GHOSTR, and 0mid16B.\nThe attacks involved the use of SQL injection tools, such as SQLmap, to gain access to sensitive data, followed by deploying Cobalt Strike Beacons to maintain persistent control over compromised hosts.\n\"He targeted internet-facing Windows servers, specifically searching for databases that contained personal information,\" Group-IB\nsaid\nin a report detailing the threat actor's modus operandi. \"After compromising these servers, he exfiltrated the victim's data and, in some cases, encrypted it on the compromised servers.\"\nThe end goal of these attacks was financial gain, pressurizing victims into either paying a ransom or risking public exposure of their confidential data. Several entities from Bangladesh, Canada, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, and the U.S. had their data leaked on dark web forums like CryptBB, RaidForums, and BreachForums.\n\"One persistent detail across all four of his aliases was his method of publishing stolen data screenshots,\" Group-IB researchers noted. \"Regardless of his rebranding, he consistently uploaded images directly from the same device, revealing a key operational fingerprint.\"\nThe development also\nfollows\nthe arrest of nearly a dozen Chinese nationals who have been accused of perpetrating a new type of tap-to-pay fraud that involves using stolen credit card information to purchase gift cards and launder funds.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "New Android malware campaigns use Microsoft's cross-platform framework .NET MAUI while disguising as legitimate services to evade detection.\nThe tactic was observed by McAfee's Mobile Research Team, a member of the App Defense Alliance dedicated to enhancing Android security.\nAlthough the apps McAfee observed target users in China and India, uncovering the attacks is important as the targeting scope could broaden, and the same tactic may be adopted by other cybercriminals soon.\nUsing .NET MAUI on Android\nLaunched in 2022, .NET MAUI is an app development framework in C#, introduced by Microsoft as a replacement to Xamarin, supporting both desktop and mobile platforms.\nTypically, Android apps are written in Java/Kotlin and store the code in DEX format, but it's technically possible to use .NET MAUI to build an Android app in C# with the app's logic stored inside binary blob files.\nContemporary Android security tools are designed to scan DEX files for suspicious logic and do not examine blob files. This allows threat actors to hide malicious code in the blobs and bypass detection.\nThis approach is even more preferable than fetching malicious code post-installation via updates, which is the standard tactic with most Android malware nowadays.\nIn this case, the tactic is effective because C#-based apps and blob files on Android are obscure.\nApart from using .NET MAUI, the campaigns observed by McAffee use multi-layered encryption (XOR + AES) and staged execution, 'AndroidManifest.xml' file bloating with randomly generated strings, and TCP socket for command-and-control (C2) communications.\n\"With these evasion techniques, the threats can remain hidden for long periods, making analysis and detection significantly more challenging,\"\nwarns McAfee\n.\n\"Furthermore, the discovery of multiple variants using the same core techniques suggests that this type of malware is becoming increasingly common.\"\nFake X apps steal data\nMcAfee discovered several APKs in its report as part of the campaigns using the .NET MAUI technique, including fake banking, communication, dating, and social media apps such as X.\nFake X app\n​​​​​Source: McAfee​​\nThe researchers used two apps as examples, IndusInd and SNS, which are distributed outside Google Play, Android's official app store.\n\"In China, where access to the Google Play Store is restricted, such apps are often distributed through third-party websites or alternative app stores,\" explains McAfee.\n\"This allows attackers to spread their malware more easily, especially in regions with limited access to official app stores.\"\nIn the first case, the app impersonates an Indian bank, prompting users to input sensitive personal and financial information, and exfiltrating it to the C2 server.\nExfiltrating data to the C2 server\nSource: McAfee\nIn the SNS app case, which targets Chinese-speaking users, the app attempts to steal contact lists, SMS messages, and photos stored on the device.\nStealing SMS, images, and contacts\nSource: McAfee\nTo minimize the risk of infection by these evasive malware apps, avoid downloading Android APKs from third-party app stores or obscure websites and avoid clicking on links received via SMS or email.\nIf you are in regions where Google Play is unavailable, scan APKs for malicious signs and only install them from trusted sites.\nGoogle Play Protect can detect and block the APKs McAfee identified as part of the latest campaigns, so ensure it's active on your device.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMalicious Android 'Vapor' apps on Google Play installed 60 million times\nSpyLend Android malware downloaded 100,000 times from Google Play\nCrypto-stealing apps found in Apple App Store for the first time\nNew North Korean Android spyware slips onto Google Play\nBadBox malware disrupted on 500K infected Android devices"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nWeaver Ant, a cyberespionage-focused APT operating out of China, is targeting telecom providers for persistent access.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nCyber response firm Sygnia warns of a newly identified China-linked APT that relies on web shells for persistent access to telecommunications providers, for cyberespionage purposes.\nTracked as Weaver Ant, the threat actor was uncovered during the investigation into the hacking of a telecom provider in Asia, after a compromised account that had been disabled during remediation was re-enabled from an internal server.\n\n\n\nThe server had been compromised for years, and was infected with a China Chopper web shell, providing the threat actor with remote access and control over the system. Despite eradication efforts, Weaver Ant maintained access to the server for four years, adapting its techniques to changes in the environment.\n\n\n\nSygnia’s investigation led to the discovery of multiple web shells (PDF), including a China Chopper variant that supports AES encryption of the payload, capable of bypassing automated detection mechanisms, and a previously unseen web shell dubbed INMemory, which supports the in-memory execution of payloads.\n\n\n\n“Deployed primarily on externally facing servers, the encrypted China Chopper web shell was implemented in various programming languages, including ASPX and PHP. The compromised servers served as entry points, enabling the threat actor to infiltrate the victim’s network and establish persistent access,” Sygnia explains.\n\n\n\nThe analyzed China Chopper variant features keyword-based evasion, where keywords used as parameters names in the payload field resulted in firewalls automatically redacting the values in logs, and payload truncation, where the size of the payload was larger than the character limit supported by the firewall.\n\n\n\nINMemory was observed decoding a hardcoded string into a portable executable and executing it entirely in memory, for detection evasion. It also uses Base64-encoded strings to obfuscate code and further evade detection.\n\n\n\nAfter determining that Weaver Ant was still operating within the compromised network, Sygnia implemented stealth monitoring consisting of port mirroring and the automated decryption of tunneled web shell traffic, uncovering multiple payloads and persistence mechanisms on tens of servers.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\n“The threat actor deployed minimalist web shells on compromised machines – often consisting of just a single line of code, such as a modified version of China Chopper – the web shells served merely as conduits for executing more sophisticated payloads to achieve the actual objectives,” Sygnia explains.\n\n\n\nWeaver Ant was also seen deploying a recursive HTTP tunnel tool that operated as a ‘second stage’ web shell, enabling access to internal resources, forwarding requests to other web shells, and constructing and executing cURL commands.\n\n\n\nUsing web shells as proxy servers “enabled Weaver Ant to operate on servers within different network segments – typically internal servers not directly connected to the internet- by leveraging existing publicly accessible servers as operational gateways,” Sygnia says.\n\n\n\nThe cybersecurity firm also discovered that payloads were “encapsulated in multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation”, being passed from a web shell to another, which used hardcoded keys to peel off the layers one-by-one.\n\n\n\nThe threat actor was also observed patching event tracing processes to suppress critical logs, and overwrote the AmsiScanBuffer function to render Antimalware Scan Interface integrations ineffective and ensure malicious PowerShell commands could be executed.\n\n\n\nWeaver Ant leveraged a Windows module to execute PowerShell commands without launching the PowerShell process, and perform reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data exfiltration preparations. It also used the Invoke-SMBClient PowerShell module to interact with SMB shares, for lateral movement.\n\n\n\n“Invoke-SMBClient was executed using valid credentials, leveraging high-privileged local or domain accounts with passwords that had not been rotated for years. Instead of clear-text passwords, the threat actor used NTLM hashes to invoke the tool,” Sygnia says.\n\n\n\nThe cybersecurity firm attributes the activity to a Chinese APT, based on tooling, techniques, and the attack times, noting that Chinese threat actors typically share tools among them, and that a different APT group may have planted false flags to prevent attribution.\n\n\n\nRelated: China’s Volt Typhoon Hackers Dwelled in US Electric Grid for 300 Days\nRelated: How China Pinned University Cyberattacks on NSA Hackers\nRelated: FCC Taking Action in Response to China’s Telecoms Hacking\nRelated: T-Mobile Shares More Information on China-Linked Cyberattack\n\nTracked as Weaver Ant, the threat actor was uncovered during the investigation into the hacking of a telecom provider in Asia, after a compromised account that had been disabled during remediation was re-enabled from an internal server.\n\n\n\nThe server had been compromised for years, and was infected with a China Chopper web shell, providing the threat actor with remote access and control over the system.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nThreats themselves change very little, but the tactics used are continually revised to maximize the criminals’ return on investment and effort.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nAnalysis of threats detected in the latter half of 2024, demonstrates that attackers evolve rather than abandon their primary targets and tactics.\nA study by researchers at Ontinue describes four major evolutionary trends: malware delivery via browser extensions and malvertising; more advanced phishing and vishing techniques; increasing attacks against IoT and OT devices; and the continuing evolution of ransomware.\n\n\n\nRansomware is noteworthy. Ontinue explains (PDF) that ransom payments decreased: from $1.25 billion in 2023 to $813.5 million in 2024. But while the payments received by criminals went down, the number of reported breaches went up. “This could indicate that ransomware groups are conducting more attacks to compensate for lower ransom success rates,” suggests Ontinue.\n\n\n\nThe primary motivating factor for ransomware is the money it generates. Apparently, more victims are declining to pay – but it is equally apparent that criminals are not ready to abandon this type of attack. “The decrease in payments might also push attackers to diversify their methods further. For example, we could see more focus on supply chain attacks or targeting critical infrastructure, where the stakes – and the potential payouts – are higher,” comments Casey Ellis, Founder at Bugcrowd.\n\n\n\nThe critical infrastructure may be unable to refuse payment. Ngoc Bui, cybersecurity expert at Menlo Security, adds, “While paying ransoms might incentivize threat actors, the reality is not paying could be more damaging – especially for organizations involved in critical infrastructure. The disruption from ransomware can be catastrophic, and organizations must prioritize protecting operations and stakeholders.”\n\n\n\nAnd while all this is happening, the ransomware gangs are fine-tuning their tactics, “to include interactions with IT teams to elicit information to improve access, SaaS-based attacks, and even studying file-transfer technology for rapid exploitation and double extortion methods,” says Nathaniel Jones, VP of threat research at Darktrace.\n\n\n\nSo, while ransom payments may have decreased last year, the ransomware threat is not decreasing, just evolving.\n\n\n\nMalware delivery via the browser is a trend also noted by Menlo Security. Ontinue highlights the threat of infection via browser extensions, which are being exploited to deliver information-stealing malware. “This method is particularly effective,” warn the researchers, “because the malicious extensions can persist even after a system is reimaged. Users often unknowingly reintroduce the threat by reimporting their browser profiles, including the infected extensions, during the recovery process.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nPhishing and vishing are increasing in both volume and sophistication. This has been expected once criminals learn to understand and use gen-AI, which is almost tailor-made for social engineering.\n\n\n\nOn phishing, Ontinue has detected three trends: using legitimate sites for the first landing page, which then redirect the victims to a malicious domain; using ‘no reply’ sender addresses to hide the attacker from security checks; and using obscure variations of big name domains (such as those from google.com, apple.com and bing.com) to redirect victims to AiTM sites.\n\n\n\nVishing attacks are becoming more prevalent, growing by 1,633%. Vishing bypasses the automated security filters that email phishing needs to navigate – and has been given a huge boost by AI. “By utilizing AI-driven voice cloning technologies,” explain the Ontinue researchers, “cybercriminals can create highly realistic audio deepfakes, impersonating trusted individuals to deceive victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring funds.”\n\n\n\nIt’s down to the individual user to counter the vishing threat in conformance with strict user policies. Absent such formal policies, J Stephen Kowski, field CTO at SlashNext, adds, “Individuals should never share personal information during unexpected calls, even if the caller seems legitimate. Always verify the caller’s identity by hanging up and calling back through official numbers found on websites or statements.”\n\n\n\nIncreasing attacks against IoT and OT devices are primarily because they are traditionally less well defended than pure IT devices, and because of their potential to provide both ransomware and nation state attackers access to much of the critical infrastructure. \n\n\n\n“When IoT devices are built down to a price, their firmware is often built down to a price, too,” say the researchers. “IoT web services, for example, often rely on stripped-down networking software that runs with root privilege and performs its configuration operations simply by passing user-supplied data to the system via a command shell.”\n\n\n\nThis, they add, “makes IoT devices notoriously vulnerable to command injection, remote code execution, and privilege escalation attacks.” IoT devices are often built for consumers, but the growing practice of working from home, either full-time or part-time, brings these devices into close contact with the means to cross over into company systems.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, all OT devices lack the depth of security offered to IT devices, and often lag in patching. Concerns over water facilities illustrate the issues. “The U.S. government warned of misconfigured infrastructure control systems in water facilities,” comments the report. “Pro-Russian actors were reportedly able to alter pumping parameters, disable alarms, and lock operators out of their systems.”\n\n\n\nAn OIG report in November 2024 found 97 water systems serving about 27 million people contained critical and high severity issues.\n\n\n\nIn December 2024, CISA and the EPA urged water companies to ensure their OT HMI systems were properly secured. “Threat actors have demonstrated the capability to find and exploit internet-exposed HMIs with cybersecurity weaknesses easily. For example, in 2024, pro-Russia hacktivists manipulated HMIs at water and wastewater systems, causing water pumps and blower equipment to exceed their normal operating parameters,” the two agencies said.\n\n\n\nThe Ontinue threat report demonstrates that cyberattacks ebb and flow – the ebb is generally while new tactics and methods and technologies are explored, while the flow is the continuous, and generally increasing, nature of cybercriminality. The threats themselves change very little, but the tactics used are continually revised to maximize the criminals’ return on investment and effort.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Cyber Threat Intelligence\nRelated: Medusa Ransomware Made 300 Critical Infrastructure Victims\nRelated: Scareware Combined With Phishing in Attacks Targeting macOS Users\nRelated: New FrigidStealer macOS Malware Distributed as Fake Browser Update\n\nA study by researchers at Ontinue describes four major evolutionary trends: malware delivery via browser extensions and malvertising; more advanced phishing and vishing techniques; increasing attacks against IoT and OT devices; and the continuing evolution of ransomware.\n\n\n\nRansomware is noteworthy.

Always verify the caller’s identity by hanging up and calling back through official numbers found on websites or statements.”\n\n\n\nIncreasing attacks against IoT and OT devices are primarily because they are traditionally less well defended than pure IT devices, and because of their potential to provide both ransomware and nation state attackers access to much of the critical infrastructure. \n\n\n\n“When IoT devices are built down to a price, their firmware is often built down to a price, too,” say the researchers. “IoT web services, for example, often rely on stripped-down networking software that runs with root privilege and performs its configuration operations simply by passing user-supplied data to the system via a command shell.”\n\n\n\nThis, they add, “makes IoT devices notoriously vulnerable to command injection, remote code execution, and privilege escalation attacks.” IoT devices are often built for consumers, but the growing practice of working from home, either full-time or part-time, brings these devices into close contact with the means to cross over into company systems.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, all OT devices lack the depth of security offered to IT devices, and often lag in patching. Concerns over water facilities illustrate the issues. “The U.S. government warned of misconfigured infrastructure control systems in water facilities,” comments the report. “Pro-Russian actors were reportedly able to alter pumping parameters, disable alarms, and lock operators out of their systems.”\n\n\n\nAn OIG report in November 2024 found 97 water systems serving about 27 million people contained critical and high severity issues.\n\n\n\nIn December 2024, CISA and the EPA urged water companies to ensure their OT HMI systems were properly secured. “Threat actors have demonstrated the capability to find and exploit internet-exposed HMIs with cybersecurity weaknesses easily. For example, in 2024, pro-Russia hacktivists manipulated HMIs at water and wastewater systems, causing water pumps and blower equipment to exceed their normal operating parameters,” the two agencies said.\n\n\n\nThe Ontinue threat report demonstrates that cyberattacks ebb and flow – the ebb is generally while new tactics and methods and technologies are explored, while the flow is the continuous, and generally increasing, nature of cybercriminality. The threats themselves change very little, but the tactics used are continually revised to maximize the criminals’ return on investment and effort.\n\n\n\nRelated: Cyber Insights 2025: Cyber Threat Intelligence\nRelated: Medusa Ransomware Made 300 Critical Infrastructure Victims\nRelated: Scareware Combined With Phishing in Attacks Targeting macOS Users\nRelated: New FrigidStealer macOS Malware Distributed as Fake Browser Update\n\nThe primary motivating factor for ransomware is the money it generates. Apparently, more victims are declining to pay – but it is equally apparent that criminals are not ready to abandon this type of attack. “The decrease in payments might also push attackers to diversify their methods further. For example, we could see more focus on supply chain attacks or targeting critical infrastructure, where the stakes – and the potential payouts – are higher,” comments Casey Ellis, Founder at Bugcrowd.\n\n\n\nThe critical infrastructure may be unable to refuse payment. Ngoc Bui, cybersecurity expert at Menlo Security, adds, “While paying ransoms might incentivize threat actors, the reality is not paying could be more damaging – especially for organizations involved in critical infrastructure. The disruption from ransomware can be catastrophic, and organizations must prioritize protecting operations and stakeholders.”\n\n\n\nAnd while all this is happening, the ransomware gangs are fine-tuning their tactics, “to include interactions with IT teams to elicit information to improve access, SaaS-based attacks, and even studying file-transfer technology for rapid exploitation and double extortion methods,” says Nathaniel Jones, VP of threat research at Darktrace.\n\n\n\nSo, while ransom payments may have decreased last year, the ransomware threat is not decreasing, just evolving.\n\n\n\nMalware delivery via the browser is a trend also noted by Menlo Security. Ontinue highlights the threat of infection via browser extensions, which are being exploited to deliver information-stealing malware. “This method is particularly effective,” warn the researchers, “because the malicious extensions can persist even after a system is reimaged. Users often unknowingly reintroduce the threat by reimporting their browser profiles, including the infected extensions, during the recovery process.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nPhishing and vishing are increasing in both volume and sophistication. This has been expected once criminals learn to understand and use gen-AI, which is almost tailor-made for social engineering.\n\n\n\nOn phishing, Ontinue has detected three trends: using legitimate sites for the first landing page, which then redirect the victims to a malicious domain; using ‘no reply’ sender addresses to hide the attacker from security checks; and using obscure variations of big name domains (such as those from google.com, apple.com and bing.com) to redirect victims to AiTM sites.\n\n\n\nVishing attacks are becoming more prevalent, growing by 1,633%.

Absent such formal policies, J Stephen Kowski, field CTO at SlashNext, adds, “Individuals should never share personal information during unexpected calls, even if the caller seems legitimate. Always verify the caller’s identity by hanging up and calling back through official numbers found on websites or statements.”\n\n\n\nIncreasing attacks against IoT and OT devices are primarily because they are traditionally less well defended than pure IT devices, and because of their potential to provide both ransomware and nation state attackers access to much of the critical infrastructure. \n\n\n\n“When IoT devices are built down to a price, their firmware is often built down to a price, too,” say the researchers. “IoT web services, for example, often rely on stripped-down networking software that runs with root privilege and performs its configuration operations simply by passing user-supplied data to the system via a command shell.”\n\n\n\nThis, they add, “makes IoT devices notoriously vulnerable to command injection, remote code execution, and privilege escalation attacks.” IoT devices are often built for consumers, but the growing practice of working from home, either full-time or part-time, brings these devices into close contact with the means to cross over into company systems.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, all OT devices lack the depth of security offered to IT devices, and often lag in patching. Concerns over water facilities illustrate the issues. “The U.S. government warned of misconfigured infrastructure control systems in water facilities,” comments the report. “Pro-Russian actors were reportedly able to alter pumping parameters, disable alarms, and lock operators out of their systems.”\n\n\n\nAn OIG report in November 2024 found 97 water systems serving about 27 million people contained critical and high severity issues.\n\n\n\nIn December 2024, CISA and the EPA urged water companies to ensure their OT HMI systems were properly secured. “Threat actors have demonstrated the capability to find and exploit internet-exposed HMIs with cybersecurity weaknesses easily. For example, in 2024, pro-Russia hacktivists manipulated HMIs at water and wastewater systems, causing water pumps and blower equipment to exceed their normal operating parameters,” the two agencies said.\n\n\n\nThe Ontinue threat report demonstrates that cyberattacks ebb and flow – the ebb is generally while new tactics and methods and technologies are explored, while the flow is the continuous, and generally increasing, nature of cybercriminality.

Early pranks sometimes leading to something more serious.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nThe history of Frank Trezza is not unusual among hackers – from a young prankster through growing exploration of potential attacking powers to a mature defender of security. In this edition of Hacker Conversations, we follow his path.\nSecuritWeek’s Hacker Conversations series discusses the mind and motivations of hackers. Many, like Trezza, have become important figures in today’s cybersecurity defense. To defend computers, it is useful to know how to attack them – and that’s where being a hacker becomes valuable.\n\n\n\nWhat is a hacker\nThe fundamental characteristic of being a hacker is common to all hackers: it is based on a drive to understand how things work. If we consider the term ‘hacker’ as a genus, a computer hacker is a species of the genus hacker. Other hackers could belong to other species such as lifehackers, locksmiths, music hackers, and mind hackers (psychologists for the theory and psychiatrists for the function). The list is effectively limitless.\n\n\n\nHere we are solely interested in the computer hacker species. There are numerous sub-species that are usually classified by motivation and choice using additional epithets: such as ‘blackhat’, ‘whitehat’, ‘ethical’, and ‘pentester’. In this series we apply no moral score to the motivations that create the sub-species, but we do sometimes seek to understand individual choices – which can include moral virtue or turpitude, financial or social background, and geopolitical influence. \n\n\n\nTo complicate this scenario, one hacker can belong to several sub-species simultaneously – like the frustrated ethical hacker whose discovered vulnerabilities are ignored by the vendor and consequently decides to distribute, or even sell, those vulnerabilities on the dark web. \n\n\n\nA further complication is that being a hacker does not require knowledge that you are a hacker (although that usually becomes self-evident as years go by). Frank Trezza, today’s subject, is an example of the latter. He started hacking when he was about nine years old; but he didn’t realize he was a hacker for another five years. All he knew at age nine was that you could do fun additional things with this new stuff called technology. And he learned this from an older brother and their mutual love of the new computer games.\n\n\n\nEarly video gaming was the entrée into hacking for many youngsters thirty years ago. The games were so expensive, not all friends had a copy, and they didn’t necessarily do what you wanted them to do. And as gaming and playing and chatting with multiple friends migrated onto the nascent internet, everything became way too expensive with the additional telephone costs.\n\n\n\nKnowing you’re a hacker\n“Let’s say I wanted to play Wolfenstein with a friend, and he didn’t have a copy,” explained Trezza. “I learned how to take the game that I bought and compress it onto a small disc so that I could share it with him, and he could play it with me.” He was still only around ten years old.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nTechnically, this may have been ‘hacking’, but Trezza wasn’t aware of this. He had an ability that enabled him to share his own opportunities with others, and he did this. This desire to share the benefits he enjoyed with others perhaps less fortunate is a latent and innate influence within his persona.\n\n\n\n“I wouldn’t have considered myself an actual hacker until I was maybe 14 or 15 years old. I had a desire to get on the internet, but not the money to do so. I had to figure out alternative ways of getting online. That was probably the first actual hacking, where I was intentionally bypassing security mechanisms put in place so that I could get access to the internet. At that time, dial-up was very expensive, which led me to learn about phreaking.”\n\n\n\nPhreaking (freaking the phone) is a common factor in the evolution of almost all first generation hackers. Natural hackers with the innate desire to share need to talk to other hackers. Technology provided this opportunity through the early internet and bulletin boards (BBs); but priced it beyond their reach. Hacking the phone system was largely considered an acceptable way of achieving desired ends without (usually) harming anyone other than the big comms companies.\n\n\n\nTrezza described one method he used: “As a kid of 14, I realized AOL had an 800 number you could call, and they charged you a lot of money to use that 800 number – but you didn’t get a separate phone bill for its use. I also realized that when you signed up, they didn’t check the credit card you used until a month later, provided it conformed to the expected algorithm [the Luhn algorithmic verification of the card’s check digit]. So, I could generate a credit card, give it to them and have free use of that 800 number for a month. My parents weren’t going to get a bill, and I wasn’t going to get in trouble for it. Okay, AOL would get stiffed on those hours, but they were a major corporation, and, aged 14, ethically I didn’t see anything wrong with that.”\n\n\n\nWith access to bulletin boards, his access to learning increased. He also began going to local meetups in New York City and the 2600 crew. “I hung out with people like Emmanuel Goldstein and Rob T Firefly,” he continued. Emmanuel Goldstein, a character from the dystopian novel 1984 is / was the handle of Eric Corley; while Rob T Firefly, from the sci-fi Firefly television series, is / was the name used by Rob Vincent. Both are still active with 2600 and the HOPE (Hackers on Planet Earth) conference.\n\n\n\nPranks and law enforcement\nThe process of growing up is invariably one of testing limits (usually personal) and pushing boundaries (usually societal). Young hackers have unusual abilities with unusual consequences; and the evolutionary process for them is equally unusual. It generally starts with technological pranks and evolves into something more complex and sometimes more serious. Frank Trezza was no different.\n\n\n\nOne example of an early prank involved phones. “Me and my friends would change the level of service of somebody’s phone, so that when their parents would pick up the phone to make a phone call from their house, it would say, ‘Please insert 25 cents or 50 cents’ to make this call – because as far as the phone company was concerned, that phone was now a pay phone. Nobody could make any outbound phone calls. It was a prank, but it was a difficult thing to get resolved because the phone company could rarely figure out how that happened.”\n\n\n\nAs skills evolve and young hackers get older, those pranks might also become something less likely to be funny. “Yeah, I did a few stupid things,” he said. “I never ended up in jail, but I did have a few visits from the police. Luckily, they didn’t really have the knowledge or understanding to prosecute that type of crime back then – but I did some stupid things. I have a sealed record as a result, and I’m not too proud of some of the stupid things I did. But really, there are not too many of us that are proud of all the things we did when we were kids. I got in trouble a few times.”\n\n\n\nAs he matured, the common amoral attitude of the youngster began to change. These jokes may have real and unwelcome consequences. He gave an example. It may not have been an epiphanous moment, but it does demonstrate his increasing awareness of the potential harm of hacking for fun.\n\n\n\n“When I was young, I worked for a big retail firm. They hired me and I worked for about three months before I found out they would be laying off me and the others hired at the same time. It seemed that they did this to avoid having to provide health insurance. Then they’d hire another batch of kids for three months. This didn’t sit well with me,” he explained.\n\n\n\n“I understood their elementary computer and payment system; and I had a very low opinion of the manager who was about to fire me. So, I bought a router and set its priority to be the primary router that would provide the IP addresses and DHCP information to all the other devices. I took the label printer and put the manager’s name on it, and then put the router in a network closet. I knew that over time, after I got laid off, it would cause chaos. All the computers on the network would begin to connect to this router to get their information, and they wouldn’t be able to connect to the system they were designed to talk to. When they did work out what was wrong, the manager who unjustly fired me would get the blame.”\n\n\n\nIt was done in a fit of righteous justification. But Trezza soon had regrets. “I’m not very proud of having done that,” he continued. “I think it was a very impulsive thing I did as a kid, and that guy ended up losing his job because of it. I felt like I was justified at the time. I was working with the mindset of a child and seeing things in a very black and white way, missing the nuances involved. That guy could have had a wife and a family, and he might have just been doing what he was told to do from the top, you know, following orders.”\n\n\n\nThis is part of the process of growing up – from seeing things in black and white as a child, to beginning to understand the wider implications of actions. Through this process, Trezza began to focus on using his skills to protect rather than manipulate. It is a process that is common to many hackers.\n\n\n\nNeurodiversity and moral compass\nThere’s an interesting conjecture around this type of moral evolution. He, like most other hackers in this series, is neurodiverse – or more specifically, ADHD and / or Aspergers. The well-known ASD capacity for long periods of hyperfocus coupled with a tendency to ‘think outside the box’ is an obvious boon (but not necessarily a requirement) for hacking. \n\n\n\nTrezza believes his neurodiversity has helped his hacker career while simultaneously introducing some difficulties. “I believe it brings a heightened attention to detail, pattern recognition, and logical thinking – key assets in cybersecurity. However, it also comes with challenges, particularly in social interactions and communication, which are important in client-facing roles or collaborative environments. For example, I’ve had to work consciously on refining my interpersonal communication, whether when explaining technical issues to clients or navigating team dynamics. It’s not always intuitive, but understanding these challenges has helped me develop coping strategies and maintain strong working relationships.”\n\n\n\nHe takes inspiration from Christopher Hitchens: “The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks;” and “Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.” Entirely separately, research published in May 2024 (Moral foundations in autistic people and people with systemizing minds) finds a statistically relevant “preference by autistic people for Fairness over Care, and their attraction to libertarian politics”.\n\n\n\nNow relate this last statement to Trezza’s own evolution. His early childhood hacking exploits were distinctly ‘amoral’ or lacking in ‘care’. But there was always an element of fairness (for example in wishing to share his gaming opportunities with childhood friends who had no such opportunities).\n\n\n\nFast forward to the episode with the router and being ‘unfairly’ dismissed. His immediate reaction lacked care – but was later colored by the idea that perhaps he had also been ‘unfair’ to the manager who fired him. It is tempting to think that Trezza’s moral compass has been affected by the growing dominance of ‘fairness’ over ‘lack of care’ as he matured. \n\n\n\nWhether this has anything to do with neurodiversity is unproven – but the process is probably accurate. It even includes libertarian attitudes. Among other employment, Trezza is currently CISO at Atheists for Liberty. “This reflects my dedication to promoting open dialogue and standing up for principles related to freedom, individual rights, and rational thought – values that align with my ethical stance on hacking,” he said. \n\n\n\nAnd now…\nFrank Trezza is fairly typical of most hackers. Early pranks sometimes leading to something more serious – the things he’s not proud of – but ultimately evolving into a strong ethical position on using skills to protect rather than harm security. Apart from being CISO at Atheists for Liberty, he now has his own independent pentesting firm, and also has a day job with a Fortune 500 company where, he says, “I do a little bit of penetration testing, but primarily I’m more focused on securing the external attack surface than I am actually penetrating their systems.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Joe Grand – Mischiefmaker, Troublemaker, Teacher\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Tom Anthony and Scratching an Itch Without Doing Harm\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Chris Evans, Hacker and CISO\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: HD Moore and the Line Between Black and White\n\nSecuritWeek’s Hacker Conversations series discusses the mind and motivations of hackers.

To defend computers, it is useful to know how to attack them – and that’s where being a hacker becomes valuable.\n\n\n\nWhat is a hacker\nThe fundamental characteristic of being a hacker is common to all hackers: it is based on a drive to understand how things work. If we consider the term ‘hacker’ as a genus, a computer hacker is a species of the genus hacker. Other hackers could belong to other species such as lifehackers, locksmiths, music hackers, and mind hackers (psychologists for the theory and psychiatrists for the function). The list is effectively limitless.\n\n\n\nHere we are solely interested in the computer hacker species. There are numerous sub-species that are usually classified by motivation and choice using additional epithets: such as ‘blackhat’, ‘whitehat’, ‘ethical’, and ‘pentester’. In this series we apply no moral score to the motivations that create the sub-species, but we do sometimes seek to understand individual choices – which can include moral virtue or turpitude, financial or social background, and geopolitical influence. \n\n\n\nTo complicate this scenario, one hacker can belong to several sub-species simultaneously – like the frustrated ethical hacker whose discovered vulnerabilities are ignored by the vendor and consequently decides to distribute, or even sell, those vulnerabilities on the dark web. \n\n\n\nA further complication is that being a hacker does not require knowledge that you are a hacker (although that usually becomes self-evident as years go by). Frank Trezza, today’s subject, is an example of the latter. He started hacking when he was about nine years old; but he didn’t realize he was a hacker for another five years. All he knew at age nine was that you could do fun additional things with this new stuff called technology. And he learned this from an older brother and their mutual love of the new computer games.\n\n\n\nEarly video gaming was the entrée into hacking for many youngsters thirty years ago. The games were so expensive, not all friends had a copy, and they didn’t necessarily do what you wanted them to do. And as gaming and playing and chatting with multiple friends migrated onto the nascent internet, everything became way too expensive with the additional telephone costs.\n\n\n\nKnowing you’re a hacker\n“Let’s say I wanted to play Wolfenstein with a friend, and he didn’t have a copy,” explained Trezza. “I learned how to take the game that I bought and compress it onto a small disc so that I could share it with him, and he could play it with me.” He was still only around ten years old.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nTechnically, this may have been ‘hacking’, but Trezza wasn’t aware of this. He had an ability that enabled him to share his own opportunities with others, and he did this. This desire to share the benefits he enjoyed with others perhaps less fortunate is a latent and innate influence within his persona.\n\n\n\n“I wouldn’t have considered myself an actual hacker until I was maybe 14 or 15 years old. I had a desire to get on the internet, but not the money to do so. I had to figure out alternative ways of getting online. That was probably the first actual hacking, where I was intentionally bypassing security mechanisms put in place so that I could get access to the internet. At that time, dial-up was very expensive, which led me to learn about phreaking.”\n\n\n\nPhreaking (freaking the phone) is a common factor in the evolution of almost all first generation hackers. Natural hackers with the innate desire to share need to talk to other hackers. Technology provided this opportunity through the early internet and bulletin boards (BBs); but priced it beyond their reach. Hacking the phone system was largely considered an acceptable way of achieving desired ends without (usually) harming anyone other than the big comms companies.\n\n\n\nTrezza described one method he used: “As a kid of 14, I realized AOL had an 800 number you could call, and they charged you a lot of money to use that 800 number – but you didn’t get a separate phone bill for its use. I also realized that when you signed up, they didn’t check the credit card you used until a month later, provided it conformed to the expected algorithm [the Luhn algorithmic verification of the card’s check digit]. So, I could generate a credit card, give it to them and have free use of that 800 number for a month. My parents weren’t going to get a bill, and I wasn’t going to get in trouble for it. Okay, AOL would get stiffed on those hours, but they were a major corporation, and, aged 14, ethically I didn’t see anything wrong with that.”\n\n\n\nWith access to bulletin boards, his access to learning increased. He also began going to local meetups in New York City and the 2600 crew. “I hung out with people like Emmanuel Goldstein and Rob T Firefly,” he continued. Emmanuel Goldstein, a character from the dystopian novel 1984 is / was the handle of Eric Corley; while Rob T Firefly, from the sci-fi Firefly television series, is / was the name used by Rob Vincent. Both are still active with 2600 and the HOPE (Hackers on Planet Earth) conference.\n\n\n\nPranks and law enforcement\nThe process of growing up is invariably one of testing limits (usually personal) and pushing boundaries (usually societal). Young hackers have unusual abilities with unusual consequences; and the evolutionary process for them is equally unusual. It generally starts with technological pranks and evolves into something more complex and sometimes more serious. Frank Trezza was no different.\n\n\n\nOne example of an early prank involved phones. “Me and my friends would change the level of service of somebody’s phone, so that when their parents would pick up the phone to make a phone call from their house, it would say, ‘Please insert 25 cents or 50 cents’ to make this call – because as far as the phone company was concerned, that phone was now a pay phone. Nobody could make any outbound phone calls. It was a prank, but it was a difficult thing to get resolved because the phone company could rarely figure out how that happened.”\n\n\n\nAs skills evolve and young hackers get older, those pranks might also become something less likely to be funny. “Yeah, I did a few stupid things,” he said. “I never ended up in jail, but I did have a few visits from the police. Luckily, they didn’t really have the knowledge or understanding to prosecute that type of crime back then – but I did some stupid things. I have a sealed record as a result, and I’m not too proud of some of the stupid things I did. But really, there are not too many of us that are proud of all the things we did when we were kids. I got in trouble a few times.”\n\n\n\nAs he matured, the common amoral attitude of the youngster began to change. These jokes may have real and unwelcome consequences. He gave an example. It may not have been an epiphanous moment, but it does demonstrate his increasing awareness of the potential harm of hacking for fun.\n\n\n\n“When I was young, I worked for a big retail firm. They hired me and I worked for about three months before I found out they would be laying off me and the others hired at the same time. It seemed that they did this to avoid having to provide health insurance. Then they’d hire another batch of kids for three months. This didn’t sit well with me,” he explained.\n\n\n\n“I understood their elementary computer and payment system; and I had a very low opinion of the manager who was about to fire me. So, I bought a router and set its priority to be the primary router that would provide the IP addresses and DHCP information to all the other devices. I took the label printer and put the manager’s name on it, and then put the router in a network closet. I knew that over time, after I got laid off, it would cause chaos. All the computers on the network would begin to connect to this router to get their information, and they wouldn’t be able to connect to the system they were designed to talk to. When they did work out what was wrong, the manager who unjustly fired me would get the blame.”\n\n\n\nIt was done in a fit of righteous justification. But Trezza soon had regrets. “I’m not very proud of having done that,” he continued. “I think it was a very impulsive thing I did as a kid, and that guy ended up losing his job because of it. I felt like I was justified at the time. I was working with the mindset of a child and seeing things in a very black and white way, missing the nuances involved. That guy could have had a wife and a family, and he might have just been doing what he was told to do from the top, you know, following orders.”\n\n\n\nThis is part of the process of growing up – from seeing things in black and white as a child, to beginning to understand the wider implications of actions. Through this process, Trezza began to focus on using his skills to protect rather than manipulate. It is a process that is common to many hackers.\n\n\n\nNeurodiversity and moral compass\nThere’s an interesting conjecture around this type of moral evolution. He, like most other hackers in this series, is neurodiverse – or more specifically, ADHD and / or Aspergers. The well-known ASD capacity for long periods of hyperfocus coupled with a tendency to ‘think outside the box’ is an obvious boon (but not necessarily a requirement) for hacking. \n\n\n\nTrezza believes his neurodiversity has helped his hacker career while simultaneously introducing some difficulties. “I believe it brings a heightened attention to detail, pattern recognition, and logical thinking – key assets in cybersecurity. However, it also comes with challenges, particularly in social interactions and communication, which are important in client-facing roles or collaborative environments. For example, I’ve had to work consciously on refining my interpersonal communication, whether when explaining technical issues to clients or navigating team dynamics. It’s not always intuitive, but understanding these challenges has helped me develop coping strategies and maintain strong working relationships.”\n\n\n\nHe takes inspiration from Christopher Hitchens: “The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks;” and “Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.” Entirely separately, research published in May 2024 (Moral foundations in autistic people and people with systemizing minds) finds a statistically relevant “preference by autistic people for Fairness over Care, and their attraction to libertarian politics”.\n\n\n\nNow relate this last statement to Trezza’s own evolution. His early childhood hacking exploits were distinctly ‘amoral’ or lacking in ‘care’. But there was always an element of fairness (for example in wishing to share his gaming opportunities with childhood friends who had no such opportunities).\n\n\n\nFast forward to the episode with the router and being ‘unfairly’ dismissed. His immediate reaction lacked care – but was later colored by the idea that perhaps he had also been ‘unfair’ to the manager who fired him. It is tempting to think that Trezza’s moral compass has been affected by the growing dominance of ‘fairness’ over ‘lack of care’ as he matured. \n\n\n\nWhether this has anything to do with neurodiversity is unproven – but the process is probably accurate. It even includes libertarian attitudes. Among other employment, Trezza is currently CISO at Atheists for Liberty. “This reflects my dedication to promoting open dialogue and standing up for principles related to freedom, individual rights, and rational thought – values that align with my ethical stance on hacking,” he said. \n\n\n\nAnd now…\nFrank Trezza is fairly typical of most hackers. Early pranks sometimes leading to something more serious – the things he’s not proud of – but ultimately evolving into a strong ethical position on using skills to protect rather than harm security. Apart from being CISO at Atheists for Liberty, he now has his own independent pentesting firm, and also has a day job with a Fortune 500 company where, he says, “I do a little bit of penetration testing, but primarily I’m more focused on securing the external attack surface than I am actually penetrating their systems.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Joe Grand – Mischiefmaker, Troublemaker, Teacher\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Tom Anthony and Scratching an Itch Without Doing Harm\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Chris Evans, Hacker and CISO\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: HD Moore and the Line Between Black and White\n\nThe fundamental characteristic of being a hacker is common to all hackers: it is based on a drive to understand how things work.

However, it also comes with challenges, particularly in social interactions and communication, which are important in client-facing roles or collaborative environments. For example, I’ve had to work consciously on refining my interpersonal communication, whether when explaining technical issues to clients or navigating team dynamics. It’s not always intuitive, but understanding these challenges has helped me develop coping strategies and maintain strong working relationships.”\n\n\n\nHe takes inspiration from Christopher Hitchens: “The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks;” and “Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.” Entirely separately, research published in May 2024 (Moral foundations in autistic people and people with systemizing minds) finds a statistically relevant “preference by autistic people for Fairness over Care, and their attraction to libertarian politics”.\n\n\n\nNow relate this last statement to Trezza’s own evolution. His early childhood hacking exploits were distinctly ‘amoral’ or lacking in ‘care’. But there was always an element of fairness (for example in wishing to share his gaming opportunities with childhood friends who had no such opportunities).\n\n\n\nFast forward to the episode with the router and being ‘unfairly’ dismissed. His immediate reaction lacked care – but was later colored by the idea that perhaps he had also been ‘unfair’ to the manager who fired him. It is tempting to think that Trezza’s moral compass has been affected by the growing dominance of ‘fairness’ over ‘lack of care’ as he matured. \n\n\n\nWhether this has anything to do with neurodiversity is unproven – but the process is probably accurate. It even includes libertarian attitudes. Among other employment, Trezza is currently CISO at Atheists for Liberty. “This reflects my dedication to promoting open dialogue and standing up for principles related to freedom, individual rights, and rational thought – values that align with my ethical stance on hacking,” he said. \n\n\n\nAnd now…\nFrank Trezza is fairly typical of most hackers. Early pranks sometimes leading to something more serious – the things he’s not proud of – but ultimately evolving into a strong ethical position on using skills to protect rather than harm security. Apart from being CISO at Atheists for Liberty, he now has his own independent pentesting firm, and also has a day job with a Fortune 500 company where, he says, “I do a little bit of penetration testing, but primarily I’m more focused on securing the external attack surface than I am actually penetrating their systems.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Joe Grand – Mischiefmaker, Troublemaker, Teacher\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Tom Anthony and Scratching an Itch Without Doing Harm\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Chris Evans, Hacker and CISO\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: HD Moore and the Line Between Black and White\n\nTo complicate this scenario, one hacker can belong to several sub-species simultaneously – like the frustrated ethical hacker whose discovered vulnerabilities are ignored by the vendor and consequently decides to distribute, or even sell, those vulnerabilities on the dark web. \n\n\n\nA further complication is that being a hacker does not require knowledge that you are a hacker (although that usually becomes self-evident as years go by). Frank Trezza, today’s subject, is an example of the latter. He started hacking when he was about nine years old; but he didn’t realize he was a hacker for another five years. All he knew at age nine was that you could do fun additional things with this new stuff called technology. And he learned this from an older brother and their mutual love of the new computer games.\n\n\n\nEarly video gaming was the entrée into hacking for many youngsters thirty years ago. The games were so expensive, not all friends had a copy, and they didn’t necessarily do what you wanted them to do. And as gaming and playing and chatting with multiple friends migrated onto the nascent internet, everything became way too expensive with the additional telephone costs.\n\n\n\nKnowing you’re a hacker\n“Let’s say I wanted to play Wolfenstein with a friend, and he didn’t have a copy,” explained Trezza. “I learned how to take the game that I bought and compress it onto a small disc so that I could share it with him, and he could play it with me.” He was still only around ten years old.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nTechnically, this may have been ‘hacking’, but Trezza wasn’t aware of this. He had an ability that enabled him to share his own opportunities with others, and he did this. This desire to share the benefits he enjoyed with others perhaps less fortunate is a latent and innate influence within his persona.\n\n\n\n“I wouldn’t have considered myself an actual hacker until I was maybe 14 or 15 years old. I had a desire to get on the internet, but not the money to do so. I had to figure out alternative ways of getting online. That was probably the first actual hacking, where I was intentionally bypassing security mechanisms put in place so that I could get access to the internet. At that time, dial-up was very expensive, which led me to learn about phreaking.”\n\n\n\nPhreaking (freaking the phone) is a common factor in the evolution of almost all first generation hackers. Natural hackers with the innate desire to share need to talk to other hackers. Technology provided this opportunity through the early internet and bulletin boards (BBs); but priced it beyond their reach. Hacking the phone system was largely considered an acceptable way of achieving desired ends without (usually) harming anyone other than the big comms companies.\n\n\n\nTrezza described one method he used: “As a kid of 14, I realized AOL had an 800 number you could call, and they charged you a lot of money to use that 800 number – but you didn’t get a separate phone bill for its use. I also realized that when you signed up, they didn’t check the credit card you used until a month later, provided it conformed to the expected algorithm [the Luhn algorithmic verification of the card’s check digit]. So, I could generate a credit card, give it to them and have free use of that 800 number for a month. My parents weren’t going to get a bill, and I wasn’t going to get in trouble for it. Okay, AOL would get stiffed on those hours, but they were a major corporation, and, aged 14, ethically I didn’t see anything wrong with that.”\n\n\n\nWith access to bulletin boards, his access to learning increased. He also began going to local meetups in New York City and the 2600 crew. “I hung out with people like Emmanuel Goldstein and Rob T Firefly,” he continued. Emmanuel Goldstein, a character from the dystopian novel 1984 is / was the handle of Eric Corley; while Rob T Firefly, from the sci-fi Firefly television series, is / was the name used by Rob Vincent. Both are still active with 2600 and the HOPE (Hackers on Planet Earth) conference.\n\n\n\nPranks and law enforcement\nThe process of growing up is invariably one of testing limits (usually personal) and pushing boundaries (usually societal). Young hackers have unusual abilities with unusual consequences; and the evolutionary process for them is equally unusual. It generally starts with technological pranks and evolves into something more complex and sometimes more serious. Frank Trezza was no different.\n\n\n\nOne example of an early prank involved phones. “Me and my friends would change the level of service of somebody’s phone, so that when their parents would pick up the phone to make a phone call from their house, it would say, ‘Please insert 25 cents or 50 cents’ to make this call – because as far as the phone company was concerned, that phone was now a pay phone. Nobody could make any outbound phone calls. It was a prank, but it was a difficult thing to get resolved because the phone company could rarely figure out how that happened.”\n\n\n\nAs skills evolve and young hackers get older, those pranks might also become something less likely to be funny. “Yeah, I did a few stupid things,” he said. “I never ended up in jail, but I did have a few visits from the police. Luckily, they didn’t really have the knowledge or understanding to prosecute that type of crime back then – but I did some stupid things. I have a sealed record as a result, and I’m not too proud of some of the stupid things I did. But really, there are not too many of us that are proud of all the things we did when we were kids. I got in trouble a few times.”\n\n\n\nAs he matured, the common amoral attitude of the youngster began to change. These jokes may have real and unwelcome consequences. He gave an example. It may not have been an epiphanous moment, but it does demonstrate his increasing awareness of the potential harm of hacking for fun.\n\n\n\n“When I was young, I worked for a big retail firm. They hired me and I worked for about three months before I found out they would be laying off me and the others hired at the same time. It seemed that they did this to avoid having to provide health insurance. Then they’d hire another batch of kids for three months. This didn’t sit well with me,” he explained.\n\n\n\n“I understood their elementary computer and payment system; and I had a very low opinion of the manager who was about to fire me. So, I bought a router and set its priority to be the primary router that would provide the IP addresses and DHCP information to all the other devices. I took the label printer and put the manager’s name on it, and then put the router in a network closet. I knew that over time, after I got laid off, it would cause chaos. All the computers on the network would begin to connect to this router to get their information, and they wouldn’t be able to connect to the system they were designed to talk to. When they did work out what was wrong, the manager who unjustly fired me would get the blame.”\n\n\n\nIt was done in a fit of righteous justification. But Trezza soon had regrets. “I’m not very proud of having done that,” he continued. “I think it was a very impulsive thing I did as a kid, and that guy ended up losing his job because of it. I felt like I was justified at the time. I was working with the mindset of a child and seeing things in a very black and white way, missing the nuances involved. That guy could have had a wife and a family, and he might have just been doing what he was told to do from the top, you know, following orders.”\n\n\n\nThis is part of the process of growing up – from seeing things in black and white as a child, to beginning to understand the wider implications of actions. Through this process, Trezza began to focus on using his skills to protect rather than manipulate. It is a process that is common to many hackers.\n\n\n\nNeurodiversity and moral compass\nThere’s an interesting conjecture around this type of moral evolution. He, like most other hackers in this series, is neurodiverse – or more specifically, ADHD and / or Aspergers. The well-known ASD capacity for long periods of hyperfocus coupled with a tendency to ‘think outside the box’ is an obvious boon (but not necessarily a requirement) for hacking. \n\n\n\nTrezza believes his neurodiversity has helped his hacker career while simultaneously introducing some difficulties. “I believe it brings a heightened attention to detail, pattern recognition, and logical thinking – key assets in cybersecurity.

But there was always an element of fairness (for example in wishing to share his gaming opportunities with childhood friends who had no such opportunities).\n\n\n\nFast forward to the episode with the router and being ‘unfairly’ dismissed. His immediate reaction lacked care – but was later colored by the idea that perhaps he had also been ‘unfair’ to the manager who fired him. It is tempting to think that Trezza’s moral compass has been affected by the growing dominance of ‘fairness’ over ‘lack of care’ as he matured. \n\n\n\nWhether this has anything to do with neurodiversity is unproven – but the process is probably accurate. It even includes libertarian attitudes. Among other employment, Trezza is currently CISO at Atheists for Liberty. “This reflects my dedication to promoting open dialogue and standing up for principles related to freedom, individual rights, and rational thought – values that align with my ethical stance on hacking,” he said. \n\n\n\nAnd now…\nFrank Trezza is fairly typical of most hackers. Early pranks sometimes leading to something more serious – the things he’s not proud of – but ultimately evolving into a strong ethical position on using skills to protect rather than harm security. Apart from being CISO at Atheists for Liberty, he now has his own independent pentesting firm, and also has a day job with a Fortune 500 company where, he says, “I do a little bit of penetration testing, but primarily I’m more focused on securing the external attack surface than I am actually penetrating their systems.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Joe Grand – Mischiefmaker, Troublemaker, Teacher\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Tom Anthony and Scratching an Itch Without Doing Harm\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Chris Evans, Hacker and CISO\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: HD Moore and the Line Between Black and White\n\n“Let’s say I wanted to play Wolfenstein with a friend, and he didn’t have a copy,” explained Trezza. “I learned how to take the game that I bought and compress it onto a small disc so that I could share it with him, and he could play it with me.” He was still only around ten years old.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nTechnically, this may have been ‘hacking’, but Trezza wasn’t aware of this. He had an ability that enabled him to share his own opportunities with others, and he did this. This desire to share the benefits he enjoyed with others perhaps less fortunate is a latent and innate influence within his persona.\n\n\n\n“I wouldn’t have considered myself an actual hacker until I was maybe 14 or 15 years old. I had a desire to get on the internet, but not the money to do so. I had to figure out alternative ways of getting online. That was probably the first actual hacking, where I was intentionally bypassing security mechanisms put in place so that I could get access to the internet. At that time, dial-up was very expensive, which led me to learn about phreaking.”\n\n\n\nPhreaking (freaking the phone) is a common factor in the evolution of almost all first generation hackers. Natural hackers with the innate desire to share need to talk to other hackers. Technology provided this opportunity through the early internet and bulletin boards (BBs); but priced it beyond their reach. Hacking the phone system was largely considered an acceptable way of achieving desired ends without (usually) harming anyone other than the big comms companies.\n\n\n\nTrezza described one method he used: “As a kid of 14, I realized AOL had an 800 number you could call, and they charged you a lot of money to use that 800 number – but you didn’t get a separate phone bill for its use. I also realized that when you signed up, they didn’t check the credit card you used until a month later, provided it conformed to the expected algorithm [the Luhn algorithmic verification of the card’s check digit]. So, I could generate a credit card, give it to them and have free use of that 800 number for a month. My parents weren’t going to get a bill, and I wasn’t going to get in trouble for it. Okay, AOL would get stiffed on those hours, but they were a major corporation, and, aged 14, ethically I didn’t see anything wrong with that.”\n\n\n\nWith access to bulletin boards, his access to learning increased. He also began going to local meetups in New York City and the 2600 crew. “I hung out with people like Emmanuel Goldstein and Rob T Firefly,” he continued. Emmanuel Goldstein, a character from the dystopian novel 1984 is / was the handle of Eric Corley; while Rob T Firefly, from the sci-fi Firefly television series, is / was the name used by Rob Vincent. Both are still active with 2600 and the HOPE (Hackers on Planet Earth) conference.\n\n\n\nPranks and law enforcement\nThe process of growing up is invariably one of testing limits (usually personal) and pushing boundaries (usually societal). Young hackers have unusual abilities with unusual consequences; and the evolutionary process for them is equally unusual. It generally starts with technological pranks and evolves into something more complex and sometimes more serious. Frank Trezza was no different.\n\n\n\nOne example of an early prank involved phones. “Me and my friends would change the level of service of somebody’s phone, so that when their parents would pick up the phone to make a phone call from their house, it would say, ‘Please insert 25 cents or 50 cents’ to make this call – because as far as the phone company was concerned, that phone was now a pay phone. Nobody could make any outbound phone calls. It was a prank, but it was a difficult thing to get resolved because the phone company could rarely figure out how that happened.”\n\n\n\nAs skills evolve and young hackers get older, those pranks might also become something less likely to be funny. “Yeah, I did a few stupid things,” he said. “I never ended up in jail, but I did have a few visits from the police. Luckily, they didn’t really have the knowledge or understanding to prosecute that type of crime back then – but I did some stupid things. I have a sealed record as a result, and I’m not too proud of some of the stupid things I did. But really, there are not too many of us that are proud of all the things we did when we were kids. I got in trouble a few times.”\n\n\n\nAs he matured, the common amoral attitude of the youngster began to change. These jokes may have real and unwelcome consequences. He gave an example. It may not have been an epiphanous moment, but it does demonstrate his increasing awareness of the potential harm of hacking for fun.\n\n\n\n“When I was young, I worked for a big retail firm. They hired me and I worked for about three months before I found out they would be laying off me and the others hired at the same time. It seemed that they did this to avoid having to provide health insurance. Then they’d hire another batch of kids for three months. This didn’t sit well with me,” he explained.\n\n\n\n“I understood their elementary computer and payment system; and I had a very low opinion of the manager who was about to fire me. So, I bought a router and set its priority to be the primary router that would provide the IP addresses and DHCP information to all the other devices. I took the label printer and put the manager’s name on it, and then put the router in a network closet. I knew that over time, after I got laid off, it would cause chaos. All the computers on the network would begin to connect to this router to get their information, and they wouldn’t be able to connect to the system they were designed to talk to. When they did work out what was wrong, the manager who unjustly fired me would get the blame.”\n\n\n\nIt was done in a fit of righteous justification. But Trezza soon had regrets. “I’m not very proud of having done that,” he continued. “I think it was a very impulsive thing I did as a kid, and that guy ended up losing his job because of it. I felt like I was justified at the time. I was working with the mindset of a child and seeing things in a very black and white way, missing the nuances involved. That guy could have had a wife and a family, and he might have just been doing what he was told to do from the top, you know, following orders.”\n\n\n\nThis is part of the process of growing up – from seeing things in black and white as a child, to beginning to understand the wider implications of actions. Through this process, Trezza began to focus on using his skills to protect rather than manipulate. It is a process that is common to many hackers.\n\n\n\nNeurodiversity and moral compass\nThere’s an interesting conjecture around this type of moral evolution. He, like most other hackers in this series, is neurodiverse – or more specifically, ADHD and / or Aspergers. The well-known ASD capacity for long periods of hyperfocus coupled with a tendency to ‘think outside the box’ is an obvious boon (but not necessarily a requirement) for hacking. \n\n\n\nTrezza believes his neurodiversity has helped his hacker career while simultaneously introducing some difficulties. “I believe it brings a heightened attention to detail, pattern recognition, and logical thinking – key assets in cybersecurity. However, it also comes with challenges, particularly in social interactions and communication, which are important in client-facing roles or collaborative environments. For example, I’ve had to work consciously on refining my interpersonal communication, whether when explaining technical issues to clients or navigating team dynamics. It’s not always intuitive, but understanding these challenges has helped me develop coping strategies and maintain strong working relationships.”\n\n\n\nHe takes inspiration from Christopher Hitchens: “The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks;” and “Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.” Entirely separately, research published in May 2024 (Moral foundations in autistic people and people with systemizing minds) finds a statistically relevant “preference by autistic people for Fairness over Care, and their attraction to libertarian politics”.\n\n\n\nNow relate this last statement to Trezza’s own evolution.

It was a prank, but it was a difficult thing to get resolved because the phone company could rarely figure out how that happened.”\n\n\n\nAs skills evolve and young hackers get older, those pranks might also become something less likely to be funny. “Yeah, I did a few stupid things,” he said. “I never ended up in jail, but I did have a few visits from the police. Luckily, they didn’t really have the knowledge or understanding to prosecute that type of crime back then – but I did some stupid things. I have a sealed record as a result, and I’m not too proud of some of the stupid things I did. But really, there are not too many of us that are proud of all the things we did when we were kids. I got in trouble a few times.”\n\n\n\nAs he matured, the common amoral attitude of the youngster began to change. These jokes may have real and unwelcome consequences. He gave an example. It may not have been an epiphanous moment, but it does demonstrate his increasing awareness of the potential harm of hacking for fun.\n\n\n\n“When I was young, I worked for a big retail firm. They hired me and I worked for about three months before I found out they would be laying off me and the others hired at the same time. It seemed that they did this to avoid having to provide health insurance. Then they’d hire another batch of kids for three months. This didn’t sit well with me,” he explained.\n\n\n\n“I understood their elementary computer and payment system; and I had a very low opinion of the manager who was about to fire me. So, I bought a router and set its priority to be the primary router that would provide the IP addresses and DHCP information to all the other devices. I took the label printer and put the manager’s name on it, and then put the router in a network closet. I knew that over time, after I got laid off, it would cause chaos. All the computers on the network would begin to connect to this router to get their information, and they wouldn’t be able to connect to the system they were designed to talk to. When they did work out what was wrong, the manager who unjustly fired me would get the blame.”\n\n\n\nIt was done in a fit of righteous justification. But Trezza soon had regrets. “I’m not very proud of having done that,” he continued. “I think it was a very impulsive thing I did as a kid, and that guy ended up losing his job because of it. I felt like I was justified at the time. I was working with the mindset of a child and seeing things in a very black and white way, missing the nuances involved. That guy could have had a wife and a family, and he might have just been doing what he was told to do from the top, you know, following orders.”\n\n\n\nThis is part of the process of growing up – from seeing things in black and white as a child, to beginning to understand the wider implications of actions. Through this process, Trezza began to focus on using his skills to protect rather than manipulate. It is a process that is common to many hackers.\n\n\n\nNeurodiversity and moral compass\nThere’s an interesting conjecture around this type of moral evolution. He, like most other hackers in this series, is neurodiverse – or more specifically, ADHD and / or Aspergers. The well-known ASD capacity for long periods of hyperfocus coupled with a tendency to ‘think outside the box’ is an obvious boon (but not necessarily a requirement) for hacking. \n\n\n\nTrezza believes his neurodiversity has helped his hacker career while simultaneously introducing some difficulties. “I believe it brings a heightened attention to detail, pattern recognition, and logical thinking – key assets in cybersecurity. However, it also comes with challenges, particularly in social interactions and communication, which are important in client-facing roles or collaborative environments. For example, I’ve had to work consciously on refining my interpersonal communication, whether when explaining technical issues to clients or navigating team dynamics. It’s not always intuitive, but understanding these challenges has helped me develop coping strategies and maintain strong working relationships.”\n\n\n\nHe takes inspiration from Christopher Hitchens: “The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks;” and “Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.” Entirely separately, research published in May 2024 (Moral foundations in autistic people and people with systemizing minds) finds a statistically relevant “preference by autistic people for Fairness over Care, and their attraction to libertarian politics”.\n\n\n\nNow relate this last statement to Trezza’s own evolution. His early childhood hacking exploits were distinctly ‘amoral’ or lacking in ‘care’. But there was always an element of fairness (for example in wishing to share his gaming opportunities with childhood friends who had no such opportunities).\n\n\n\nFast forward to the episode with the router and being ‘unfairly’ dismissed. His immediate reaction lacked care – but was later colored by the idea that perhaps he had also been ‘unfair’ to the manager who fired him. It is tempting to think that Trezza’s moral compass has been affected by the growing dominance of ‘fairness’ over ‘lack of care’ as he matured. \n\n\n\nWhether this has anything to do with neurodiversity is unproven – but the process is probably accurate. It even includes libertarian attitudes. Among other employment, Trezza is currently CISO at Atheists for Liberty. “This reflects my dedication to promoting open dialogue and standing up for principles related to freedom, individual rights, and rational thought – values that align with my ethical stance on hacking,” he said. \n\n\n\nAnd now…\nFrank Trezza is fairly typical of most hackers. Early pranks sometimes leading to something more serious – the things he’s not proud of – but ultimately evolving into a strong ethical position on using skills to protect rather than harm security. Apart from being CISO at Atheists for Liberty, he now has his own independent pentesting firm, and also has a day job with a Fortune 500 company where, he says, “I do a little bit of penetration testing, but primarily I’m more focused on securing the external attack surface than I am actually penetrating their systems.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Joe Grand – Mischiefmaker, Troublemaker, Teacher\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Tom Anthony and Scratching an Itch Without Doing Harm\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Chris Evans, Hacker and CISO\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: HD Moore and the Line Between Black and White\n\nTrezza described one method he used: “As a kid of 14, I realized AOL had an 800 number you could call, and they charged you a lot of money to use that 800 number – but you didn’t get a separate phone bill for its use. I also realized that when you signed up, they didn’t check the credit card you used until a month later, provided it conformed to the expected algorithm [the Luhn algorithmic verification of the card’s check digit]. So, I could generate a credit card, give it to them and have free use of that 800 number for a month. My parents weren’t going to get a bill, and I wasn’t going to get in trouble for it. Okay, AOL would get stiffed on those hours, but they were a major corporation, and, aged 14, ethically I didn’t see anything wrong with that.”\n\n\n\nWith access to bulletin boards, his access to learning increased. He also began going to local meetups in New York City and the 2600 crew. “I hung out with people like Emmanuel Goldstein and Rob T Firefly,” he continued. Emmanuel Goldstein, a character from the dystopian novel 1984 is / was the handle of Eric Corley; while Rob T Firefly, from the sci-fi Firefly television series, is / was the name used by Rob Vincent. Both are still active with 2600 and the HOPE (Hackers on Planet Earth) conference.\n\n\n\nPranks and law enforcement\nThe process of growing up is invariably one of testing limits (usually personal) and pushing boundaries (usually societal). Young hackers have unusual abilities with unusual consequences; and the evolutionary process for them is equally unusual. It generally starts with technological pranks and evolves into something more complex and sometimes more serious. Frank Trezza was no different.\n\n\n\nOne example of an early prank involved phones. “Me and my friends would change the level of service of somebody’s phone, so that when their parents would pick up the phone to make a phone call from their house, it would say, ‘Please insert 25 cents or 50 cents’ to make this call – because as far as the phone company was concerned, that phone was now a pay phone.

However, it also comes with challenges, particularly in social interactions and communication, which are important in client-facing roles or collaborative environments. For example, I’ve had to work consciously on refining my interpersonal communication, whether when explaining technical issues to clients or navigating team dynamics. It’s not always intuitive, but understanding these challenges has helped me develop coping strategies and maintain strong working relationships.”\n\n\n\nHe takes inspiration from Christopher Hitchens: “The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks;” and “Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.” Entirely separately, research published in May 2024 (Moral foundations in autistic people and people with systemizing minds) finds a statistically relevant “preference by autistic people for Fairness over Care, and their attraction to libertarian politics”.\n\n\n\nNow relate this last statement to Trezza’s own evolution. His early childhood hacking exploits were distinctly ‘amoral’ or lacking in ‘care’. But there was always an element of fairness (for example in wishing to share his gaming opportunities with childhood friends who had no such opportunities).\n\n\n\nFast forward to the episode with the router and being ‘unfairly’ dismissed. His immediate reaction lacked care – but was later colored by the idea that perhaps he had also been ‘unfair’ to the manager who fired him. It is tempting to think that Trezza’s moral compass has been affected by the growing dominance of ‘fairness’ over ‘lack of care’ as he matured. \n\n\n\nWhether this has anything to do with neurodiversity is unproven – but the process is probably accurate. It even includes libertarian attitudes. Among other employment, Trezza is currently CISO at Atheists for Liberty. “This reflects my dedication to promoting open dialogue and standing up for principles related to freedom, individual rights, and rational thought – values that align with my ethical stance on hacking,” he said. \n\n\n\nAnd now…\nFrank Trezza is fairly typical of most hackers. Early pranks sometimes leading to something more serious – the things he’s not proud of – but ultimately evolving into a strong ethical position on using skills to protect rather than harm security. Apart from being CISO at Atheists for Liberty, he now has his own independent pentesting firm, and also has a day job with a Fortune 500 company where, he says, “I do a little bit of penetration testing, but primarily I’m more focused on securing the external attack surface than I am actually penetrating their systems.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Joe Grand – Mischiefmaker, Troublemaker, Teacher\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Tom Anthony and Scratching an Itch Without Doing Harm\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Chris Evans, Hacker and CISO\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: HD Moore and the Line Between Black and White\n\nAs skills evolve and young hackers get older, those pranks might also become something less likely to be funny. “Yeah, I did a few stupid things,” he said. “I never ended up in jail, but I did have a few visits from the police. Luckily, they didn’t really have the knowledge or understanding to prosecute that type of crime back then – but I did some stupid things. I have a sealed record as a result, and I’m not too proud of some of the stupid things I did. But really, there are not too many of us that are proud of all the things we did when we were kids. I got in trouble a few times.”\n\n\n\nAs he matured, the common amoral attitude of the youngster began to change. These jokes may have real and unwelcome consequences. He gave an example. It may not have been an epiphanous moment, but it does demonstrate his increasing awareness of the potential harm of hacking for fun.\n\n\n\n“When I was young, I worked for a big retail firm. They hired me and I worked for about three months before I found out they would be laying off me and the others hired at the same time. It seemed that they did this to avoid having to provide health insurance. Then they’d hire another batch of kids for three months. This didn’t sit well with me,” he explained.\n\n\n\n“I understood their elementary computer and payment system; and I had a very low opinion of the manager who was about to fire me. So, I bought a router and set its priority to be the primary router that would provide the IP addresses and DHCP information to all the other devices. I took the label printer and put the manager’s name on it, and then put the router in a network closet. I knew that over time, after I got laid off, it would cause chaos. All the computers on the network would begin to connect to this router to get their information, and they wouldn’t be able to connect to the system they were designed to talk to. When they did work out what was wrong, the manager who unjustly fired me would get the blame.”\n\n\n\nIt was done in a fit of righteous justification. But Trezza soon had regrets. “I’m not very proud of having done that,” he continued. “I think it was a very impulsive thing I did as a kid, and that guy ended up losing his job because of it. I felt like I was justified at the time. I was working with the mindset of a child and seeing things in a very black and white way, missing the nuances involved. That guy could have had a wife and a family, and he might have just been doing what he was told to do from the top, you know, following orders.”\n\n\n\nThis is part of the process of growing up – from seeing things in black and white as a child, to beginning to understand the wider implications of actions. Through this process, Trezza began to focus on using his skills to protect rather than manipulate. It is a process that is common to many hackers.\n\n\n\nNeurodiversity and moral compass\nThere’s an interesting conjecture around this type of moral evolution. He, like most other hackers in this series, is neurodiverse – or more specifically, ADHD and / or Aspergers.
