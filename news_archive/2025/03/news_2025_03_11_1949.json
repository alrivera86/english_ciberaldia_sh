        "Content": "The threat actor known as\nBlind Eagle\nhas been linked to a series of ongoing campaigns targeting Colombian institutions and government entities since November 2024.\n\"The monitored campaigns targeted Colombian judicial institutions and other government or private organizations, with high infection rates,\" Check Point\nsaid\nin a new analysis.\n\"More than 1,600 victims were affected during one of these campaigns which took place around December 19, 2024. This infection rate is significant considering Blind Eagle's targeted APT approach.\"\nBlind Eagle, active since at least 2018, is also tracked as AguilaCiega, APT-C-36, and APT-Q-98. It's\nknown\nfor its hyper-specific targeting of entities in South America, specifically Colombia and Ecuador.\nAttack chains orchestrated by the threat actor entail the use of social engineering tactics, often in the form of spear-phishing emails, to gain initial access to target systems and ultimately drop readily available remote access trojans like AsyncRAT, NjRAT, Quasar RAT, and Remcos RAT.\nThe latest set of intrusions are notable for three reasons: The use of a variant of an exploit for a now-patched Microsoft Windows flaw (\nCVE-2024-43451\n), the adoption of a nascent packer-as-a-service (PaaS) called\nHeartCrypt\n, and the distribution of payloads via Bitbucket and GitHub, going beyond Google Drive and Dropbox.\nSpecifically, HeartCrypt is used to protect the malicious executable, a variant of\nPureCrypter\nthat's then responsible for launching the Remcos RAT malware hosted on a now-removed Bitbucket or GitHub repository.\nCVE-2024-43451 refers to an NTLMv2 hash disclosure vulnerability that was fixed by Microsoft in November 2024. Blind Eagle, per Check Point, incorporated a variant of this exploit into its attack arsenal a mere six days after the release of the patch, causing unsuspecting victims to advance the infection when a malicious .URL distributed via a phishing email is manually clicked.\n\"While this variant does not actually expose the NTLMv2 hash, it notifies the threat actors that the file was downloaded by the same unusual user-file interactions,\" the cybersecurity company said.\n\"On devices vulnerable to CVE-2024-43451, a WebDAV request is triggered even before the user manually interacts with the file with the same unusual behavior. Meanwhile, on both patched and unpatched systems, manually clicking the malicious .URL file initiates the download and execution of the next-stage payload.\"\nCheck Point pointed out that the \"rapid response\" serves to highlight the group's technical expertise and its ability to adapt and pursue new attack methods in the face of evolving security defenses.\nServing as a smoking gun for the threat actor's origins is the GitHub repository, which has revealed that the threat actor operates in the UTC-5 timezone, aligning with several South American countries.\nThat's not all. In what appears to be an operational error, an analysis of the repository commit history has uncovered a file containing account-password pairs with 1,634 unique email addresses.\nWhile the HTML file, named \"Ver Datos del Formulario.html,\" was deleted from the repository on February 25, 2025, it has been found to contain details such as usernames, passwords, email, email passwords, and ATM PINs associated with individuals, government agencies, educational institutions, and businesses operating in Colombia.\n\"A key factor in its success is its ability to exploit legitimate file-sharing platforms, including Google Drive, Dropbox, Bitbucket, and GitHub, allowing it to bypass traditional security measures and distribute malware stealthily,\" Check Point said.\n\"Additionally, its use of underground crimeware tools such as Remcos RAT, HeartCrypt, and PureCrypter reinforces its deep ties to the cybercriminal ecosystem, granting access to sophisticated evasion techniques and persistent access methods.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "In cybersecurity, confidence is a double-edged sword. Organizations often operate under a\nfalse sense of security\n, believing that patched vulnerabilities, up-to-date tools, polished dashboards, and glowing risk scores guarantee safety. The reality is a bit of a different story. In the real world, checking the right boxes doesn't equal being secure. As Sun Tzu warned,\n\"Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.\"\nTwo and a half millennia later, the concept still holds: your organization's cybersecurity defenses must be strategically\nvalidated under real-world conditions\nto ensure your business's very survival. Today, more than ever, you need\nAdversarial Exposure Validation (AEV)\n, the essential strategy that's still missing from most security frameworks.\nThe Danger of False Confidence\nConventional wisdom suggests that if you've patched known bugs, deployed a stack of well-regarded security tools, and passed the necessary compliance audits, you're \"secure.\" But being in compliance isn't the same thing as actually being secure. In fact, these assumptions often create blind spots and a dangerous sense of false security. The uncomfortable truth is that\nCVE scores, EPSS probabilities, and compliance checklists only catalog theoretical issues, they don't actually confirm real resilience.\nAttackers don't care if you're proudly compliant; they care where your organization's cracks are, especially those cracks that often go unnoticed in day-to-day operations.\nIn many ways, relying solely on standard controls or a once-a-year test is like standing on a sturdy-seeming pier without knowing if it can withstand that hurricane when it makes landfall. . And you know the storm is coming, you just don't know when, or if your defenses are strong enough.\nAdversarial Exposure Validation puts these assumptions under the microscope.\nNot content to t just list your potential weak points, AEV\nrelentlessly pushes against those weak points\nuntil you see which ones matter, and which ones don't. At Picus, we know that\ntrue security demands validation over faith\n.\nThe Problem with Traditional Exposure Assessments\nWhy aren't traditional measures up to the task of assessing actual cyber exposure? Here are three main reasons.\nVulnerability scores only tell half the story.\nA critical CVSS 9.8 vulnerability might look terrifying on paper, but if it\ncan't actually be exploited\nin your environment, should fixing it really be your top priority? Gartner's recent analysis highlights a startling reality:\n\"In 2023, only 9.7% of all vulnerabilities disclosed were known to be exploited – roughly 8–9% each year for the last decade.\"\nIn contrast, a \"moderate\" severity flaw might be easily chained with another exploit, making it just as dangerous as that 9.8 in practice. The counter-intuitive truth is that not all high-score vulnerabilities translate to real risk, and some lower-score ones can be exceptionally damaging.\nOverwhelmed without clarity.\nSecurity teams continue to drown in a sea of CVEs, risk scores, and hypothetical attack paths. When everything is flagged as critical, how can your people possibly separate the signal from the noise? Again, it's important to remember that not all exposures carry the same weight, and treating every alert equally ends up being as bad as ignoring them altogether. Too often the\nreal\nthreats get lost in the deluge of irrelevant data. However, knowing which weaknesses adversaries\ncan actually exploit\nchanges everything; it lets you focus on–and intelligently triage–the real risks hiding in the dark.\nThe gap between theory and practice.\nTraditional scans and once-a-quarter penetration tests literally provide a snapshot in time. But snapshots age quickly, and poorly, in cybersecurity. A report from last quarter doesn't reflect what's happening\nright now\n. This gap between assessment and reality means organizations often discover their organization isn't actually secure only after a breach.\nAdversarial Exposure Validation: The Ultimate Cybersecurity Stress Test\nAdversarial Exposure Validation (AEV) is the logical evolution for security teams ready to move beyond assumptions and wishful thinking. AEV functions as a continuous\n\"cybersecurity stress test\"\nfor your organization and its defenses.\nGartner's 2024 Hype Cycle for Security Operations\nconsolidated BAS and automated pentesting/red teaming into the single category of Adversarial Exposure Validation​, underscoring that these previously siloed tools are more powerful together. Let's take a closer look:\nBreach and Attack Simulation (BAS)\n:\nYou can think of BAS as an automated, continuous sparring partner that safely emulates known cyber threats and attacker behaviors in your environment. BAS continuously tests how well your controls are detecting and preventing malicious actions, providing ongoing evidence of which attacks get caught and which ones slip through.\nAutomated Penetration Testing\n:\nA methodical probe that doesn't just scan for vulnerabilities but actively attempts exploitation, step-by-step, just as an actual attacker would. These automated pentests (sometimes called continuous or autonomous pentesting) launch targeted attacks to find real weaknesses, chaining exploits and probing your systems' reactions.\nCrucially, AEV isn't just about technology – it's a mindset shift as well.\nLeading CISOs are now advocating for an \"assume breach\" approach:\nby assuming the enemy\nwill\npenetrate your initial defenses, you can then focus on validating your readiness for that eventuality. In practice, this means constantly emulating adversary tactics across your full kill-chain—from initial access, to lateral movement, to data exfiltration—and ensuring your people and tools are detecting, and ideally stopping, each step. This is the goal: truly proactive defense.\nGartner predicts that by 2028,\ncontinuous exposure validation\nwill be accepted as an alternative to traditional pentest requirements in regulatory frameworks​.\nForward-thinking security leaders are already moving this way, why fortify that pier just once a year and hope for the best, when you can continually test and reinforce it to adapt to a rising tide of constantly evolving threats?\nFrom Noise to Precision: Focus on What Matters\nOne of the biggest challenges across industries for security teams is the inability to cut through the noise. This is why\nAdversarial Exposure Validation is so important: it refocuses your teams on what actually matters to your organization by:\nEliminating guesswork by showing you\nwhich\nvulnerabilities can actually be exploited and\nhow\n.\nInstead of sweating over dozens of scary CVSS 9+ vulns that attackers\nmight\nexploit, you'll know which ones they\ncan\nexploit in your environment, and in what sequence. This lets you prioritize defenses based on\nactual risk, not hypothetical severity\n.\nStreamlining remediation.\nRather than an endless backlog of \"critical\" findings that never seems to shrink, AEV gives a clear, structured view of which exposures are truly exploitable in your environment, often\nin dangerous combinations that wouldn't be obvious from isolated scan results\n. This means teams can finally break out of reacting and proactively fix what\nreally\nneeds fixing, dramatically reducing risk, and\nsaving time and effort\n.\nInstilling confidence (the good kind).\nWhen AEV testing fails to breach a particular control – when an attack can't get past your endpoint protection or lateral movement is stopped cold – you gain confidence that that defense is holding the line. You can then focus your attention elsewhere. In short, you and your teams will get credit for doing things right, not blamed for fixing the wrong things.\nThis shift to validation-centric defense has a tangible payoff:\nGartner projects that by 2026, organizations who prioritize investments based on\ncontinuous threat exposure management\n(including AEV) will suffer two-thirds fewer breaches​.\nThat's a massive reduction in risk, achieved by zeroing in on the\nright\nproblems.\nPicus Security: A Leading Force in Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV)\nAt Picus, we've been at the forefront of security validation since 2013, pioneering Breach and Attack Simulation and now integrating it with automated penetration testing to help organizations really understand the effectiveness of their defenses. With the\nPicus Security Validation Platform\n, security teams get the clarity they need to act decisively. No more blind spots, no more assumptions, just real-world testing that ensures your controls are ready for today's\nand\ntomorrow's threats.\nReady to move from cybersecurity illusion to reality?

        "Content": "Inside the most innocent-looking image, a breathtaking landscape, or a funny meme, something dangerous could be hiding, waiting for its moment to strike.\nNo strange file names. No antivirus warnings. Just a harmless picture, secretly concealing a payload that can steal data, execute malware, and take over your system without a trace.\nThis is steganography, a cybercriminal's secret weapon for concealing malicious code inside harmless-looking files. By embedding data within images, attackers evade detection, relying on separate scripts or processes to extract and execute the hidden payload.\nLet's break down how this works, why it's so dangerous, and most importantly, how to stop it before it's too late.\nWhat is Steganography in Cybersecurity?\nSteganography is the practice of concealing data within another file or medium. Unlike encryption, which scrambles data to make it unreadable, steganography disguises malicious code inside harmless-looking images, videos, or audio files, making it nearly invisible to traditional security tools.\nIn cyberattacks, adversaries embed payloads into image files, which are later extracted and executed on the victim's system.\nWhy cybercriminals use steganography:\nEvasion of security tools:\nHidden code inside images bypasses antivirus and firewalls.\nNo suspicious files:\nAttackers don't need obvious executable files.\nLow detection rate:\nTraditional security scans rarely inspect images for malware.\nStealthy payload delivery:\nMalware stays hidden until extracted and executed.\nBypasses email filters:\nMalicious images don't trigger standard phishing detections.\nVersatile attack method\n: Can be used in phishing, malware delivery, and data exfiltration.\nHow XWorm Uses Steganography to Evade Detection\nLet's have a look at a malware campaign analyzed inside the\nANY.RUN Interactive Sandbox\nthat showcases exactly how steganography can be used in a multi-stage malware infection.\nView analysis session with XWorm\nSteganography campaign starting with a phishing PDF\nStep 1: The Attack Starts with a Phishing PDF\nWe see inside ANY.RUN's sandbox session that it all begins with a PDF attachment. The document includes a malicious link that tricks users into downloading a .REG file (Windows Registry file).\nExplore ANY.RUN's advanced features to uncover hidden threats, enhance threat detection, and proactively defend your business against sophisticated attacks.\nTry ANY.RUN now\nAt first glance, this might not seem dangerous. But opening the file modifies the system registry, planting a hidden script that executes automatically when the computer restarts.\n.REG file used to modify registy inside ANY.RUN sandbox\nStep 2: The Registry Script Adds a Hidden Startup Process\nOnce the .REG file is executed, it silently injects a script into the Windows Autorun registry key. This makes sure that the malware launches the next time the system reboots.\nAt this stage, no actual malware has been downloaded yet, just a dormant script waiting for activation. This is what makes the attack so sneaky.\nAutorun value change in the registry detected by ANY.RUN\nStep 3: PowerShell Execution\nAfter a system reboot, the registry script triggers PowerShell, which downloads a VBS file from a remote server.\nInside the ANY.RUN sandbox, this process is visible on the right side of the screen. Clicking on powershell.exe reveals the file name being downloaded.\nPowershell.exe downloading a VBS file inside a secure environment\nAt this stage, there is no obvious malware, just a script fetching what appears to be a harmless file. However, the real threat is concealed within the next step, where steganography is used to hide the payload inside an image.\nStep 4: Steganography Activation\nInstead of downloading an executable file, the VBS script retrieves an image file. But hidden inside that image is a malicious DLL payload.\nImage with malicious DLL payload detected by ANY.RUN\nUsing offset\n000d3d80\ninside ANY.RUN, we can pinpoint where the malicious DLL is embedded in the image file.\nStatic analysis of the malicious image\nUpon static analysis, the image appears legitimate, but when we inspect the HEX tab and scroll down, we find the <<BASE64_START>> flag.\nDirectly after this flag, we see \"TVq,\" the Base64-encoded MZ signature of an executable file. This confirms that steganography was used to conceal the XWorm payload inside the image, allowing it to bypass security detection until extracted and executed.\nStep 5: XWorm is Deployed Inside the System\nThe final step of the attack involves executing the extracted DLL, which injects XWorm into the AddInProcess32 system process.\nXWorm malware detected by ANY.RUN sandbox\nAt this point, the attacker gains remote access to the infected machine, allowing them to:\nSteal sensitive data\nExecute commands remotely\nDeploy additional malware\nUse the infected system as a launching point for further attacks\nUncover Hidden Threats Before They Strike\nSteganography-based attacks are a growing challenge for businesses, as traditional security tools often overlook hidden malware inside images and other media files. This allows cybercriminals to bypass detection, steal data, and infiltrate systems without triggering alarms.\nWith tools like ANY.RUN's interactive sandbox, security teams can visually track every stage of an attack, uncover hidden payloads, and analyze suspicious files in real time:\nSave time with fast threat analysis\n: Get initial results in just 10 seconds and streamline your threat assessment process.\nCollaborate efficiently\n: Share results instantly and work together in real-time sessions to accelerate team tasks.\nSimplify investigations\n: Utilize ANY.RUN's intuitive interface and real-time flagging to reduce workload and enhance productivity.\nGain actionable insights\n: Leverage extracted IOCs and MITRE ATT&CK mapping for effective triage, response, and threat hunting.\nEnhance response\n: Improve data transfer from SOC Tier 1 to SOC Tier 2 with comprehensive reports for more effective escalation.\nProactively monitoring suspicious activity and testing potential threats in a controlled environment is key to strengthening your cybersecurity posture.\nTry ANY.RUN's advanced features\nand gain deeper visibility into threats, and make faster, data-driven decisions to protect your business.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit was\nreleased\nby Horizon3.ai last month. The cybersecurity company described them as \"credential coercion\" bugs that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to compromise the servers.\nIn light of active exploitation, it's essential that Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies apply the necessary patches by March 31, 2025.\nThe development comes as threat intelligence firm GreyNose warned of mass exploitation of\nCVE-2024-4577\n, a critical vulnerability impacting PHP-CGI, with spikes in attack activity targeting Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Spain, and India.\n\"More than 43% of IPs targeting CVE-2024-4577 in the past 30 days are from Germany and China,\" GreyNoise\nsaid\n, adding it \"detected a coordinated spike in exploitation attempts against networks in multiple countries, suggesting additional automated scanning for vulnerable targets\" in February.\nFound this article interesting?

Successful exploitation enables unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code and leads to complete system compromise following successful exploitation.\nA day after PHP maintainers released CVE-2024-4577 patches on June 7, 2024, WatchTowr Labs released proof-of-concept (PoC)\nexploit code\n, and the Shadowserver Foundation reported\nobserving exploitation attempts\n.\nGreyNoise's warning comes after Cisco Talos\nrevealed earlier\nthat an unknown attacker had exploited the same PHP vulnerability to target Japanese organizations since at least early January 2025.\nWhile Talos observed the attackers attempting to steal credentials, it believes their goals extend beyond just credential harvesting, based on post-exploitation activities, which include establishing persistence, elevating privileges to SYSTEM level, deployment of adversarial tools and frameworks, and usage of \"TaoWu\" Cobalt Strike kit plugins.\nNew attacks expand to targets worldwide\nHowever, as GreyNoise reported, the threat actors behind this malicious activity cast a much wider net by targeting vulnerable devices globally, with significant increases observed in the United States, Singapore, Japan, and other countries since January 2025.\nIn January alone, its worldwide network of honeypots known as Global Observation Grid (GOG)\nspotted 1,089 unique IP addresses\nattempting to exploit this PHP security flaw.\n\"While initial reports focused on attacks in Japan, GreyNoise data confirms that exploitation is far more widespread [..] More than 43% of IPs targeting CVE-2024-4577 in the past 30 days are from Germany and China,\" the threat intelligence firm\nsaid\n, warning that at least 79 exploits are available online.\n\"In February, GreyNoise detected a coordinated spike in exploitation attempts against networks in multiple countries, suggesting additional automated scanning for vulnerable targets.\"\nPreviously, CVE-2024-4577 was exploited by unknown attackers who\nbackdoored a university's Windows systems in Taiwan\nwith newly discovered malware dubbed Msupedge.\nThe TellYouThePass ransomware gang also\nstarted exploiting the vulnerability\nto deploy webshells and encrypt victims' systems less than 48 hours after patches were released in June 2024.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nHackers exploit Cityworks RCE bug to breach Microsoft IIS servers\nCritical Ivanti RCE flaw with public exploit now used in attacks\nCISA tags Windows, Cisco vulnerabilities as actively exploited\nCISA flags Craft CMS code injection flaw as exploited in attacks\nIvanti fixes three critical flaws in Connect Secure & Policy Secure"

        "Content": "It’s no secret that cyberattackers have significantly upped their game by using artificial intelligence to write phishing emails that look more legitimate and contain fewer errors. But that’s not all they’re doing with AI.\nGoogle recently revealed that state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups\nare using the company’s Gemini AI assistant\nto get help with coding for developing tools and scripts, perform research on publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, search for explanations of technologies, find details on target organizations, and search for methods to invade compromised networks.\nCyberattackers have the lead in using AI effectively … for now\nOf course, cyberattackers are still using generative AI to write better phishing emails more quickly. That could explain why the\nAcronis Threat Research Unit (TRU)\nfound that the number of email-based attacks\nrose by almost 200%\nfrom the second half of 2023 to the second half of 2024. The most common attack vector? Phishing, which accounts for three out of four attacks.\nCombine those attacks with threats based on deepfakes and even the potential poisoning of AI models, and it’s fair to say that generative AI has thus far been a mixed bag at best from a cybersecurity standpoint.\nWhatever the positive effects of generative AI might be, the downsides of the rapidly evolving technology are also significant. In fact, cybercriminals have an advantage over many cybersecurity providers in the efficient and effective use of AI. But not for long.\nCybersecurity vendors are using AI to strike back\nThe cybersecurity community is rushing to catch up with malware gangs and other threat actors, and the community is succeeding. Solution developers have been using AI for almost a decade for purposes such as detecting unseen variations of malware samples, and more recently, with the advent of generative AI, cybersecurity vendors have found\nnew ways to use AI to battle AI\n.\nOne developing technology is AI-powered chatbots linked to cybersecurity applications such as endpoint detection and response (EDR). These evolving bots can provide concise, easily understandable explanations of security incidents that are free of technical jargon and other barriers to understanding.\nWith a clear picture of what caused an incident and what kind of impact the incident had, users who aren’t IT experts can better understand how to avoid an attempted breach in the future and take steps to make their systems safer.\nAnd there’s more. Vendors are building capabilities into solutions that assist with such critical tasks as threat hunting and remediation. Analysts can use that information to make better informed decisions more rapidly and devise effective strategies to mitigate and remediate security incidents quickly.\nAI can help automate security and management processes by performing a semantic search of past support tickets that feature descriptions that are similar to new tickets. An AI assistant can recommend resolutions based on tickets that have already been resolved.\nAI can also group similar issues automatically and provide root cause analysis. Furthermore, vendors can use it to identify the main reason for time-consuming issues and recommend a fix.\nAI-based script generation could level the cybersecurity playing field\nAnd then there is AI-based script generation, an evolving capability that offers the promise of reducing the need for manual input as well as the need to find skilled engineers. It also has the potential to minimize the chances of human error and accelerate the process of developing scripts.\nOrganizations will be able to use AI-based scripting to manage users and systems, and to automate software installation to perform remediation steps.\nAI can also enable organizations to standardize configuration across thousands of client workloads and automate security configuration. The result is cybersecurity capabilities that require less development time and less expensive expertise to put into action.\nAI-based script generation is particularly useful because it has the potential to deliver powerful capabilities to users of all technical skill levels. As scripting tools evolve, even relative novices will be able to input requirements and receive ready-to-use scripts.\nAI also has the power to enable enhancement of preexisting scripts with additional instructions and in-line comments for script readability. Integration with EDR can facilitate the instant creation of incident remediation scripts in response to security threats.\nThe AI cybersecurity battle will continue\nThe advent of generative AI has introduced new elements of risk to all users of technology. Even AI platforms themselves\nhave come under attack\n.\nBut with rapid innovation, response to user feedback and a keen understanding of how AI can serve as a tool for protection, security vendors will continue seeking to gain the upper hand on cyberattackers who rely on AI for their criminal activities.\nAbout TRU\nThe\nAcronis Threat Research Unit (TRU)\nis a team of cybersecurity experts specializing in threat intelligence, AI and risk management.

        "Content": "Authorities in India today arrested the alleged co-founder of Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2022 for facilitating tens of billions of dollars in money laundering by transnational criminal and cybercriminal organizations. Sources close to the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the Lithuanian national Aleksej Besciokov, 46, was apprehended while vacationing on the coast of India with his family.\nAleksej Bešciokov, “proforg,” “iram”. Image: U.S. Secret Service.\nOn March 7, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment against Besciokov and the other alleged co-founder of Garantex, Aleksandr Mira Serda, 40, a Russian national living in the United Arab Emirates.\nLaunched in 2019, Garantex was first sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control in April 2022 for receiving hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds, including funds used to facilitate hacking, ransomware, terrorism and drug trafficking. Since those penalties were levied, Garantex has processed more than $60 billion, according to the blockchain analysis company Elliptic.\n“Garantex has been used in sanctions evasion by Russian elites, as well as to launder proceeds of crime including ransomware, darknet market trade and thefts attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group,” Elliptic wrote in a blog post. “Garantex has also been implicated in enabling Russian oligarchs to move their wealth out of the country, following the invasion of Ukraine.”\nThe DOJ alleges Besciokov was Garantex’s primary technical administrator and responsible for obtaining and maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Mira Serda is allegedly Garantex’s co-founder and chief commercial officer.\nImage: elliptic.co\nIn conjunction with the release of the indictments, German and Finnish law enforcement seized servers hosting Garantex’s operations. A “most wanted” notice published by the U.S. Secret Service states that U.S. authorities separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex’s servers, including customer and accounting databases. Federal investigators say they also froze over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering activities.\nBesciokov was arrested within the past 24 hours while vacationing with his family in Varkala, a major coastal city in the southwest Indian state of Kerala. An officer with the local police department in Varkala confirmed Besciokov’s arrest, and said the suspect will appear in a Delhi court on March 14 to face charges.\nVarkala Beach in Kerala, India. Image: Shutterstock, Dmitry Rukhlenko.\nThe DOJ’s indictment says Besciokov went by the hacker handle “proforg.” This nickname corresponds to the administrator of a 20-year-old Russian language forum dedicated to nudity and crudity called “udaff.”\nBesciokov and Mira Serda are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Besciokov is also charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Act—which also carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in person—and with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Tuesday 11th of March 2025 12:49 PM \r\n         \nthumpymusk (aka Agent Krasnov) will no doubt pardon any and all criminals that pay him bribes and/or that Putin tells him to pardon.\nNice photo krebs.\nI knew the FBI boys wouldn’t let me down.

In an email or instant message attack scenario, the attacker could send the targeted user a specially crafted file or website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. User interaction is required. Important, CVSS 7.8/10.\nCVE-2025-24993 — Heap-based buffer overflow in Windows NTFS allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally. According to Microsoft, “remote” refers to the location of the attacker. “The attack itself is carried out locally. This means an attacker or victim needs to execute code from the local machine to exploit the vulnerability.” CVSS 7.8.\nCVE-2025-24991 — Out-of-bounds read in Windows NTFS allows an authorized attacker to disclose information locally. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially read small portions of heap memory. An attacker can trick a local user on a vulnerable system into mounting a specially crafted VHD that would then trigger the vulnerability. CVSS 5.5.\nCVE-2025-24985 — Integer overflow or wraparound in Windows Fast FAT Driver allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally. An attacker can trick a local user on a vulnerable system into mounting a specially crafted VHD that would then trigger the vulnerability. CVSS 7.8.\nCVE-2025-24984 — Insertion of sensitive information into log file in Windows NTFS allows an unauthorized attacker to disclose information with a physical attack. An attacker needs physical access to the target computer to plug in a malicious USB drive to potentially read portions of heap memory.  CVSS 4.6.\nCVE-2025-24983 — Use after free in Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges locally. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to win a race condition to gain SYSTEM privileges. CVSS 7.0.\n\nAs is customary, the company did not publicly release IOCs to help defenders hunt for signs of infections.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the exploited bugs, Microsoft called immediate attention to multiple critical-severity bugs that, in some cases, allow remote code execution over the network. \n\n\n\nThese include CVE-2025-26645, documented as a relative path traversal in Remote Desktop Client that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network. “In the case of a Remote Desktop connection, an attacker with control of a Remote Desktop Server could trigger a remote code execution on the RDP client machine when a victim connects to the attacking server with the vulnerable Remote Desktop Client,” Microsoft warned.  \n\n\n\nRedmond also urged Windows sysadmins to prioritize critical, code execution bugs in the Windows Subsystem for Linux, the Windows DNS Server, Windows Remote Desktop Service and Microsoft Office. Advertisement.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nReport from the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) finds weaknesses in current practices.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nA UK government analysis of current best practices for OSS and supply chain risk management finds weaknesses in current standards and makes five recommendations to improve matters.\nThe Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) has published a report (PDF) titled Open source software best practice and supply chain risk management. It finds weaknesses in current practices and makes recommendations on how to improve things.\n\n\n\nThe weaknesses include a lack of industry-specific practices (affecting both sector and company size), no consensus on managing OSS components, no formal process for judging OSS component trustworthiness, and the outsized influence of large tech companies on the OSS ecosphere.\n\n\n\nThe first is both horizontal and vertical. Horizontally, “Outside highly regulated industries, there is a lack of guidance on how to manage OSS components in specific industries, such as education.” Vertically, current best practices do not adequately reflect the limited resources of smaller companies.\n\n\n\nThis leads naturally to the second problem. “Although best practices are broad, we found there was a lack of consensus on the best approach to managing OSS components,” says the report.\n\n\n\nThe third issue is the lack of a formal process for judging trustworthiness. “We found that each developer uses their own trust model and that there is no documented process for evaluating the trustworthiness of OSS components within an organization.”\n\n\n\nThe fourth is a problem that affects all areas of business – the influence and actions of large companies can have a detrimental effect on smaller companies. The OSS ecosphere is no longer solely occupied by small companies and independent coders. Big tech companies are increasingly involved.\n\n\n\n“Due to these companies’ financial backing and resources, they have been able to exert a significant influence on the open-source community.” The result is that OSS influenced by big company impositions does not always reflect the real world use of OSS. It can also sideline smaller OSS contributors and dampen innovation.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nWorking from its analysis, the report then makes four recommendations on how to develop in-house best practices, plus another recommendation on how to make the process actionable. These recommendations are to establish an internal OSS policy; to develop an SBOM; to implement continuous monitoring; to engage with the OSS community; and to use tooling to make it all easier.\n\n\n\nPolicy. “We recommend that all organizations establish an internal OSS policy that details the criteria for evaluating the trustworthiness and maturity of OSS components,” declares the report. It notes that this should not be overly proscriptive, which could stifle innovation and the use of OSS, and it should be sufficiently nuanced to handle the different levels of scrutiny required by different projects.\n\n\n\nIt specifically suggests the policy should include a list of acceptable licenses, an approved open source list, the criteria for evaluating the trustworthiness and maturity of OSS components, the security level of the project to guide the necessary stringency of applying the policy, and an approval process that must be met before an OSS component can be used.\n\n\n\nSBOM. Companies should develop an SBOM for their own software products. ‘This will provide a clear understanding of the software supply chain and help in enforcing an internal OSS policy.”\n\n\n\nContinuous monitoring. “It is important to continuously monitor the software supply chain for vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and new versions of OSS components.” The Equifax breach via a known vulnerability in Apache Struts is an example of not adequately doing so – but also highlights the necessity of monitoring where the OSS is used.\n\n\n\nCommunity engagement.

It finds weaknesses in current practices and makes recommendations on how to improve things.\n\n\n\nThe weaknesses include a lack of industry-specific practices (affecting both sector and company size), no consensus on managing OSS components, no formal process for judging OSS component trustworthiness, and the outsized influence of large tech companies on the OSS ecosphere.\n\n\n\nThe first is both horizontal and vertical. Horizontally, “Outside highly regulated industries, there is a lack of guidance on how to manage OSS components in specific industries, such as education.” Vertically, current best practices do not adequately reflect the limited resources of smaller companies.\n\n\n\nThis leads naturally to the second problem. “Although best practices are broad, we found there was a lack of consensus on the best approach to managing OSS components,” says the report.\n\n\n\nThe third issue is the lack of a formal process for judging trustworthiness. “We found that each developer uses their own trust model and that there is no documented process for evaluating the trustworthiness of OSS components within an organization.”\n\n\n\nThe fourth is a problem that affects all areas of business – the influence and actions of large companies can have a detrimental effect on smaller companies. The OSS ecosphere is no longer solely occupied by small companies and independent coders. Big tech companies are increasingly involved.\n\n\n\n“Due to these companies’ financial backing and resources, they have been able to exert a significant influence on the open-source community.” The result is that OSS influenced by big company impositions does not always reflect the real world use of OSS. It can also sideline smaller OSS contributors and dampen innovation.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nWorking from its analysis, the report then makes four recommendations on how to develop in-house best practices, plus another recommendation on how to make the process actionable. These recommendations are to establish an internal OSS policy; to develop an SBOM; to implement continuous monitoring; to engage with the OSS community; and to use tooling to make it all easier.\n\n\n\nPolicy. “We recommend that all organizations establish an internal OSS policy that details the criteria for evaluating the trustworthiness and maturity of OSS components,” declares the report. It notes that this should not be overly proscriptive, which could stifle innovation and the use of OSS, and it should be sufficiently nuanced to handle the different levels of scrutiny required by different projects.\n\n\n\nIt specifically suggests the policy should include a list of acceptable licenses, an approved open source list, the criteria for evaluating the trustworthiness and maturity of OSS components, the security level of the project to guide the necessary stringency of applying the policy, and an approval process that must be met before an OSS component can be used.\n\n\n\nSBOM. Companies should develop an SBOM for their own software products. ‘This will provide a clear understanding of the software supply chain and help in enforcing an internal OSS policy.”\n\n\n\nContinuous monitoring. “It is important to continuously monitor the software supply chain for vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and new versions of OSS components.” The Equifax breach via a known vulnerability in Apache Struts is an example of not adequately doing so – but also highlights the necessity of monitoring where the OSS is used.\n\n\n\nCommunity engagement.

CVE-2025-1316 is just one of the many flaws in these botnets’ arsenal. \n\n\n\nEdimax camera zero-day\nAkamai pointed out that exploitation of CVE-2025-1316 requires authentication, but threat actors have completed this requirement by relying on the fact that many internet-exposed devices are still protected by known default credentials.\n\n\n\nOnce they have gained access to a device, threat actors run a command execution exploit and execute a shell script that downloads a Mirai payload from a remote server.\n\n\n\nSecurityWeek reached out to Edimax for comment before publishing an article on March 7, but the vendor has only now responded. The company notified us on Tuesday that it has issued a statement on the matter. \n\n\n\nEdimax says it takes product security and user data protection very seriously — despite claims from CISA and Akamai that the vendor has not been responsive to responsible disclosure attempts — but it’s unable to release a patch for CVE-2025-1316.\n\n\n\n“The Edimax IC-7100 is a legacy product that was discontinued over 10 years ago, and its technical support and firmware maintenance were officially terminated,” Edimax explained. “Due to the unavailability of the development environment and source code, we regret to inform that no security patch or firmware update can be provided for this product.”Advertisement.

In addition, users should change default credentials and monitor device access logs for unusual activity.\n\n\n\nDespite being the first to suggest active exploitation of the vulnerability, CISA even now has yet to add CVE-2025-1316 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. \n\n\n\nRelated: Exploitation Long Known for Most of CISA’s Latest KEV Additions\nRelated: Exploited VMware ESXi Flaws Put Many at Risk of Ransomware, Other Attacks\n\nThe cybersecurity agency CISA warned organizations on March 4 about CVE-2025-1316, a critical command execution vulnerability affecting Edimax IC-7100 IP cameras.\n\n\n\nThe agency suggested that the vulnerability may have been exploited as a zero-day, but did not clearly state it in its advisory.\n\n\n\nHowever, Akamai, whose researchers have been credited for reporting the flaw, confirmed to SecurityWeek that the vulnerability has been exploited as a zero-day by multiple Mirai-based botnets.
