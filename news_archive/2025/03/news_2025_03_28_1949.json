        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed 46 new security flaws in products from three solar inverter vendors, Sungrow, Growatt, and SMA, that could be exploited by a bad actor to seize control of devices or execute code remotely, posing severe risks to electrical grids.\nThe vulnerabilities have been collectively codenamed\nSUN:DOWN\nby Forescout Vedere Labs.\n\"The new vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands on devices or the vendor's cloud, take over accounts, gain a foothold in the vendor's infrastructure, or take control of inverter owners' devices,\" the company\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\nSome of the notable flaws identified are listed below -\nAttackers can upload .aspx files that will be executed by the web server of SMA (sunnyportal[.]com), resulting in remote code execution\nUnauthenticated attackers can perform username enumeration via the exposed \"server.growatt.com/userCenter.do\" endpoint\nUnauthenticated attackers can obtain the list of plants belonging to other users as well as arbitrary devices via the \"server-api.growatt.com/newTwoEicAPI.do\" endpoint, resulting in device takeover\nUnauthenticated attackers can obtain the serial number of a smart meter using a valid username via the \"server-api.growatt.com/newPlantAPI.do\" endpoint, resulting in account takeover\nUnauthenticated attackers can obtain information about EV chargers, energy consumption information, and other sensitive data via the \"evcharge.growatt.com/ocpp\" endpoint, as well as remotely configure EV chargers and obtain information related to firmware, resulting in information disclosure and physical damage\nThe\nAndroid application\nassociated with Sungrow uses an insecure AES key to encrypt client data, opening the door to a scenario where an attacker can intercept and decrypt communications between the mobile app and iSolarCloud\nThe\nAndroid application\nassociated with Sungrow explicitly ignores certificate errors and is vulnerable to adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks\nSungrow's WiNet WebUI contains a hard-coded password that can be used to decrypt all firmware updates\nMultiple vulnerabilities in Sungrow when handling MQTT messages that could result in remote code execution or a denial-of-service (DoS) condition\n\"An attacker that gained control of a large fleet of Sungrow, Growatt, and SMA inverters using the newly discovered vulnerabilities could control enough power to cause instability to these power grids and other major ones,\" Forescout said.\nIn a hypothetical attack scenario targeting Growatt inverters, a threat actor could guess the real account usernames through an exposed API, hijack the accounts by resetting their passwords to the default \"123456,\" and perform follow-on exploitation.\nTo make matters worse, the hijacked fleet of inverters could then be controlled as a botnet to amplify the attack and inflict damage on the grid, leading to grid disruption and potential blackouts. All the vendors have since\naddressed\nthe\nidentified issues\nfollowing responsible disclosure.\n\"As attackers can control entire fleets of devices with an impact on energy production, they can alter their settings to send more or less energy to the grid at certain times,\" Forescout said, adding the newly discovered flaws risk exposing the grid to cyber-physical ransomware attacks.\nDaniel dos Santos, Head of Research at Forescout Vedere Labs, said mitigating the risks requires enforcing strict security requirements when procuring solar equipment, conducting regular risk assessments, and ensuring full network visibility into these devices.\nThe disclosure comes as serious security flaws have been discovered in production line monitoring cameras made by Japanese company Inaba Denki Sangyo that could be exploited for remote surveillance and prevent recording production stoppages.\nThe vulnerabilities remain unpatched, but the vendor has\nurged customers\nto restrict internet access and limit ensure that such devices are installed in a secure, restricted area that's accessible only to authorized personnel.\n\"These flaws enable various attacks, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to remotely and secretly access live footage for surveillance, or disrupt the recording of production line stoppages preventing the capture of critical moments,\" Nozomi Networks\nsaid\n.\nIn recent months, the operational technology (OT) security company has also detailed multiple security defects in the\nGE Vernova N60 Network Relay\n,\nZettler 130.8005 industrial gateway\n, and\nWago 750-8216/025-001 programmable logic controller (PLC)\nthat could be weaponized by an attacker to take full control of the devices.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new sophisticated malware called\nCoffeeLoader\nthat's designed to download and execute secondary payloads.\nThe malware, according to Zscaler ThreatLabz, shares behavioral similarities with another known malware loader known as\nSmokeLoader\n.\n\"The purpose of the malware is to download and execute second-stage payloads while evading detection by endpoint-based security products,\" Brett Stone-Gross, senior director of threat intelligence at Zscaler,\nsaid\nin a technical write-up published this week.\n\"The malware uses numerous techniques to bypass security solutions, including a specialized packer that utilizes the GPU, call stack spoofing, sleep obfuscation, and the use of Windows fibers.\"\nCoffeeLoader, which originated around September 2024, leverages a domain generation algorithm (DGA) as a fallback mechanism in case the primary command-and-control (C2) channels become unreachable.\nCentral to the malware is a packer dubbed Armoury that executes code on a system's GPU to complicate analysis in virtual environments. It has been so named due to the fact that it impersonates the legitimate\nArmoury Crate\nutility developed by ASUS.\nThe infection sequence starts with a dropper that, among other things, attempts to execute a DLL payload packed by Armoury (\"ArmouryAIOSDK.dll\" or \"ArmouryA.dll\") with elevated privileges, but not before attempting to bypass User Account Control (UAC) if the dropper does not have the necessary permissions.\nThe dropper is also designed to establish persistence on the host by means of a scheduled task that's configured to run either upon user logon with the highest run level or every 10 minutes. This step is succeeded by the execution of a stager component that, in turn, loads the main module.\n\"The main module implements numerous techniques to evade detection by antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDRs) including\ncall stack spoofing\n,\nsleep obfuscation\n, and leveraging\nWindows Fibers\n,\" Stone-Gross said.\nThese methods are capable of faking a\ncall stack\nto\nobscure the origin\nof a function call and obfuscating the payload while it is in a sleep state, thereby allowing it to sidestep detection by security software.\nThe ultimate objective of CoffeeLoader is to contact a C2 server via HTTPS in order to obtain the next-stage malware. This includes commands to inject and execute\nRhadamanthys\nshellcode.\nZscaler said it identified a number of commonalities between CoffeeLoader and SmokeLoader at the source code level, raising the possibility that it may be the next major iteration of the latter, particularly in the aftermath of a\nlaw enforcement effort\nlast year that took down its infrastructure.\n\"There are also notable similarities between SmokeLoader and CoffeeLoader, with the former distributing the latter, but the exact relationship between the two malware families is not yet clear,\" the company said.\nThe development comes as Seqrite Labs\ndetailed\na phishing email campaign to kickstart a multi-stage infection chain that drops an information-stealing malware called\nSnake Keylogger\n.\nIt also follows\nanother cluster of activity\nthat has targeted users engaging in cryptocurrency trading via Reddit posts advertising cracked versions of TradingView to trick users into installing stealers like Lumma and Atomic on Windows and macOS systems.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Long gone are the days when a simple backup in a data center was enough to keep a business secure. While backups store information, they do not guarantee business continuity during a crisis. With IT disasters far too common and downtime burning through budgets, modern IT environments require solutions that go beyond storage and enable instant recovery to minimize downtime and data loss. This is where business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) comes into play. BCDR goes beyond basic backup to provide comprehensive recovery that keeps businesses running, no matter what comes their way.\nNotably, the shift toward BCDR has become a critical focus area for businesses worldwide.\nThe State of BCDR Report 2025\n, which surveyed over 3,000 IT pros, decision-makers and experts, reveals that more than half of organizations plan to switch their backup solutions within the next year. Apart from the obvious cost concern, businesses cite disaster recovery (DR) execution and the ability to effectively test backup and recovery processes as the key factors driving this change.\nOn that front, Datto BCDR is an all-in-one hybrid cloud BCDR platform that guarantees business continuity and resilience without breaking the bank. Datto BCDR seamlessly integrates local hardware, software and cloud-based recovery to keep businesses up and running. Remarkably, this comprehensive approach allows organizations to consolidate their backup and DR needs under a single, reliable vendor, significantly reducing costs.\nCan a single solution transform the way businesses recover from disasters? Scott Lennon, CEO of Total Communications, thinks so. He calls Datto's backup appliance SIRIS \"a magical IT box\" for its powerful local and cloud virtualization.\nRead the full case study here\n.\nLet's check how Datto BCDR works to facilitate effortless business continuity.\nHow Datto BCDR delivers turnkey business continuity\nDatto BCDR is a comprehensive, turnkey BCDR platform designed to always keep businesses operational. At its core, Datto BCDR combines a robust lineup of backup appliances with both agent-based and agentless backups, ensuring flexibility across different IT environments. Powering the hybrid disaster recovery capabilities of this platform is the purpose-built Datto Cloud, designed specifically for long-term, off-site data retention and disaster recovery.\n1) Seamless deployment across physical, virtual and image-based environments\nDatto appliances are built for quick, scalable and flexible data protection. They offer options for turnkey physical appliances as well as virtual and image-based deployments. Regardless of the deployment type, every solution includes cloud replicas for long-term data retention, off-site redundancy, DR testing and full DR capabilities. Datto SIRIS Private offers a simple way to deploy Datto devices as a private cloud for your customers, which is commonly used in industries like healthcare, financial services and government.\nA key advantage of a Datto appliance is that it doubles as a local recovery target since it can host workloads and applications in the event of a local failover. This ensures fast recovery on-site while maintaining automated, hourly replication to the immutable Datto Cloud for off-site protection.\n2) Flexible backup options with agent-based and agentless protection\nDatto BCDR supports both agent-based and agentless backups, giving businesses the flexibility to protect their systems based on their infrastructure. While agent-based backups are available for Windows and Linux, agentless backups for VMware virtual machines (VMs) eliminate the need to manage and update agents. With these options, businesses can implement a backup strategy that aligns with their IT setup, whether it consists of physical servers, virtual machines or a combination of both.\n3) Customizable backup and replication schedules\nDatto BCDR gives businesses full control over their backup and replication schedules, ensuring that data is always protected without requiring constant manual intervention. Once admins define their local and cloud backup policies, they do not need to configure or manage the cloud environment, making the process simple and efficient.\nFor greater control, backup and replication policies can be fine-tuned, allowing IT teams to adjust backup frequency, retention settings and alert preferences. Additional options like off-site sync throttling and manual backups are available so that backup operations don't interfere with network performance or business operations.\nDatto also offers advanced verification and DR testing features to ensure that backups are healthy and recoverable. Meanwhile, Datto's robust reporting and alerting capabilities enable IT teams to customize notifications, reports and monitoring settings, ensuring full visibility and proactive issue resolution. For those who require an even more granular approach, Datto offers more advanced options that allow IT teams to fine-tune their backup and DR settings to match their unique business requirements.\nGain next-level efficiency with Datto's Inverse Chain Technology™\nDatto's Inverse Chain Technology™ is designed to outperform the popular traditional incremental backups that rely on a chain structure, where a full backup is followed by incremental backups that only capture changes. While this reduces processing power during backups, recovery is slow because the system must rebuild a full backup from multiple incremental copies. Worse, if a single incremental backup is corrupt, all subsequent recovery points become unusable.\nInverse Chain Technology™ solves these problems by storing each backup as a fully independent recovery point, eliminating the need for a rebuild process. Each backup creates a complete server image, including data, applications, operating system and settings, ensuring faster and more reliable restores both locally and in the Datto Cloud. Despite storing full recovery points, storage demands stay low thanks to ZFS copy-on-write technology, which ensures each unique data block is saved only once. IT teams can also delete outdated or unusual recovery points without resetting the backup chain, such as removing backups of a machine confirmed infected with ransomware.\nWith backups as frequent as every five minutes, the technology ensures minimal data loss. It also drastically reduces the management overhead by eliminating frequent full backups and manual pruning.\nExperience the power of the immutable Datto Cloud\nThe Datto Cloud is purpose-built for cloud backup and DR, offering unmatched flexibility, security, performance and cost-efficiency.\nWith Datto Cloud, you get:\nCloud Deletion Defense™\n: Recover agents or backup snapshots, whether accidentally or maliciously deleted.\nGeo-distributed protection\n: Store data in multiple geographic locations for redundancy and compliance.\nEnterprise-grade security\n: AES-256 encryption (at rest and in transit), two-factor authentication (2FA) and immutable storage to prevent unauthorized access and data tampering.\nProven reliability\n: A platform that handles 10,000+ restores per month, supporting over one million end clients.\nTransparent pricing\n: No hidden fees or surprise costs, such as hidden egress fees and unpredictable storage costs.\nBe 100% confident in your backup and recovery\nBackup and DR verification are critical to ensuring 100% recoverability, yet many businesses fail to test their backups frequently enough.\nAccording to the State of BCDR Report 2025\n, testing often takes a back seat due to limited IT staff and time constraints. The report found that only 15% of organizations test backups daily, and 25% conduct tests weekly, suggesting that the remaining operate with an uncertain level of risk. DR testing follows a similar pattern, with just 11% testing daily, 20% weekly and 23% monthly. The rest are extremely vulnerable to prolonged, unexpected outages.\nWith Datto BCDR, backup and DR testing are fully automated, eliminating the manual effort required for routine verification.\nWith Datto's automated backup and DR testing, you get:\nScreenshot verification: Confirm that backups boot and restore successfully.\nApplication verification: Ensure that critical application services like Structured Query Language (SQL), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Active Directory (AD) and Domain Name System (DNS) start correctly after recovery.\nService verification: Confirm that additional system services start upon boot, including:\nSecurity services (Windows Firewall, Windows Defender, etc.)\nNetworking configurations and services\nRemote Desktop settings and access\nRansomware detection: Get backups scanned for suspicious file patterns, alerting IT teams to potential ransomware activity before it spreads.\nLeverage the unparalleled recovery capabilities of Datto BCDR\nA backup is only as good as its ability to restore data quickly and reliably when disaster strikes. Datto BCDR provides all the necessary tools to restore operations seamlessly, ensuring business continuity with minimal disruption.\nSeamless local recovery for instant failover\nGet powerful features for swift local recovery, including:\nLocal virtualization: Datto appliances double as local recovery targets, allowing businesses to host workloads and applications directly on the device. In the event of a hardware failure, software crash or ransomware attack, where recovery to production is not immediately possible, businesses can failover to the Datto appliance and continue operations without disruption.\nExport backup images, including in RAW format: The Export Image function supports export to VMDK, VHD and VHDX formats and offers native RAW export for Linux-based hypervisors, including Proxmox, SCALE Computing Platform and OpenStack. This eliminates the need for manual image conversions, reducing recovery time and complexity.\nAdditional recovery options: Datto BCDR provides granular and full-system recovery capabilities, including file and folder restore, volume restore, virtualization via hypervisor, bare metal restore and ESX upload. These options give IT teams the flexibility to restore data in the way that best suits their needs.\nEffortless cloud recovery with the Datto Recovery Launchpad\nWhat sets Datto apart is its purpose-built disaster recovery cloud, designed for fast, reliable and hassle-free recovery. The Datto Cloud provides self-service cloud recovery tools through the Recovery Launchpad, ensuring IT teams can restore systems quickly when local recovery is not an option. Accessible from the same portal used to manage Datto BCDR appliances, the Recovery Launchpad delivers a seamless, centralized experience.\nIT pros can leverage a comprehensive set of tools here to restore data quickly and efficiently. If they need to recover specific files or folders, they can download them instantly using File Restore. In the event of a major disruption, they can spin up full backups in the Datto Cloud through instant virtualization. For more extensive recovery needs, Image Export allows them to retrieve complete recovery points from cloud backups.\nLightning-fast recovery with Datto's 1-Click Disaster Recovery\nDatto's groundbreaking 1-Click Disaster Recovery (1-Click DR) feature makes disaster recovery fast, effortless and reliable — as simple as reordering from your favorite fast-food app. This feature allows IT pros to clone virtual machines (VM) and network configurations from previously successful DR tests, eliminating the need to manually reconfigure settings during an actual disaster. By reapplying tested configurations, businesses can drastically reduce recovery times and minimize the risk of DR failures, ensuring they meet even the strictest recovery time objectives (RTOs) with ease.\nFinal thoughts\nA strong BCDR strategy is critical for protecting businesses from unexpected disruptions. From securing backups against cyberthreats and validating their integrity to regularly testing recovery processes and executing DR with precision, each step plays a crucial role in ensuring seamless operations. Without the right solution, businesses risk costly downtime, critical data loss and catastrophic financial and reputational setbacks.\nTo avoid such repercussions, businesses can confidently trust Datto, which continues to set the benchmark in business continuity and resilience. With Datto's peerless capabilities, IT pros and businesses can rest assured that their operations remain protected, recoverable and uninterrupted, no matter what challenges arise.\nReady to solidify your business resilience?\nGet custom Datto BCDR pricing now\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "An Android malware family previously observed targeting Indian military personnel has been linked to a new campaign likely aimed at users in Taiwan under the guise of chat apps.\n\"PJobRAT can steal SMS messages, phone contacts, device and app information, documents, and media files from infected Android devices,\" Sophos security researcher Pankaj Kohli\nsaid\nin a Thursday analysis.\nPJobRAT,\nfirst documented\nin 2021, has a track record of being used against Indian military-related targets. Subsequent iterations of the malware have been discovered masquerading as dating and instant messaging apps to deceive prospective victims. It's known to be active since at least late 2019.\nIn November 2021, Meta\nattributed\na Pakistan-aligned threat actor dubbed\nSideCopy\n– believed to be a sub-cluster within Transparent Tribe – to the use of PJobRAT and Mayhem as part of highly-targeted attacks directed against people in Afghanistan, specifically those with ties to government, military, and law enforcement.\n\"This group created fictitious personas — typically young women — as romantic lures to build trust with potential targets and trick them into clicking on phishing links or downloading malicious chat applications,\" Meta said at the time.\nPJobRAT is equipped to harvest device metadata, contact lists, text messages, call logs, location information, and media files on the device or connected external storage. It's also capable of abusing its accessibility services permissions to scrape content on the device's screen.\nTelemetry data gathered by Sophos shows that the latest campaign trained its sights on Taiwanese Android users, using malicious chat apps named SangaalLite and CChat to activate the infection sequence. These are said to have been available for download from multiple WordPress sites, with the earliest artifact dating back to January 2023.\nThe campaign, per the cybersecurity company, ended, or at least paused, around October 2024, meaning it had been operational for nearly two years. That said, the number of infections was relatively small, suggestive of the targeted nature of the activity. The names of the Android package names are listed below -\norg.complexy.hard\ncom.happyho.app\nsa.aangal.lite\nnet.over.simple\nIt's currently not known how victims were deceived into visiting these sites, although, if prior campaigns are any indication, it's likely to have an element of social engineering. Once installed, the apps request intrusive permissions that allow them to collect data and run uninterrupted in the background.\n\"The apps have a basic chat functionality built-in, allowing users to register, login, and chat with other users (so, theoretically, infected users could have messaged each other, if they knew each others' user IDs),\" Kohli said. \"They also check the command-and-control (C2) servers for updates at start-up, allowing the threat actor to install malware updates.\"\nUnlike previous versions of PJobRAT that harbored the ability to steal WhatsApp messages, the latest flavor takes a different approach by incorporating a new feature to run shell commands. This not only allows the attackers to likely siphon WhatsApp chats but also exercise greater control over the infected phones.\nAnother update concerns the command-and-control (C2) mechanism, with the malware now using two different approaches, using HTTP to upload victim data and Firebase Cloud Messaging (\nFCM\n) to send shell commands as well as exfiltrate information.\n\"While this particular campaign may be over, it's a good illustration of the fact that threat actors will often retool and retarget after an initial campaign – making improvements to their malware and adjusting their approach – before striking again,\" Kohli said.\nFound this article interesting?

It's currently not known what the end goal of the campaign is.\n\"We hypothesize the cause of the hijack to be old npm maintainer accounts getting compromised either via credential stuffing (which is where threat actors retry usernames and passwords leaked in previous breaches to compromise accounts on other websites), or an expired domain takeover,\" Sharma said.\n\"Given the concurrent timing of the attacks on multiple projects from distinct maintainers, the first scenario (maintainer accounts takeover) appears to be more likely as opposed to well-orchestrated phishing attacks.\"\nThe findings underscore the need for securing accounts with two-factor authentication (2FA) to prevent takeover attacks. They also highlight the challenges associated with enforcing such security safeguards when open-source projects reach end-of-life or are no longer actively maintained.\n\"The case highlights a pressing need for improved supply chain security measures and greater vigilance in monitoring third-party software registries developers,\" Sharma said. \"Organizations must prioritize security at every stage of the development process to mitigate risks associated with third-party dependencies.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A newly discovered phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) operation that researchers call Morphing Meerkat, has been using the DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol to evade detection.\nThe platform also leverages DNS email exchange (MX) records to identify victims’ email providers and to dynamically serve spoofed login pages for more than 114 brands.\nMorphing Meerkat has been active since at least 2020 and it was discovered by security researchers at\nInfoblox\n. Although the activity has been partially documented, it went mostly under the radar for years.\nLarge-scale phishing operation\nMorphing Meerkat is a PhaaS platform providing a complete toolkit for launching effective, scalable, and evasive phishing attacks that require minimal technical knowledge.\nIt features a centralized SMTP infrastructure to distribute spam emails, with 50% of the traced emails originating from internet services provided by iomart (UK) and HostPapa (US).\nThe operation can impersonate more than 114 email and service providers, including Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, DHL, Maersk, and RakBank, delivering messages with subject lines crafted to prompt urgent action like “Action Required: Account Deactivation.”\nThe emails are delivered multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Russian, and even Chinese, and can spoof sender names and addresses.\nIf the victim clicks on the malicious link in the message, they go through a chain of open redirect exploits on ad tech platforms like Google DoubleClick, frequently involving compromised WordPress sites, fake domains, and free hosting services.\nOnce the victim reaches the final destination, the phishing kit loads and queries the victim’s email domain’s MX record using DoH via Google or Cloudflare.\nBased on the result, the kit loads a fake login page with the victim's email address filled automatically.\nPhishing form overlayed on a fake DHL site\nSource: Infoblox\nOnce the victim enters their credentials, these are exfiltrated to the threat actors via AJAX requests to external servers and PHP scripts hosted on the phishing pages. Real-time forwarding using Telegram bot webhooks is also possible.\nWhen entering the credentials for the first time, an error message reading “Invalid Password.! Please enter email correct password” is served to get the victim to type the password again, thus making sure that the data is correct.\nOnce they do that, they are redirected to the legitimate authentication page to reduce suspicion.\nOverview of the Morphing Meerkat phishing attack\nSource: Infoblox\nDoH and DNS MX\nThe use of DoH and DNS MX makes Morphing Meerkat stand out from similar cybercrime tools as these are advanced techniques that offer significant operational benefits.\nDNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol that performs DNS resolution via encrypted HTTPS requests, instead of traditional plaintext UDP-based DNS queries.\nAn MX (Mail Exchange) record is a type of DNS record that tells the internet which server handles email for a given domain.\nWhen the victim clicks a link in a phishing email, the kit is loaded on their browser and makes a DNS query to Google or Cloudflare to find the MX records of their email domain.\nSending a DNS query to Cloudflare to get the MX record\nSource: Infoblox\nThis evades detection because the query happens client-side and the use of DoH helps bypass DNS monitoring.\nWith the email provider identified from the MX record, the phishing kit can then dynamically serve the matching phishing kit to the victim.\nOne recommended line of defense against this type of threat is tighter \"DNS control so that users cannot communicate with DoH servers or blocking user access to adtech and file sharing infrastructure not critical to the business,\" Infoblox says.\nThe complete indicators of compromise (IoC) associated with Morphing Meerkat activity were made public on this\nGitHub repository\n.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nDarcula PhaaS can now auto-generate phishing kits for any brand\nNew Darcula phishing service targets iPhone users via iMessage\nRussian phishing campaigns exploit Signal's device-linking feature\nNew ClickFix attack deploys Havoc C2 via Microsoft Sharepoint\nMicrosoft discloses unpatched Office flaw that exposes NTLM hashes"

        "Content": "Three security bypasses have been discovered in Ubuntu Linux’s unprivileged user namespace restrictions, which could be enable a local attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in kernel components.\nThe issues allow local unprivileged users to create user namespaces with full administrative capabilities and impact Ubuntu versions 23.10, where unprivileged user namespaces restrictions are enabled, and 24.04 which has them active by default.\nLinux user namespaces allow users to act as root inside an isolated sandbox (namespace) without having the same privileges on the host.\nUbuntu added AppArmor-based restrictions in version 23.10 and enabled them by default in 24.04 to limit the risk of namespace misuse.\nResearchers at cloud security and compliance company Qualys found that these restrictions can be bypassed in three different ways.\n“Qualys TRU uncovered three distinct bypasses of these namespace restrictions, each enabling local attackers to create user namespaces with full administrative capabilities,” the researchers say.\n“These bypasses facilitate exploiting vulnerabilities in kernel components requiring powerful administrative privileges within a confined environment” -\nQualys\nThe researchers note that these bypasses are dangerous when combined with kernel-related vulnerabilities, and they are not enough to obtain complete control of the system.\nQualys provides\ntechnical details for the three bypass methods\n, which are summarized as follows:\nBypass via aa-exec\n: Users can exploit the\naa-exec\ntool, which allows running programs under specific AppArmor profiles. Some of these profiles - like\ntrinity\n,\nchrome\n, or\nflatpak -\nare configured to allow creating user namespaces with full capabilities. By using the\nunshare\ncommand through\naa-exec\nunder one of these permissive profiles, an unprivileged user can bypass the namespace restrictions and increase privileges within a namespace.\nBypass via busybox\n: The busybox shell, installed by default on both Ubuntu Server and Desktop, is associated with an AppArmor profile that also permits unrestricted user namespace creation. An attacker can launch a shell via busybox and use it to execute\nunshare\n, successfully creating a user namespace with full administrative capabilities.\nBypass via LD_PRELOAD\n: This technique leverages the dynamic linker’s LD_PRELOAD environment variable to inject a custom shared library into a trusted process. By injecting a shell into a program like Nautilus - which has a permissive AppArmor profile - an attacker can launch a privileged namespace from within that process, bypassing the intended restrictions.\nQualys notified the Ubuntu security team of their findings on January 15 and agreed to a coordinated release. However, the busybox bypass was discovered independently by vulnerability researcher\nRoddux\n, who published the details on March 21.\nCanonical’s response and mitigations\nCanonical, the organization behind Ubuntu Linux, has acknowledged Qualys’ findings and confirmed to BleepingComputer that they are developing improvements to the AppArmor protections.\nA spokesperson told us that they are not treating these findings as vulnerabilities per se but as limitations of a defense-in-depth mechanism. Hence, protections will be released according to standard release schedules and not as urgent security fixes.\nIn\na bulletin\npublished on the official discussion forum (Ubuntu Discourse), the company shared the following hardening steps that administrators should consider:\nEnable kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_unconfined=1 to block aa-exec abuse. (not enabled by default)\nDisable broad AppArmor profiles for busybox and Nautilus, which allow namespace creation.\nOptionally apply a stricter bwrap AppArmor profile for applications like Nautilus that rely on user namespaces.\nUse aa-status to identify and disable other risky profiles.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nKali Linux 2025.1a released with 1 new tool, annual theme refresh\nRansomware gang encrypted network from a webcam to bypass EDR\nNew Auto-Color Linux backdoor targets North American govts, universities\nCISA orders agencies to patch Linux kernel bug exploited in attacks"

After being acquired by Oracle in 2022, Cerner was merged into Oracle Health, with its systems migrated to Oracle Cloud.\nIn a notice sent to impacted customers and seen by BleepingComputer, Oracle Health said it became aware of a breach of legacy Cerner data migration servers on February 20, 2025.\n\"We are writing to inform you that, on or around February 20, 2025, we became aware of a cybersecurity event involving unauthorized access to some amount of your Cerner data that was on an old legacy server not yet migrated to the Oracle Cloud,\" reads a notification sent to impacted Oracle Health customers.\nOracle says that the threat actor used compromised customer credentials to breach the servers sometime after January 22, 2025, and copied data to a remote server. This stolen data \"may\" have included patient information from electronic health records.\nHowever, multiple sources told BleepingComputer that it was confirmed that patient data was stolen during the attack.\nOracle Health is also telling hospitals that they will not notify patients directly and that it is their responsibility to determine if the stolen data violates HIPAA laws and whether they are required to send notifications.\nHowever, the company says they will help identify impacted individuals and provide templates to help with notifications.\nIt is not known if ransomware was deployed in the attack or if it was purely data theft, with BleepingComputer told that the details of the attack were not shared with customers.\nFurthermore, it is unclear how a customer's credentials could have allowed the theft of data from multiple organizations.\nBleepingComputer first contacted Oracle Health about this incident on March 4th but received no responses to our questions.\nCustomers concerned about response\nWhile the breach and theft of patient data have become a nightmare for the impacted organizations, BleepingComputer was told that Oracle's lack of transparency has also been extremely frustrating.\nIn conversations with numerous sources, BleepingComputer learned that all formal communication was sent on plain paper rather than Oracle letterhead, nor has the company formerly acknowledged the breach as expected.\nThe notification seen by BleepingComputer was not on official letterhead but was signed by Seema Verma, the Executive Vice President & GM of Oracle Health.\nFurthermore, rather than providing written reports, Oracle Health has reportedly directed customers to communicate only with its Chief Information Security Office (CISO) over the phone and not via email.\nThis approach has left hospitals without proper documentation or clear guidance on responding to the security breach.\nWhile Oracle Health has agreed to pay for credit monitoring services and the mailing vendor for patient notification, BleepingComputer was told the company is not willing to send it on behalf of the impacted hospitals.\nThe disclosure of this incident comes soon after reports of an\nalleged breach of Oracle Cloud's federated SSO login servers\n, in which a threat actor claimed to steal the LDAP authentication data for 6 million people. As proof of the attack, the threat actor shared an\narchived copy of a file\nuploaded to one of Oracle's login servers that contained their email address.\nWhile Oracle denied that it had suffered a breach, BleepingComputer was told that samples of the stolen data shared with customers\nwere confirmed to be valid\n.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nOracle customers confirm data stolen in alleged cloud breach is valid\nOracle denies breach after hacker claims theft of 6 million data records\nWestern Alliance Bank notifies 21,899 customers of data breach\nStreamElements discloses third-party data breach after hacker leaks data\nHellCat hackers go on a worldwide Jira hacking spree"

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nAnalysis found that 99% of healthcare organizations are vulnerable to publicly available exploits.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nHealthcare is consistently one of the most attacked critical industries – it is a prime ransomware target. The reasons are clear: it offers a huge attack surface that is poorly secured in a sector that must prioritize continuous operation. It is, in short, easily compromised and most likely to pay.\nThe problem stems from healthcare’s need to ensure medical systems are operational at all times – patients’ lives may depend upon it. This requirement makes patching difficult, and that is exacerbated by the need for FDA validation of any cybersecurity-related changes made to medical devices. It can frequently take more than a year to implement a patch on legacy technology running operating systems that are no longer supported by their vendors.\n\n\n\nClaroty’s Team82 researchers have analyzed and quantified the threat, using data from the firm’s own clients who use its xDome platform. “It includes hundreds of health systems, and thousands of hospitals,” says Claroty’s healthcare industry principal Ty Greenhalgh. “So, we have a data lake of all the devices and their attributes.” \n\n\n\nMore specifically, the firm was able to analyze the security state of more than 2.25 million IoMT devices and more than 647,000 OT devices across 351 healthcare organizations – and found that 99% of the organizations are vulnerable to publicly available exploits (that is, vulnerabilities included in CISA’s KEV list); and 20% of hospital information systems contain KEVs linked to ransomware and are insecurely connected to the internet.\n\n\n\nTriaging this volume of threats is a daunting if not impossible task; but the Team82 researchers propose a specific route. This process combines three main threat indicators: the presence of a KEV vulnerability, a known use of that vulnerability by ransomware actors, and insecure connectivity for the device concerned. (For these purposes, the report describes ‘insecure connectivity’ as “devices that are directly connected to the internet or are accessible using a non-enterprise-grade remote access solution”.)\n\n\n\nTaking a Venn approach to these indicators, the most important vulnerabilities can be located where all three intersect. So, for example, applying this approach to healthcare’s 647,679 OT devices, 11,693 contain KEV vulnerabilities, 3,004 contain KEVs linked to ransomware, and 4,731 have insecure connectivity – but only 1,763 contain all three. The process has highlighted the 1,763 OT devices out of a total of 647,679 OT devices; that is, just 0.3%.\n\n\n\nThese numbers are still daunting, but they apply to 351 organizations. Taking an unscientific approach, we could suggest that each organization is likely to have something like 1,845 OT devices (total divided by the number of organizations). Again unscientifically, if we apply the reduction to 0.3% of the total, this approach would highlight the 5 or 6 OT devices in a single organization that are most in need of special attention – and that is a much less daunting task.\n\n\n\nIf this same methodology is applied to the IoMT devices, the VENN approach reduces the total number of devices deserving extra attention to 22,500, or 1% of the total – which is then further reduced to around 65 per organization.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThese are far from accurate guesstimates, especially down to the per organization figures. KEV vulnerabilities are not guaranteed to include all known exploitable vulnerabilities; but it is the best source available. These are not the only vulnerabilities within devices, but KEVs linked to ransomware usage isolates the most serious threats – and then further linked to insecure connectivity indicates the most vulnerable devices to ransomware attack. It’s an interesting approach to first level triaging in the healthcare sector.\n\n\n\nIt is, however, only one step in a five-step process that Claroty recommends: scoping (critical processes), discovery (identify devices), prioritize (business impact and exploitability), validate (which exposures are real and reachable), and mobilization (actionable mitigations and remediations). The Venn triaging is step 3. Steps 1 and 2 are where you find the data for the triaging process, while steps 4 and 5 are what you should do with the results.\n\n\n\n“Our goal in this report (PDF),” says Claroty, “was to shed light on the riskiest healthcare exposures and provide some context to help identify those assets most in jeopardy, and demonstrate the number of devices burdened not only by known and exploited vulnerabilities, but those that are most at risk to ransomware and extortion attacks, and insecurely connected to the internet.” \n\n\n\nRelated: 560,000 People Impacted Across Four Healthcare Data Breaches\nRelated: 430,000 Impacted by Data Breaches at New York, Pennsylvania Healthcare Organizations\nRelated: Hundreds of Thousands Hit by Data Breaches at Healthcare Firms in Colorado, North Carolina\nRelated: Change Healthcare Data Breach Impact Grows to 190 Million Individuals \n\n\n\nRelated: 2024 US Healthcare Data Breaches: 720 Incidents, 186 Million Compromised User Records\n\nThe problem stems from healthcare’s need to ensure medical systems are operational at all times – patients’ lives may depend upon it.

        "Content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nNoteworthy stories that might have slipped under the radar: Key members of Hellcat ransomware group identified, controversy around CrushFTP flaw CVE, NYU website hacked and defaced.\nBy\nFlipboard\nReddit\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nSecurityWeek’s cybersecurity news roundup provides a concise compilation of noteworthy stories that might have slipped under the radar.\nWe provide a valuable summary of stories that may not warrant an entire article, but are nonetheless important for a comprehensive understanding of the cybersecurity landscape.\n\n\n\nEach week, we curate and present a collection of noteworthy developments, ranging from the latest vulnerability discoveries and emerging attack techniques to significant policy changes and industry reports. \n\n\n\nHere are this week’s stories:\nTruly random numbers generated using quantum computers \nResearchers from JPMorgan, Quantinuum, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory and The University of Texas at Austin have managed to generate truly random numbers using a quantum computer. The researchers said this is the first time certified randomness has been experimentally demonstrated, pointing out that classical computers cannot create true randomness on demand. This is more about what can be achieved with quantum computers rather than generating random numbers. For practical purposes, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) have been around for a while. For instance, Quantum Dice’s QRNG, which is already used by major firms such as AT&T and Thales, is significantly more efficient for practical purposes, without the huge energy requirements of a quantum computer. Randomness is critical in areas such as encryption and the implementation of differentially private machine learning algorithms. \n\n\n\nTroy Hunt falls for phishing attack\nRenowned cybersecurity expert Troy Hunt, the owner and administrator of the Have I Been Pwned breach notification service, admitted falling for a phishing attack that resulted in his Mailchimp mailing list getting stolen. Hunt said the attack did not appear to be targeted, but the phishing email and the phishing page were well designed. The expert quickly realized that he had been phished, but by the time he changed his password the mailing list (containing thousands of entries) had already been exported. Advertisement.

Moucka was arrested in Canada in October. In the US he faces 20 charges. Others believed to have been involved in the Snowflake hack are US Army soldier Cameron Wagenius and US citizen John Binns. \n\n\n\nNYU website hacked\nNYU’s website was hacked and defaced, with the attackers exposing the information of three million students. The website was apparently targeted by hacktivists accusing the university of using race-sensitive admissions. The hackers defaced the NYU website and posted charts apparently showing average admitted SAT scores, ACT scores and GPAs.\n\n\n\nVanHelsing ransomware\nCheckPoint has analyzed an emerging ransomware operation named VanHelsing, which is offering affiliates 80% of the ransom payments. Its file-encrypting malware targets Windows, but the cybercriminals suggest that Linux and other types of systems can also be targeted. At the time of its analysis, CheckPoint was aware of three victims, from one of which the hackers demanded a $500,000 ransom in order to decrypt files and delete stolen data. \n\n\n\nGoogle’s Titan Security Keys available for purchase in more countries\nGoogle announced this week that its Titan Security Keys can now be purchased in more countries. The hardware security key is now available in 22 markets. The latest added to the list are Ireland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Puerto Rico. \n\n\n\nStreamElements data breach\nLive streaming platform StreamElements is notifying users of a data breach. The company said customer data was obtained from a third-party service provider it no longer works with. The incident came to light after a hacker offered to sell StreamElements user data — over 200,000 records — including name, address, phone number, and email address. StreamElements said its own servers have not been breached. \n\n\n\nKey members of Hellcat ransomware group unmasked\nThreat intelligence firm Kela claims to have uncovered the real identities of two key members of the ransomware group named Hellcat, which recently targeted Ascom and Jaguar Land Rover. The cybercriminals are known online as Pryx and Rey. Kela’s investigation showed that Rey (aka Hikki-Chan) is likely an individual whose first name is Saif from Amman, Jordan. Pryx (aka HolyPryx) is believed to be an individual whose first name is Adem. Pryx is believed to reside in the UAE, but originates from a different Arab country. The suspects’ full names and other information has been provided to law enforcement agencies. \n\n\n\nAndroid VRP bonus\nGoogle announced that researchers who submit vulnerability reports to the Android Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) are eligible for a $1,000 bonus if they include an AutoRepro test in their report. These reports include an automated test designed to trigger vulnerable conditions to help validate the presence of a reachable vulnerability. \n\n\n\nCrushFTP vulnerability controversy\nUsers were warned recently about a critical vulnerability in the CrushFTP enterprise file transfer tool. The risk posed by such vulnerabilities is severe, considering that flaws in this type of software have been known to be exploited by cybercriminals. CrushFTP developers said exploitation could lead to unauthenticated access, but the flaw is mitigated if the DMZ feature is enabled. CrushFTP 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+ patch the issue. After seeing that CrushFTP developers were taking a long time to get a CVE assigned to the vulnerability, VulnCheck decided to take charge and got the CVE-2025-2825 assigned to it. However, the security firm was told by CrushFTP’s CEO that the “real CVE is pending” and “your reputation will go down if you do not voluntarily remove your fake item”. \n\n\n\nRelated: In Other News: Critical Chrome Bug, Capital One Hacker Resententencing, Story of Expat Flaw\nRelated: In Other News: Swiss Breach Disclosure Rules, ESP32 Chip Backdoor Disputed, MassJacker\n\nWe provide a valuable summary of stories that may not warrant an entire article, but are nonetheless important for a comprehensive understanding of the cybersecurity landscape.\n\n\n\nEach week, we curate and present a collection of noteworthy developments, ranging from the latest vulnerability discoveries and emerging attack techniques to significant policy changes and industry reports. \n\n\n\nHere are this week’s stories:\nTruly random numbers generated using quantum computers \nResearchers from JPMorgan, Quantinuum, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory and The University of Texas at Austin have managed to generate truly random numbers using a quantum computer. The researchers said this is the first time certified randomness has been experimentally demonstrated, pointing out that classical computers cannot create true randomness on demand. This is more about what can be achieved with quantum computers rather than generating random numbers. For practical purposes, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) have been around for a while. For instance, Quantum Dice’s QRNG, which is already used by major firms such as AT&T and Thales, is significantly more efficient for practical purposes, without the huge energy requirements of a quantum computer. Randomness is critical in areas such as encryption and the implementation of differentially private machine learning algorithms. \n\n\n\nTroy Hunt falls for phishing attack\nRenowned cybersecurity expert Troy Hunt, the owner and administrator of the Have I Been Pwned breach notification service, admitted falling for a phishing attack that resulted in his Mailchimp mailing list getting stolen. Hunt said the attack did not appear to be targeted, but the phishing email and the phishing page were well designed. The expert quickly realized that he had been phished, but by the time he changed his password the mailing list (containing thousands of entries) had already been exported. Advertisement.

Moucka was arrested in Canada in October. In the US he faces 20 charges. Others believed to have been involved in the Snowflake hack are US Army soldier Cameron Wagenius and US citizen John Binns. \n\n\n\nNYU website hacked\nNYU’s website was hacked and defaced, with the attackers exposing the information of three million students. The website was apparently targeted by hacktivists accusing the university of using race-sensitive admissions. The hackers defaced the NYU website and posted charts apparently showing average admitted SAT scores, ACT scores and GPAs.\n\n\n\nVanHelsing ransomware\nCheckPoint has analyzed an emerging ransomware operation named VanHelsing, which is offering affiliates 80% of the ransom payments. Its file-encrypting malware targets Windows, but the cybercriminals suggest that Linux and other types of systems can also be targeted. At the time of its analysis, CheckPoint was aware of three victims, from one of which the hackers demanded a $500,000 ransom in order to decrypt files and delete stolen data. \n\n\n\nGoogle’s Titan Security Keys available for purchase in more countries\nGoogle announced this week that its Titan Security Keys can now be purchased in more countries. The hardware security key is now available in 22 markets. The latest added to the list are Ireland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Puerto Rico. \n\n\n\nStreamElements data breach\nLive streaming platform StreamElements is notifying users of a data breach. The company said customer data was obtained from a third-party service provider it no longer works with. The incident came to light after a hacker offered to sell StreamElements user data — over 200,000 records — including name, address, phone number, and email address. StreamElements said its own servers have not been breached. \n\n\n\nKey members of Hellcat ransomware group unmasked\nThreat intelligence firm Kela claims to have uncovered the real identities of two key members of the ransomware group named Hellcat, which recently targeted Ascom and Jaguar Land Rover. The cybercriminals are known online as Pryx and Rey. Kela’s investigation showed that Rey (aka Hikki-Chan) is likely an individual whose first name is Saif from Amman, Jordan. Pryx (aka HolyPryx) is believed to be an individual whose first name is Adem. Pryx is believed to reside in the UAE, but originates from a different Arab country. The suspects’ full names and other information has been provided to law enforcement agencies. \n\n\n\nAndroid VRP bonus\nGoogle announced that researchers who submit vulnerability reports to the Android Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) are eligible for a $1,000 bonus if they include an AutoRepro test in their report. These reports include an automated test designed to trigger vulnerable conditions to help validate the presence of a reachable vulnerability. \n\n\n\nCrushFTP vulnerability controversy\nUsers were warned recently about a critical vulnerability in the CrushFTP enterprise file transfer tool. The risk posed by such vulnerabilities is severe, considering that flaws in this type of software have been known to be exploited by cybercriminals. CrushFTP developers said exploitation could lead to unauthenticated access, but the flaw is mitigated if the DMZ feature is enabled. CrushFTP 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+ patch the issue.

StreamElements said its own servers have not been breached. \n\n\n\nKey members of Hellcat ransomware group unmasked\nThreat intelligence firm Kela claims to have uncovered the real identities of two key members of the ransomware group named Hellcat, which recently targeted Ascom and Jaguar Land Rover. The cybercriminals are known online as Pryx and Rey. Kela’s investigation showed that Rey (aka Hikki-Chan) is likely an individual whose first name is Saif from Amman, Jordan. Pryx (aka HolyPryx) is believed to be an individual whose first name is Adem. Pryx is believed to reside in the UAE, but originates from a different Arab country. The suspects’ full names and other information has been provided to law enforcement agencies. \n\n\n\nAndroid VRP bonus\nGoogle announced that researchers who submit vulnerability reports to the Android Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) are eligible for a $1,000 bonus if they include an AutoRepro test in their report. These reports include an automated test designed to trigger vulnerable conditions to help validate the presence of a reachable vulnerability. \n\n\n\nCrushFTP vulnerability controversy\nUsers were warned recently about a critical vulnerability in the CrushFTP enterprise file transfer tool. The risk posed by such vulnerabilities is severe, considering that flaws in this type of software have been known to be exploited by cybercriminals. CrushFTP developers said exploitation could lead to unauthenticated access, but the flaw is mitigated if the DMZ feature is enabled. CrushFTP 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+ patch the issue. After seeing that CrushFTP developers were taking a long time to get a CVE assigned to the vulnerability, VulnCheck decided to take charge and got the CVE-2025-2825 assigned to it. However, the security firm was told by CrushFTP’s CEO that the “real CVE is pending” and “your reputation will go down if you do not voluntarily remove your fake item”. \n\n\n\nRelated: In Other News: Critical Chrome Bug, Capital One Hacker Resententencing, Story of Expat Flaw\nRelated: In Other News: Swiss Breach Disclosure Rules, ESP32 Chip Backdoor Disputed, MassJacker\n\nKey members of Hellcat ransomware group unmasked\nThreat intelligence firm Kela claims to have uncovered the real identities of two key members of the ransomware group named Hellcat, which recently targeted Ascom and Jaguar Land Rover.

Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThrough linting, insecure practices such as the use of weak or obsolete cryptographic algorithms can be discovered, interoperability is improved, and the risk of non-compliance is reduced, the internet giant says.\n\n\n\nBoth open source and custom linting projects exist, including ‘meta’ linters, which combine multiple projects for increased simplicity and performance.\n\n\n\nIn line with the public roadmap named ‘Moving Forward, Together’, starting July 15, 2025, the Chrome Root Program will prohibit demonstrated weak domain control validation methods, further improving the Web PKI ecosystem.\n\n\n\n“It’s essential we all work together to continually improve the Web PKI, and reduce the opportunities for risk and abuse before measurable harm can be realized.

The exploit chain also targeted another vulnerability (which Kaspersky was unable to identify) to achieve remote code execution. \n\n\n\nThe campaign, which the security firm dubbed Operation ForumTroll because it used fake invitations to a scientific forum as a lure, targeted media outlets, educational institutions and government organizations in Russia.\n\n\n\nFirefox developers have analyzed CVE-2025-2783 and found that a similar pattern also exists in their IPC code.\n\n\n\nThe issue, described as an incorrect handle, can allow a compromised child process to cause the parent process to “return an unintentionally powerful handle, leading to a sandbox escape”, Firefox developers said.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Firefox, the vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-2857. The flaw only impacts Firefox for Windows and it has been patched with the release of versions 136.0.4, 128.8.1 (ESR), and 115.21.1 (ESR).\n\n\n\nMozilla noted that the original vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, but did not mention anything about attacks aimed at Firefox users. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nThe Tor browser, which is based on Firefox, has also been updated to address the vulnerability. \n\n\n\nThe cybersecurity agency CISA on Thursday added the Chrome flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The agency noted that other Chromium-based browsers may also be affected, including Microsoft Edge and Opera. Microsoft does not appear to have issued an advisory. \n\n\n\nThe exploitation of Firefox vulnerabilities is not as common as the exploitation of Chrome bugs, but there have been roughly a dozen security holes exploited over the past decade. One example came to light in late November 2024, when ESET reported that a Russian APT had chained Firefox and Windows zero-days to deploy a backdoor.\n\n\n\nRelated: Chrome 134, Firefox 136 Patch High-Severity Vulnerabilities\nRelated: Chrome 133, Firefox 135 Updates Patch High-Severity Vulnerabilities\nRelated: Chrome 133, Firefox 135 Patch High-Severity Vulnerabilities\n\nOn Tuesday, Google announced a Chrome update that patches CVE-2025-2783, a vulnerability reported to the tech giant by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, whose researchers saw it being exploited in attacks aimed at Russian organizations.\n\n\n\nKaspersky said CVE-2025-2783 has been exploited since at least mid-March by what is likely a state-sponsored threat actor to escape Chrome’s sandbox.
