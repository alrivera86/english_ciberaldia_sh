The U.S. Embassy said every visa application review is a \"national security decision.\"\n\"Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their personal social media accounts to 'public' to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States,\" the embassy\nsaid\nin a post on X.\nUnder the new rules, Indian students and others planning to pursue academia or enroll in vocational or exchange programs are mandated to ensure that their social media profiles are set to public before submitting their visa applications. A refusal to set the accounts to \"public\" could be grounds for rejection.\nThe embassy noted that the United States has required visa applicants to provide social media identifiers on immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application forms since 2019.\nIt also said every piece of \"available\" information is used as part of its visa screening and vetting to identify visa applicants who are deemed inadmissible to the country, including those who pose a threat to its national security. However, it did not spell out what these steps would look for.\nSimilar directives have been issued by other U.S. embassies across the world, with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico\nstating\nthat visa applicants must list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years.\nThe development comes weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration\nordered\nembassies around the world to stop scheduling appointments for student visas to expand social media vetting of such applicants. Last week, the U.S. Department of State said it's resuming the process, but with new measures that require applicants to unlock their social media accounts for government review.\n\"The United States must be vigilant during the visa issuance process to ensure that those applying for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans and our national interests, and that all applicants credibly establish their eligibility for the visa sought, including that they intend to engage in activities consistent with the terms for their admission,\" the department\nsaid\n.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have detailed two novel methods that can be used to disrupt\ncryptocurrency mining\nbotnets.\nThe methods take advantage of the design of various common\nmining topologies\nin order to shut down the\nmining process\n, Akamai said in a new report published today.\n\"We developed two techniques by leveraging the mining topologies and pool policies that enable us to reduce a cryptominer botnet's effectiveness to the point of completely shutting it down, which forces the attacker to make radical changes to their infrastructure or even abandon the entire campaign,\" security researcher Maor Dahan\nsaid\n.\nThe techniques, the web infrastructure company said, hinge on exploiting the\nStratum\nmining protocol such that it causes an attacker's mining proxy or wallet to be banned, effectively disrupting the operation.\nThe first of the two approaches, dubbed bad shares, entails banning the mining proxy from the network, which, in turn, results in the shutdown of the entire operation and causes the victim's CPU usage to plummet from 100% to 0%.\nWhile a mining proxy acts as an intermediary and shields an attacker's mining pool and, by extension, their wallet addresses, it also becomes a single point of failure by interfering with its regular function.\n\"The idea is simple: By connecting to a malicious proxy as a miner, we can submit invalid mining job results — bad shares — that will bypass the proxy validation and will be submitted to the pool,\" Dahan explained. \"Consecutive bad shares will eventually get the proxy banned, effectively halting mining operations for the entire cryptomining botnet.\"\nThis, in turn, entails using an in-house developed tool called\nXMRogue\nto impersonate a miner, connect to a mining proxy, submit consecutive bad shares, and ultimately ban the mining proxy from the pool.\nThe second method devised by Akamai exploits scenarios where a victim miner is connected directly to a public pool sans a proxy, leveraging the fact that the pool can ban a wallet's address for one hour if it has more than 1,000 workers.\nIn other words, initiating more than 1,000 login requests using the attacker's wallet concurrently will force the pool to ban the attacker's wallet. However, it's worth noting this isn't a permanent solution as the account can stage a recovery as soon as the multiple login connections are stopped.\nAkamai noted that while the aforementioned methods have been used to target Monero cryptocurrency miners, they can be extended to other cryptocurrencies as well.\n\"The techniques presented above show how defenders can effectively shut down malicious cryptominer campaigns without disrupting the legitimate pool operation by taking advantage of pool policies,\" Dahan said.\n\"A legitimate miner will be able to quickly recover from this type of attack, as they can easily modify their IP or wallet locally. This task would be much more difficult for a malicious cryptominer as it would require modifying the entire botnet. For less sophisticated miners, however, this defense could completely disable the botnet.\"\nFound this article interesting?

Select variants with the local keylogging capability have been found to also collect user cookies, User-Agent strings, and the timestamp.\nOne advantage of this approach is that the chances of detection are next to nothing as there is no outbound traffic to transmit the information.\nThe second variant detected by Positive Technologies, on the other hand, uses a Telegram bot as an exfiltration point via XHR GET requests with the encoded login and password stored in the APIKey and AuthToken headers, respectively.\nA second method involves using a Domain Name System (DNS)\ntunnel\nin conjunction with an HTTPS POST request to send the user credentials and sneak past an organization's defenses.\nTwenty-two of the compromised servers have been found in government organizations, followed by infections in the IT, industrial, and logistics companies. Vietnam, Russia, Taiwan, China, Pakistan, Lebanon, Australia, Zambia, the Netherlands, and Turkey are among the top 10 targets.\n\"A large number of Microsoft Exchange servers accessible from the Internet remain vulnerable to older vulnerabilities,\" the researchers said. \"By embedding malicious code into legitimate authentication pages, attackers are able to stay undetected for long periods while capturing user credentials in plaintext.\"\nFound this article interesting?

And I couldn't have asked for a better kickoff panel: three cybersecurity leaders who don't just talk security, they live it.\nLet me introduce them.\nAlex Delay\n, CISO at IDB Bank, knows what it means to defend a highly regulated environment.\nBen Mead\n, Director of Cybersecurity at Avidity Biosciences, brings a forward-thinking security perspective that reflects the innovation behind Avidity's targeted RNA therapeutics. Last but not least,\nMichael Francess\n, Director of Cybersecurity Advanced Threat at Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, leads the charge in protecting the franchise. Each brought a unique vantage point to a common challenge: applying Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) to complex production environments.\nGartner made waves in 2023 with a bold prediction: organizations that prioritize CTEM will be\nthree times less likely\nto be breached by 2026. But here's the kicker - only if it's operationalized.\nSpeaking with these seasoned defenders, we unpacked the realities and challenges behind the hype of implementing and operationalizing an effective Exposure Management strategy, addressing the following tough questions:\nWhat does a good CTEM program look like and what are the typical challenges that need to be overcome?\nHow do you optimize cyber and risk reporting to influence board-level decisions?\nAnd ultimately, how do you measure the success of your CTEM program?\nChallenges, Priorities, and Best Practices\nCTEM isn't plug-and-play. The panelists' prescription was clear: start with asset inventory and identity management; weak service accounts, over-permissioned users, legacy logins. None of these are small gaps, they're wide-open doors that need to be checked frequently. And for all of our panelists, frequency matters - a lot. Because guess what? Adversaries are constantly challenging defenses too. For internal assets, weekly validation is the rule of thumb. For external-facing assets? Daily. As they see it, it's the only way to maintain a constant handle over their constantly changing environments.\nSurprisingly, Michael pointed to threat intelligence as the backbone of any security testing program. \"You need to understand your adversaries, simulate their TTPs, and test your defenses against real-world scenarios, not just patching CVEs.\" That's the key difference between CTEM and vulnerability management. Vulnerability management is about patching. Exposure management is about figuring out whether your controls actually work to block threats.\nReporting: Translating Cyber to Risk Terms\nIn the banking industry, like many other highly regulated industries, Alex couldn't emphasize enough the need to be prepared to answer hard questions asked from regulators. \"You\nwill\nget challenged on your exposure, your remediation timelines, and your risk treatment. And that's a good thing. It forces clarity and accountability\".\nBut even outside regulated industries, the conversation is changing. Boards do not want to hear about CVSS scores. They want to understand\nrisk -\nand that's a completely different discussion. Is the company's risk profile going up or down? Where is it concentrated? And what are we doing about it?\nMeasuring Progress\nSuccess in CTEM isn't about counting vulnerabilities; Ben pinned it down when he said he measures the number of exploited attack paths his team has closed. He shared how validating attack paths revealed risky security gaps, like over-permissioned accounts and forgotten assets. Suddenly, risk becomes visible.\nOthers took it in another direction with tabletop exercises that walk leadership through real\nattack scenarios. It's not about metrics, it's about explaining the risk and the consequences. A shift that moves the discussion from noise to signal, and gives the business clarity on what matters:\nwhere we're exposed, and what we're doing about it\n.\nFrom Concept to Action\nWant to hear how these defenders are putting CTEM into action without drowning in noise?\nThis episode dives deep into the real questions: where do you start, how do you stay focused on what's exploitable, and how do you connect it all to business risk? You'll hear first-hand how security leaders like Alex, Ben, and Michael are tackling these challenges head-on, with a few surprises along the way…\n🎧Make sure to catch the full conversation on\nApple Podcast\nand\nSpotify\nFound this article interesting?

The attacks, per the cybersecurity company, commence with a request from the IP address 198.199.72[.]27 to obtain a\nlist of all containers\non the machine.\nIf no containers are present, the attacker proceeds to create a new one based on the \"alpine\" Docker image and mounts the \"/hostroot\" directory – i.e., the root directory (\"/\") of the physical or virtual host machine – as a volume inside it. This behavior poses security risks as it allows the container to access and modify files and directories on the host system, resulting in a container escape.\nThe threat actors then execute a carefully orchestrated sequence of actions that involves running a Base64-encoded shell script to set up Tor on the container as part of the creation request and ultimately fetch and execute a remote script from a .onion domain (\"wtxqf54djhp5pskv2lfyduub5ievxbyvlzjgjopk6hxge5umombr63ad[.]onion\")\n\"It reflects a common tactic used by attackers to hide command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure, avoid detection, and deliver malware or miners within compromised cloud or container environments,\" the researchers said. \"Additionally, the attacker uses 'socks5h' to route all traffic and DNS resolution through Tor for enhanced anonymity and evasion.\"\nOnce the container is created, the \"docker-init.sh\" shell script is deployed, which then checks for the \"/hostroot\" directory mounted earlier and modifies the system's SSH configuration to set up remote access by enabling root login and adding an attacker-controlled SSH key into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.\nThe threat actor has also been found to install various tools like\nmasscan\n,\nlibpcap\n,\nzstd\n, and\ntorsocks\n, beacon to the C&C server details about the infected system, and ultimately deliver a binary that acts as a dropper for the XMRig cryptocurrency miner, along with the necessary mining configuration, the wallet addresses, and mining pool URLs.\n\"This approach helps attackers avoid detection and simplifies deployment in compromised environments,\" Trend Micro said, adding it observed the activity targeting technology companies, financial services, and healthcare organizations.\nThe findings point to an\nongoing\ntrend\nof\ncyber\nattacks\nthat\ntarget\nmisconfigured or poorly secured\ncloud environments for cryptojacking purposes.\nThe development comes as Wiz revealed that a scan of public code repositories has uncovered hundreds of validated secrets in mcp.json, .env, and AI agent configuration files and Python notebooks (.ipynb), turning them into a treasure trove for attackers.\nThe cloud security firm said it found valid secrets belonging to over 30 companies and startups, including those belonging to Fortune 100 companies.\n\"Beyond just secrets, code execution results in Python notebooks should be generally treated as sensitive,\" researchers Shay Berkovich and Rami McCarthy\nsaid\n. \"Their content, if correlated to a developer's organization, can provide reconnaissance details for malicious actors.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The primary task of the DLL is to load shellcode from the PNG file, resulting in the execution of the memory-resident COVENANT framework.\nCOVENANT subsequently downloads two more intermediate payloads that are designed to launch the BEARDSHELL backdoor on the compromised host.\nTo mitigate potential risks associated with the threat, state organizations are recommended to keep an eye on network traffic associated with the domains \"app.koofr[.]net\" and \"api.icedrive[.]net.\"\nThe disclosure comes as CERT-UA\nrevealed\nAPT28's targeting of outdated Roundcube webmail instances in Ukraine to deliver exploits for CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2021-44026, and CVE-2020-12641 via phishing emails that ostensibly contain text about news events but weaponize these flaws to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\nThe email \"contained a content bait in the form of an article from the publication 'NV' (nv.ua), as well as an exploit for the Roundcube XSS vulnerability CVE-2020-35730 and the corresponding JavaScript code designed to download and run additional JavaScript files: 'q.js' and 'e.js,'\" CERT-UA said.\n\"E.js\" ensures the creation of a mailbox rule for redirecting incoming emails to a third-party email address, in addition to exfiltrating the victim's address book and session cookies via HTTP POST requests. On the other hand, \"q.js\" features an exploit for an SQL injection flaw in Roundcube (CVE-2021-44026) that's used to gather information from the Roundcube database.\nCERT-UA said it also discovered a third JavaScript file named \"c.js\" that includes an exploit for a third Roundcube flaw (CVE-2020-12641) to execute arbitrary commands on the mail server. In all, similar phishing emails were sent to the email addresses of more than 40 Ukrainian organizations.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A cybersecurity researcher has developed FileFix, a variant of the ClickFix social engineering attack that tricks users into executing malicious commands via the File Explorer address bar in Windows.\nFileFix, a variation of the social-engineering attack called ClickFix, allows threat actors to execute commands on the victim system through the File Explorer address bar in Windows.\nCybersecurity researcher\nmr.d0x\ndiscovered the new method and demonstrated that it could be used in attacks targeting company employees using simple social engineering techniques.\nClickFix\nattacks are browser-based and rely on tricking users into clicking on a button on a website that copies a command to Windows clipboard. Users are then instructed to paste the command into PowerShell or another command prompt to fix an issue.\nThese types of attacks commonly masquerade as captchas or errors that prevent the user from using a site without first \"fixing\" the issue.\nExample of a fake CAPTCHA in a ClickFix attack\nSource: SilentPush\nThe FileFix divergence\nIn a ClickFix attack, when users click a website button, a malicious PowerShell command is automatically copied into the Windows clipboard followed by instructions to paste it into the command prompt through the Run Dialog (Win+R).\nmr.d0x found a way to achieve the same goal but by having the target paste the command in the more familiar user interface of Windows File Explorer.\nSince File Explorer can execute operating system commands, the researcher combined the functionality with the browser’s file upload feature and came up with a highly plausible scenario.\nFileFix attacks also rely on a phishing page, but the ruse is no longer presented as an error or issue. Instead, it may appear as a notification indicating that a file has been shared with the user and includes a request to paste the path into File Explorer to locate it.\n“The phishing page includes an “Open File Explorer” button that, when clicked, launches File Explorer through the file upload functionality and copies the PowerShell command to the clipboard” -\nmr.d0x\nHowever, to keep the deceit intact, an attacker can hide the malicious PowerShell command by concantenating a dummy file path within a PowerShell comment.\nThis causes only the fake path to be initially seen in the File Explorer address bar, hiding the malicious PowerShell command that precedes it.\nA video demonstrating the new ClickFix variation shows that by placing the dummy file path as a comment after the PowerShell command, the malicious string is no longer visible to the user, and File Explorer executes it.\nSince the attack requires a file upload button, the researcher carefully considered the FileFix method so that it avoids users accidentally selecting a file from the computer.\nIn the proof-of-concept code for the phishing page, mr.d0x added a few lines that block file upload action “by intercepting the file selection event and immediately clearing the input.”\nIf this happens, an attacker could display an alert informing users that they failed to follow the instructions and try again.\nClickFix campaigns\nClickFix attacks have proven to be a method so efficient to deploy malware on user systems that it has been used in\nransomware attacks\nand even\nstate-sponsored groups used it\n.\nNorth Korean\nstate hacker group ‘Kimsuky’\nincluded ClickFix elements in one of their campaigns where they used a PDF file to direct targets to a fake device registration link showing instructions to run PowerShell as administrator and paste code provided by the attacker.\nIn a ClickFix campaign observed by Microsoft, cybercriminals\nimpersonated Booking.com\nto deliver infostealers and remote access trojans to hospitality workers.\nThe attack method has also been\nadapted to Linux\n, where a shell command is automatically copied to the clipboard after visiting a malicious website. The potential victim is then guided to open a Run dialog and execute the command.\nFileFix, although a variation, shows that such phishing attacks can be improved by switching command execution to an environment that is friendlier and more familiar to users.\nmr.d0x told BleepingComputer that he believes his FileFix attack will soon be adopted by threat actors due to its simplicity and use of a well-known Windows utility.\nIn the past, cybercriminals quickly started using the researcher's\nbrowser-in-the-browser phishing technique\n, showing that bad actors are constantly interested in learning about new attack methods.\nWhy IT teams are ditching manual patch management\nPatching used to mean complex scripts, long hours, and endless fire drills.

        "Date": "2025-06-24",
        "Content": "As threat actors grow faster, stealthier, and more persistent, the approach to pentesting needs to keep evolving. Traditional, periodic assessments no longer keep up with rapidly changing attack surfaces. Static tests offer a snapshot, but attackers see a live stream. Security testing needs to shift testing models to mirror how real-world attackers operate.\nAt Sprocket Security, our\nContinuous Penetration Testing\n(CPT) solution is an always on, always active, and hybrid pentesting model.\nIn this article, we will compare the most common models — Point-in-Time Pentests, PTaaS, Bug Bounty Programs, Automated Tools, and Continuous Penetration Testing — to explore why CPT is emerging as the most effective model for proactive security teams.\nThe Current Landscape of Penetration Testing Options\nPentesting isn’t one size fits all. Thus, multiple models have emerged, each attempting to balance depth, speed, and coverage. But not all pentests are created equal.\nUnderstanding how these approaches differ is critical to choosing the right offensive security strategy for your organization.\nBelow, we break down the five most common models by strengths, limitations, and where they fit in a proactive security program.\n1. Point-in-Time Pentest\nWhat it is: Scheduled manual tests, often annual or quarterly, focused on predefined scopes.\nStrengths: Thorough, compliance-friendly, human-driven.\nLimitations: Infrequent, static, limited to the moment in time it was conducted.\nCost: One-time cost, but with no ongoing coverage and additional fees for retesting.\nAlso called\nlegacy tests\n, they often find real issues, but these quickly go stale as infrastructure, applications, and threats evolve.\n2. PTaaS (Penetration Testing as a Service)\nWhat it is: Platform-based testing with dashboards, ticketing, and more accessible reporting.\nStrengths: Easier to manage, faster delivery, scalable.\nLimitations: Still scoped and scheduled like legacy tests, not truly continuous, reactive by design.\nCost: Lower upfront costs with a subscription-based pricing, but pricing varies widely based do platform features and vendors tend to charge for each test.\nPTaaS\nimproves the testing experience but doesn’t fundamentally change the cadence or mindset of testing.\n3. Bug Bounty\nWhat it is: Incentivized, crowdsourced testing by independent researchers.\nStrengths: Broad attacker creativity.\nLimitations: Inconsistent coverage, duplicate noise, long feedback loops, and lack of strategic context.\nCost: Total spend is unpredictable and can spike with researcher activity. Also, it requires internal resources to tirage and validate.\nBug bounties\ncan catch edge-case bugs but are unreliable as a primary offensive security strategy.\n4. Automated Security Testing\nWhat it is: Tools like SAST, DAST, and scanners integrated into pipelines or production.\nStrengths: Fast, scalable, great for surface-level coverage.\nLimitations: High false positives, lacks human creativity, and don’t emulate real attackers.\nCost: Lower costs than other testing but limited long-term value without human validation.\nAutomation\nis essential, but without human oversight, it misses critical logic flaws, chained exploits, and contextual nuances.\n5. CPT (Continuous Penetration Testing)\nWhat it is: An always-on offensive security approach combining human-led testing with automation. Simulates persistent attackers operating against your attack surface every day, not just once a year.\nStrengths: Real-world attack simulation, contextual findings, real-time alerts and remediation support, unlimited retesting, and reduced time to remediation.\nLimitations: Still requires strategic scoping and internal readiness to act on findings.\nCost: Higher ongoing investment than point-in-time tests, but delivers continuous coverage, unlimited retesting and faster remediation cycles.\nCPT\nintegrates with your teams and aligns with current needs and priorities, reducing remediation lag and keeping exploitation windows short.\nBreak Up with Legacy Penetration Testing—Continuous Is the Way\nLegacy penetration tests have been standard in security for a long time but leave you vulnerable when you’re not actively being tested.\nWith continuous pentesting, you can take a proactive approach to security, addressing vulnerabilities as they arise, and taking action to remediate.\nStay Ahead of Threats with CPT\nThe Rise of CPT\nToday’s exploitation landscape moves at a speed that most testing methods can’t keep up with.\nEach year, over 19,000 critical and high-severity vulnerabilities are disclosed. The\naverage\ntime to weaponize\na newly disclosed vulnerability is just 5 days.\nCompare that to a legacy pentest, which may take 20 days to complete and only happens once or twice a year.\nThat leaves organizations with hundreds of untested, high-risk days, during which attackers have the upper hand.\nAttackers don’t wait for you to schedule your next pentest. They scan, exploit, and pivot 24/7. That’s where a solution like Sprocket Security’s CPT comes into play.\nSprocket's Continuous Security Testing\nOur CPT solution was built to counter this reality. We use a blend of\nattack surface\nmanagement\nand humans to detect change and perform continuous testing that removes time constraints.\nThis more closely simulates the behavior of a persistent attacker and helps teams respond before vulnerabilities become incidents.\nHere’s how Sprocket delivers real-world protection:\nReal-time visibility: Continuous monitoring of vulnerabilities and attack surface changes.\nUnlimited retesting: Retest anytime at no extra cost to quickly verify fixes.\nExpert support: Get remediation and testing guidance from our team, not just reports.\nDecreased exposure time: Reduce the window between vulnerability discovery and remediation, which leads to fewer emergency patches and lower chance of exploitation.\nStay compliant: Always-on testing to meet SOC 2, PCI, ISO, and more.\nCPT doesn’t just find vulnerabilities, but helps you respond faster, patch smarter, and build resilience against the pace of modern threats.\nWhy CPT Is the Future\nCPT aligns security with the speed and persistence of modern development and threats. By combining expert-driven testing with real-time, actionable insights, security teams are empowered to move fast without sacrificing protection, identify real-world attack paths, and build a more resilient system over time.\nCPT also plays a foundational role in enabling\nContinuous Threat Exposure Management\n(CTEM). This proactive strategy is focused on identifying, validating, and remediating risk through its five stages — scoping, discovery, prioritization, validation, and mobilization.\nCPT enhances this framework in powerful ways to help your organization assess threats, validate exposures, and strengthen security.\nIt’s not just testing. It’s continuous, intelligent risk management designed for how attackers operate today.\nReal-World Success: From Annual to Continuous Model\nA Sprocket Security client in the healthcare industry was not satisfied with the coverage their annual pentest was providing them. They moved to our continuous model, which enabled their small security team to detect and remediate risks, helping protect patient data and uphold brand trust year-round! All without increasing their own headcount.\nThis shift didn’t just improve security, but transformed their entire approach to risk. With CPT, the client moved from a reactive, compliance-driven approach to a proactive security strategy that scales with their business.\nToday, they have continuous insights into their threat exposure, faster remediation cycles, and greater confidence that their most sensitive data is protected every day of the year.\nConclusion: Security is a Journey, Not a Snapshot\nSecurity isn’t static and your testing shouldn’t be either. While legacy pentests, PTaaS, bug bounties, and automation each bring a level of value, none offer the consistent, attackerfocused insight that CPT delivers.\nContinuous Penetration Testing is more than a method of testing — it’s a mindset shift. It replaces outdated snapshots with real-time insight and constant attacker-focused validation. It’s how proactive security teams stay ahead, reduce risk, and build long-term resilience.\nSprocket Security is ready to help your organization,\nWatch our platform demo\non-demand or reach out to\nrequest a quote\nfrom our team!\nSponsored and written by\nSprocket Security\n."

        "Content": "The U.S. House of Representatives has banned the installation and use of WhatsApp on government-issued devices belonging to congressional staff, citing concerns over how the app encrypts and secures data.\nThe ban covers mobile phones, laptops, desktop computers, and any web browsers used on those devices.\nCongressional staff are still free to use WhatsApp on their personal devices, which existing policies dictate are not allowed in sensitive areas such as classified briefings or secure facilities.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives is one of the two chambers of the United States Congress, responsible for creating laws, approving budgets, and representing the American public through 435 elected representatives.\nAxios\nfirst reported\non the news of the ban after it got access to a leaked internal email the House's Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) sent to congressional staff, where WhatsApp is essentially classified as a \"high-risk\" communication platform.\nThe U.S. government has not issued an official statement, but CAO Catherine Szpindor later confirmed the initial reporting via a statement to The Verge.\n\"Protecting the People's House is our topmost priority, and we are always monitoring and analyzing for potential cybersecurity risks that could endanger the data of House Members and staff,\" Szpindor told\nThe Verge\n.\nThe CAO told the media outlet that their top priority is protecting the U.S. House and its data, and they regularly review and update the list of approved apps based on cybersecurity risks.\nThis is part of a broader push by the House to restrict potentially risky technology platforms and applications, including ByteDance apps like\nTikTok\nand AI tools like ChatGPT, which is only allowed in a\nspecial version\n.\nThe CAO listed Microsoft Teams, Wickr, Signal, iMessage, and FaceTime as acceptable substitutes for WhatsApp, recommending that staff pick one of these instead.\nIn response to our request for a comment on this development, a WhatsApp spokesperson sent us the below statement.\n\"We disagree with the House Chief Administrative Officer's characterization in the strongest possible terms,\" WhatsApp told BleepingComputer.\n\"We know members and their staff regularly use WhatsApp, and we look forward to ensuring members of the House can join their Senate counterparts officially.\"\n\"Messages on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted by default, meaning only the recipients and not even WhatsApp can see them. This is a higher level of security than most of the apps on the CAO's approved list that do not offer that protection.\"\nWhatsApp recently announced the\nintroduction of ads\nand promoted content in the Updates tab, raising concerns about data privacy, as the platform will now use location, language, and interaction behavior to serve users with targeted ads.\nWhy IT teams are ditching manual patch management\nPatching used to mean complex scripts, long hours, and endless fire drills. Not anymore.\nIn this new guide, Tines breaks down how modern IT orgs are leveling up with automation.
