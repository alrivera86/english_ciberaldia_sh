The remaining 16 misconfigurations have been left to the customers to fix them on their own.\nThe vulnerabilities that have been assigned CVE identifiers are listed below -\nCVE-2025-43697\n(CVSS score: N/A) - If 'Check Field Level Security' is not enabled for 'Extract' and 'Turbo Extract Data Mappers, the 'View Encrypted Data' permission check is not enforced, exposing cleartext values for the encrypted fields to users with access to a given record\nCVE-2025-43698\n(CVSS score: N/A) - The SOQL data source bypasses any Field-Level Security when fetching data from Salesforce objects\nCVE-2025-43699\n(CVSS score: 5.3) - Flexcard does not enforce the 'Required Permissions' field for the OmniUlCard object\nCVE-2025-43700\n(CVSS score: 7.5) - Flexcard does not enforce the 'View Encrypted Data' permission, returning plaintext values for data that uses Classic Encryption\nCVE-2025-43701\n(CVSS score: 7.5) - FlexCard allows Guest Users to access values for Custom Settings\nPut simply, attackers can weaponize these issues to bypass security controls and extract sensitive customer or employee information.\nAppOmni said CVE-2025-43967 and CVE-2025-43698 have been tackled through a new security setting called \"\nEnforceDMFLSAndDataEncryption\n\" that customers will have to enable to ensure that only users with the \"View Encrypted Data\" permission may see the plaintext value of fields returned by the Data Mapper.\n\"For organizations subject to compliance mandates such as HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, or PCI-DSS, these gaps can represent real regulatory exposure,\" the company said. \"And because it is the customer's responsibility to securely configure these settings, a single missed setting could lead to the breach of thousands of records, with no vendor accountability.\"\nWhen reached for comment, a Salesforce spokesperson told The Hacker News that a vast majority of the issues \"stem from customer configuration issues\" and are not vulnerabilities inherent to the application.\n\"All issues identified in this research have been resolved, with patches made available to customers, and official documentation updated to reflect complete configuration functionality,\" the company said. \"We have not observed any evidence of exploitation in customer environments as a result of these issues.\"\nThe disclosure comes as security researcher Tobia Righi, who goes by the handle MasterSplinter,\ndisclosed\na Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) injection vulnerability that could be exploited to access sensitive user data.\nThe zero-day vulnerability (no CVE) exists in a default aura controller present in all Salesforce deployments, arising as a result of a user-controlled \"contentDocumentId\" parameter that's unsafely embedded into \"aura://CsvDataImportResourceFamilyController/ACTION$getCsvAutoMap\" that creates a pathway for SOQL injection.\nSuccessful exploitation of the flaw could have enabled attackers to insert additional queries through the parameter and extract database contents. The exploit could be further\naugmented\nby passing a list of IDs correlated to ContentDocument objects that are not public so as to gather information about uploaded documents.\nThe IDs, Righi said, can be generated by means of a\npublicly-available brute-force script\nthat can generate possible previous or next Salesforce IDs based on a valid input ID. This, in turn, is made possible owing to the fact that Salesforce IDs do not actually provide a security boundary and are actually somewhat predictable.\n\"As noted in the research, after receiving the report, our security team promptly investigated and resolved the issue. We have not observed any evidence of exploitation in customer environments,\" the Salesforce spokesperson said. \"We appreciate Tobia's efforts to responsibly disclose this issue to Salesforce, and we continue to encourage the security research community to report potential issues through our established channels.\"\nFound this article interesting?

A JavaScript-based backdoor, it's capable of enabling credential theft, system access, and follow-on attacks, including ransomware.\nOne of the malware's known customers is FIN6 (aka Camouflage Tempest, Gold Franklin, ITG08, Skeleton Spider, and TA4557), an e-crime crew that\noriginally targeted\npoint-of-sale (PoS) systems in the hospitality and retail sectors to steal payment card details and profit off them. It's operational since 2012.\nThe hacking group also has a history of using\nMagecart JavaScript skimmers\nto target e-commerce sites to harvest financial information.\nAccording to payment card services company Visa, FIN6 has\nleveraged\nMore_eggs as a first-stage payload as far back as 2018 to infiltrate several e-commerce merchants and inject malicious JavaScript code into the checkout pages with the ultimate goal of stealing card data.\n\"Stolen payment card data is later monetized by the group, sold to intermediaries, or sold openly on marketplaces such as JokerStash, prior to it shutting down in early 2021,\" Secureworks\nnotes\nin a profile of the threat actor.\nThe latest activity from FIN6 involves the use of social engineering to\ninitiate contact with recruiters\non professional job platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, posing as job seekers to distribute a link (e.g., bobbyweisman[.]com, ryanberardi[.]com) that purports to host their resume.\nDomainTools said the bogus domains, which masquerade as personal portfolios, are registered anonymously through GoDaddy for an extra layer of obfuscation that makes attribution and takedown efforts more difficult.\n\"By exploiting GoDaddy's domain privacy services, FIN6 further shields the true registrant details from public view and takedown team,\" the company said. \"Although GoDaddy is a reputable and widely used domain registrar, its built-in privacy features make it easy for threat actors to hide their identities.\"\nAnother noteworthy aspect is the use of trusted cloud services, such as AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) or S3, to host phishing sites. What's more, the sites come with built-in traffic filtering logic to ensure that only prospective victims are served a link to download the supposed resume after completing a CAPTCHA check.\n\"Only users appearing to be on residential IP addresses and using common Windows-based browsers are allowed to download the malicious document,\" DomainTools said. \"If the visitor originates from a known VPN service, cloud infrastructure like AWS, or corporate security scanners, the site instead delivers a harmless plain-text version of the resume.\"\nThe downloaded resume takes the form of a ZIP archive that, when opened, triggers an infection sequence to\ndeploy the More_eggs malware\n.\n\"FIN6's Skeleton Spider campaign shows how effective low-complexity phishing campaigns can be when paired with cloud infrastructure and advanced evasion,\" the researchers concluded. \"By using realistic job lures, bypassing scanners, and hiding malware behind CAPTCHA walls, they stay ahead of many detection tools.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a previously undocumented Rust-based information stealer called Myth Stealer that's being propagated via fraudulent gaming websites.\n\"Upon execution, the malware displays a fake window to appear legitimate while simultaneously decrypting and executing malicious code in the background,\" Trellix security researchers Niranjan Hegde, Vasantha Lakshmanan Ambasankar, and Adarsh S\nsaid\nin an analysis.\nThe stealer, initially marketed on Telegram for free under beta in late December 2024, has since transitioned to a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. It's equipped to steal passwords, cookies, and autofill information from both Chromium- and Gecko-based browsers, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, and Mozilla Firefox.\nThe operators of the malware have been found maintaining a number of Telegram channels to advertise the sale of compromised accounts as well as provide testimonials of their service. These channels have been shut down by Telegram.\nEvidence shows that Myth Stealer is distributed through fake websites, including one hosted on Google's Blogger, offering various video games under the pretext of testing them. It's worth noting that a near-identical Blogger page has been used to deliver another stealer malware known as\nAgeoStealer\n, as disclosed by Flashpoint in April 2025.\nTrellix said it also discovered the malware being distributed as a cracked version of a game cheating software called DDrace in an online forum, highlighting the myriad distribution vehicles.\nRegardless of the initial access vector, the downloaded loader displays a fake setup window to the user to deceive them into thinking that a legitimate application is executed. In the background, the loader decrypts and launches the stealer component.\nIn a 64-bit DLL file, the stealer attempts to terminate running processes associated with various web browsers before stealing the data and exfiltrating it to a remote server, or, in some cases, to a Discord webhook.\n\"It also contains anti-analysis techniques such as string obfuscation and system checks using filenames and usernames,\" the researchers said. \"The malware authors regularly update stealer code to evade AV detection and introduce additional functionality such as screen capture capability and clipboard hijacking.\"\nMyth Stealer is by no means alone when it comes to using game cheat lures to distribute malware. Last week, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 shed light on another Windows malware referred to as Blitz that's spread through backdoored game cheats and cracked installers for legitimate programs.\nPrimarily propagated via an attacker-controlled Telegram channel, Blitz consists of two stages: A downloader that's responsible for a bot payload, which is designed to log keystrokes, take screenshots, download/upload files, and inject code. It also comes fitted with a denial-of-service (DoS) function against web servers and drops an XMRig miner.\nThe backdoored cheat performs anti-sandbox checks before retrieving the malware's next stage, with the downloader only running when the victim logs in again after logging out or a reboot. The downloader is also configured to run the same anti-sandbox checks prior to dropping the bot payload.\nWhat's notable about the attack chain is that the Blitz bot and XMR cryptocurrency miner payloads, along with components of its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, are hosted in a Hugging Face Space. Hugging Face has locked the user account following responsible disclosure.\nAs of late April 2025, Blitz is estimated to have amassed 289 infections in 26 countries, led by Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Last month, the threat actor behind Blitz claimed on their Telegram channel that they are hanging up the boots after they apparently found that the cheat had a trojan embedded in it. They also provided a removal tool to wipe the malware from victim systems.\n\"The person behind Blitz malware appears to be a Russian speaker who uses the moniker sw1zzx on social media platforms,\" Unit 42\nsaid\n. \"This malware operator is likely the developer of Blitz.\"\nThe development comes as CYFIRMA detailed a new C#-based remote access trojan (RAT) named DuplexSpy RAT that comes with extensive capabilities for surveillance, persistence, and system control. It was\npublished\non GitHub in April 2025, claiming it's intended for \"educational and ethical demonstration only.\"\nBlitz infection chain\n\"It establishes persistence via startup folder replication and Windows registry modifications while employing fileless execution and privilege escalation techniques for stealth,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"Key features include keylogging, screen capture, webcam/audio spying, remote shell, and anti-analysis functions.\"\nBesides featuring the ability to remotely play audio or system sounds on the victim's machine, DuplexSpy RAT incorporates a power control module that makes it possible for the attacker to remotely execute system-level commands on the compromised host, such as shutdown, restart, logout, and sleep.\n\"[The malware] enforces a fake lock screen by displaying an attacker-supplied image (Base64-encoded) in full screen while disabling user interaction,\" CYFIRMA added. \"It prevents closure unless explicitly permitted, simulating a system freeze or ransom notice to manipulate or extort the victim.\"\nThe findings also follow a report from Positive Technologies that\nmultiple threat actors\n, including\nTA558\n,\nBlind Eagle\n,\nAggah\n(aka\nHagga\n),\nPhaseShifters\n(aka Angry Likho, Sticky Werewolf, and UAC-0050),\nUAC-0050\n, and\nPhantomControl\n, are using a crypter-as-a-service offering called\nCrypters And Tools\nto obfuscate files like Ande Loader.\nAttack chains using Crypters And Tools have targeted the United States, Eastern Europe (including Russia), and Latin America. One platform where the crypter is sold is nitrosoftwares[.]com, which also offers various tools, including exploits, crypters, loggers, and cryptocurrency clippers, among others.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Modern enterprise networks are highly complex environments that rely on hundreds of apps and infrastructure services. These systems need to interact securely and efficiently without constant human oversight, which is where non-human identities (NHIs) come in. NHIs — including application secrets, API keys, service accounts, and OAuth tokens — have exploded in recent years, thanks to an ever-expanding array of apps and services that must work together and identify one another on the fly. In some enterprises, NHIs now outnumber human identities by as much as\n50-to-1\n.\nHowever, NHIs introduce unique risks and management challenges that have security leaders on high alert. Forty-six percent of organizations have experienced compromises of NHI accounts or credentials over the past year, and another 26% suspect they have, according to a\nrecent report from Enterprise Strategy Group\n.\nIt's no wonder NHIs — and the difficulties they present with oversight, risk reduction, and governance — have been a recurring topic at Okta's CISO Forum. Here, we'll explore their rise, risks, and how CISOs and security leaders are managing them today.\nThe spectacular rise of NHIs\nThe rise in NHIs can be traced to the increasing use of cloud services, AI and automation, and digital workflows. It's a trend that's likely to continue, as more and more tasks are automated and humans are less of a part of the equation.\nNHIs allow apps to authenticate to one another, both inside a specific domain and with third-party applications like cloud services. Those secrets, keys, and tokens are just as sensitive as the credentials used by humans, and in some cases, even more so, as they can provide adversaries with powerful access to specific applications and services if they're leaked.\nCISOs are taking notice. In fact, over 80% of organizations expect to\nincrease spending on non-human identity security\n.\nAccording to Mark Sutton, CISO at Bain Capital, \"Non-human identities have become a focus for teams based on the maturity of their identity and access management programs. It's quickly becoming the next hottest fire because people have somewhat solved user identities. The natural progression is then to start looking at service accounts and machine-to-machine non-human identities, including APIs.\"\nSimply put, once organizations establish strong protocols for securing human identities, the logical next step is tackling NHIs. \"That, and non-human identities are a part of the threat landscape, and it's where attackers are going next.\"\nSecret leakage and other risks of NHIs\nLike any other set of credentials, NHIs are sensitive and need to be protected. But while humans can employ robust security measures such as MFA or biometrics to protect sensitive credentials, NHIs often rely on less secure measures for authentication. That can make them easy targets for attackers.\nLeakage of NHI secrets can also be a serious concern. This can happen in a number of ways, whether it's through hard-coding them into an application's source code or accidentally copying and pasting them into a public document. Secret leakage is a significant problem, and secrets often show up in public GitHub repositories. In fact, security firm\nGitGuardian found more than 27 million new secrets\nin public repositories last year. This poses an even larger problem when you consider that NHI secrets are not rotated very often in most environments, so the useful life of a leaked secret could be quite long.\nAnd, because they often require broad and persistent permissions to perform tasks, NHIs can accumulate excessive permissions, further increasing the attack surface. All of this makes NHIs a prime target for attackers and a major challenge for CISOs and their security teams.\nThree challenges CISOs face in securing NHIs\nWhile NHIs are now on CISOs' radar, securing them is another story. Here are three challenges we're hearing from CISOs, and how they're managing them:\nGaining visibility. The biggest hurdle in trying to secure and manage NHIs is actually finding them. Visibility into where NHIs lie in an environment can be limited, and discovering all or even most of them is a difficult task. Many organizations have thousands of NHIs that they didn't even know existed. The old adage \"you can't secure what you don't know about\" holds true here. That means discovering and inventorying NHIs is critical. Implementing an\nidentity security posture management\nsolution can help admins and security professionals identify NHIs across their organization.\nRisk prioritization and reduction. The next challenge is prioritizing the risks associated with the NHIs in the environment. Not all NHIs are created equal. Finding the most powerful NHIs and identifying over-privileged NHIs is a key step in securing these identities. Many service accounts and other NHIs have far more privileges than they actually need, which can create risks for the organization. Identifying high-value NHIs and adjusting privileges and permissions can help reduce that risk. \"It's about understanding the blast radius associated with each non-human identity and asking 'what's the risk?' Not all NHIs carry the same threat,\" Sutton stressed.\nEstablishing governance. With so many NHIs being created today, governance has become a real thorn in the side for CISOs. But when they're not properly governed, bad things can happen — take, for instance, the\nseries of Internet Archive breaches tied to unrotated tokens\nin October 2024. Often, NHIs are created by developers to serve short-term needs, but they're rarely tracked or decommissioned properly. Understanding who's creating NHIs, how they're creating them, and for what purpose is a good first step. Then, security teams must establish a clear process for managing them so non-human identities can't be created arbitrarily. \"We have to think about what our authentication and password policies are,\" says Sutton. \"For instance, there are likely many service accounts with weak, static passwords that haven't been rotated for years. How do we make sure we're managing those?\"\nFinal thoughts\nNon-human identities are essential to businesses today, helping them automate processes, enable integrations, and ensure smooth operations. The challenge: They're difficult to secure and are an enticing target for threat actors because they're often non-federated, lack MFA, use static credentials, and have excessive privileges.\nAt the end of the day, non-human identities and human identities may have different characteristics and needs, but both require an end-to-end approach that protects them before, during, and after authentication. NHIs may not be people, but they're increasingly powerful actors in your environment. That makes securing them not optional, but urgent.\nJoin our webcast on August 18th\nto learn how organizations are reducing risk and complexity by managing all identities — human or not — under one unified system.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

It's believed to be active at least since 2019.\nAccording to BI.ZONE, the threat actor\nobtains\ninitial access using phishing emails, leveraging the foothold to steal documents, Telegram messenger data, and drop tools like\nMipko Employee Monitor\n,\nWebBrowserPassView\n, and Defender Control to interact with the infected system, harvest passwords, and disable antivirus software.\nThe latest set of attacks documented by Kaspersky reveals the use of phishing emails as a malware delivery vehicle, using password-protected archives containing executable files as a starting point to activate the infection.\nPresent within the archive is an installer that's used to deploy a legitimate tool called 4t Tray Minimizer, as well as other payloads, including a decoy PDF document that mimics a payment order.\n\"This software can minimize running applications to the system tray, allowing attackers to obscure their presence on the compromised system,\" Kaspersky said.\nThese intermediate payloads are then used to fetch additional files from a remote server, including Defender Control and\nBlat\n, a legitimate utility for sending stolen data to an attacker-controlled email address over SMTP. The attacks are also characterized by the use of the AnyDesk remote desktop software, and a Windows batch script to facilitate data theft and the deployment of the miner.\nA salient aspect of the batch script is that it launches a PowerShell script that incorporates capabilities for automatically waking up the victim system at 1 a.m. local time and allowing the attackers remote access to it for a four-hour window via AnyDesk. The machine is then shut down at 5 a.m. by means of a scheduled task.\n\"It is a common technique to leverage third-party legitimate software for malicious purposes, which makes detecting and attributing APT activity more difficult,\" Kaspersky said. \"All of the malicious functionality still relies on the installer, command, and PowerShell scripts.\"\nThe disclosure comes as Positive Technologies\nrevealed\nthat a financially motivated cybercrime group dubbed DarkGaboon has been targeting Russian entities using LockBit 3.0 ransomware. DarkGaboon,\nfirst discovered\nin January 2025, is said to be operational since May 2023.\nThe attacks, the company said, employ phishing emails bearing archive files containing RTF bait documents and Windows screensaver files to drop the LockBit encryptor and trojans like XWorm and\nRevenge RAT\n. The use of readily available tooling is seen as an attempt on the part of the attackers to blend in with broader cybercriminal activity and challenge attribution efforts.\n\"DarkGaboon is not a client of the LockBit RaaS service and acts independently, as indicated by the use of a publicly available version of the LockBit ransomware, the absence of traces of data exfiltration in the attacked companies, and the traditional threats to publish stolen information on the [data leak site] portal,\" Positive Technologies researcher Victor Kazakov said.\nFound this article interesting?

(Fixed in April 2025 in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20)\nCVE-2024-42009\n(CVSS score: 9.3) - A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in RoundCube Webmail that could allow a remote attacker to steal and send emails of a victim via a crafted email message by taking advantage of a desanitization issue in program/actions/mail/show.php. (Fixed in August 2024 in versions 1.6.8 and 1.5.8)\nThere are currently no details on how the two vulnerabilities are exploited in the wild, and by whom. Last month, ESET\nrevealed\nthat the Russia-linked threat actor known as APT28 exploited several XSS flaws in Roundcube, Horde, MDaemon, and Zimbra to target governmental entities and defense companies in Eastern Europe. It's not clear if the abuse of CVE-2024-42009 is related to this activity or something else.\nAccording to data from Censys, there are\n340 exposed Erlang servers\n, although it bears noting that not all instances are necessarily susceptible to the flaw. The public disclosure of CVE-2025-32433 has been quickly followed by the\nrelease\nof several\nproof-of-concept\n(PoC) exploits for it.\nIn light of active exploitation, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to apply the necessary fixes by June 30, 2025, for optimal protection.\nThe development comes as Patchstack\nflagged\nan unpatched account takeover vulnerability in the PayU CommercePro plugin for WordPress (CVE-2025-31022, CVSS score: 9.8) that enables an attacker to seize control of any user of a site without any authentication.\nThis can have serious consequences when the attacker is able to hijack an administrator account, permitting them to take over the site and perform malicious actions. The vulnerability affects versions 3.8.5 and before. The plugin has over\n5,000 active installations\n.\nThe problem has to do with a function called \"update_cart_data(),\" which, in turn, is invoked from an endpoint named \"/payu/v1/get-shipping-cost\" that checks if a provided email address exists, and if so, processes the e-commerce order for checkout.\nBut because the endpoint checks for a valid token linked to a hard-coded email address (\"commerce.pro@payu[.]in\") and there exists another REST API to generate an authentication token for a given email (\"/payu/v1/generate-user-token\"), an attacker could exploit this behavior to obtain the token corresponding to \"commerce.pro@payu[.]in\" and send a request to \"/payu/v1/get-shipping-cost\" to hijack any account.\nUsers are advised to deactivate and delete the plugin until a patch for the vulnerability is made available.\n\"It is necessary to ensure that the unauthenticated REST API endpoints are not overly permissive and provide more access to the users,\" Patchstack said. \"Also, hard-coding sensitive or dynamic information such as email addresses to use it for other cases inside the codebase is not recommended.\"\nFound this article interesting?

This ensures that code has not been tampered with before it reaches the end user.\nAccording to ConnectWise, the decision was taken after a third-party security researcher raised concerns about how certain configuration data can be abused by threat actors.\n\"We are updating the digital signing certificates used in ConnectWise ScreenConnect, Automate, and RMM due to concerns raised by a third-party researcher about how ScreenConnect could potentially be misused by a bad actor,\" reads an email seen by BleepingComputer.\n\"This potential misuse relates to a configuration handling issue with the ScreenConnect installer which would require system-level access.\"\nConnectWise underlines that the action is unrelated to any security incidents, specifically not the\nnation-state cyberattack\nit suffered last month.\n\"In addition to issuing new certificates, we are releasing an update to improve how this configuration data is managed in ScreenConnect,\" further explains an\nadvisory on its website\n.\nThe certificates in question are issued by DigiCert, who initially were going to revoke ConnectWise's certificates on Tuesday, June 10 at 10:00 PM ET.  However, ConnectWise was able to get an extension to Friday, June 13, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET, likely because the new ScreenConnect version 25.4 build that utilizes the new certificates was not available.\nThe action will affect both on-premises and cloud users, who must meet the deadline to avoid operational disruptions.\nConnectWise says the Automate build is already out, while the ScreenConnect build should be ready soon.\nUsers are recommended to visit the vendor's 'University page' to download the updated builds and find instructions and FAQs.\nThose using cloud-hosted versions of Automate, ScreenConnect, or RMM, ConnectWise will automatically receive updates to certificates and agents, but the roll-out is taking place progressively.\nThese users should still check that their agents are up to date before June 13 to ensure uninterrupted service.\nWhile ConnectWise did not share details on why the certificates were being rotated, Sophos researcher Andrew Brandt warned in April that threat actors were using phishing sites to push pre-configured ConnectWise clients disguised as Social Security statements [\nVirusTotal\n].\n\"A spammer has been delivering a ConnectWise commercial remote access client application as a payload in a scam that uses the purported arrival of a US Social Security statement as its hook,\"\nexplained Brandt on Mastodon\n.\nEven though these installers were\npre-configured with the attackers's server\n, they still showed as digitally signed, adding additional trust to the executable.\nIt is unclear if attacks like this led to the rotation of the code signing certificates.\nBleepingComputer contacted ConnectWise to ask if it was related and to learn more about why the certificates were being rotated, but we were just referred back to the advisory.\nWhy IT teams are ditching manual patch management\nPatching used to mean complex scripts, long hours, and endless fire drills.

If an attacker has admin rights to an operating system, they can modify this variable so arbitrary data is written to memory locations during the UEFI boot process. This is done before the operating system, or even the kernel, is loaded.\nUsing this vulnerability, Binarly created a proof-of-concept exploit to zero out the 'gSecurity2' global variable, which is used to enforce Secure Boot.\n\"For our proof of concept (PoC), we chose to overwrite the global variable gSecurity2,\" explains the\nBinarly report\n.\n\"This variable holds a pointer to the Security2 Architectural Protocol, which the LoadImage function uses to enforce Secure Boot. By setting it to zero, we eectively disable Secure Boot, allowing the execution of any unsigned UEFI modules.\"\nOnce disabled, attackers can install bootkit malware that can hide from the operating system and turn off further security features.\nTo fix CVE-2025-3052, Microsoft has added the affected module hashes to the Secure Boot dbx revocation list. Binarly and Microsoft urge users to install the updated dbx file immediately through today's security updates to protect their devices.\nAlso today, another Secure Boot bypass affecting UEFI-compatible firmware based on Insyde H2O was disclosed by Nikolaj Schlej. The flaw,\ndubbed Hydroph0bia\nand tracked as CVE-2025-4275, was reported to Insyde and patched 90 days after disclosure.\nBinarly has shared a video demonstrating how their PoC can disable Secure Boot and cause a message to display before the operating system boots.\nWhy IT teams are ditching manual patch management\nPatching used to mean complex scripts, long hours, and endless fire drills.

        "Content": "Microsoft announced it will expand the list of blocked attachments in Outlook Web and the new Outlook for Windows starting next month.\nThe company said on Monday in a Microsoft 365 Message Center update that Outlook will block .library-ms and .search-ms file types beginning in July.\n\"As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance security in Outlook Web and the New Outlook for Windows, we're updating the default list of blocked file types in OwaMailboxPolicy,\"\nMicrosoft said\n. \"Starting in early July 2025, the [.library-ms and .search-ms] file types will be added to the BlockedFileTypes list.\"\nWindows Library files (.library-ms), which define virtual collections of folders and files in the Windows file system, were\nused earlier this year\nin phishing attacks targeting government entities and private companies to exploit a Windows vulnerability (\nCVE-2025-24054\n) that exposes NTLM hashes.\nThe .search-ms URI protocol handler has also been exploited in\nphishing\nand\nmalware\nattacks since at least June 2022, when Hacker House co-founder and security researcher Matthew Hickey found that it could be used to\nautomatically launch Windows Search windows\non recipients' devices to trick them into launching malware when chained with a Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) remote code execution vulnerability (\nCVE-2022-30190\n).\n\"The newly blocked file types are rarely used, so most organizations will not be affected by the change. However, if your users are sending and receiving affected attachments, they will report that they are no longer able to open or download them in Outlook Web or the New Outlook for Windows,\" the company added on Monday.\n\"No action is required if your organization does not rely on these file types. The update will automatically apply to all OWA Mailbox policies in your organization. If your organization needs to allow these file types, you can add them to the AllowedFileTypes property of your users' OwaMailboxPolicy objects before the rollout.\"\nYou can find the complete list of blocked Outlook attachments on\nMicrosoft's documentation website\n. Enterprise users with a Microsoft Exchange Server account can ask Exchange Server administrators to adjust security settings for their mailboxes to accept attachments blocked by Outlook if they can't be shared as an archive, using a different extension, or using OneDrive or SharePoint.\nThis move is part of a much broader effort to remove or turn off Office and Windows features that have been abused and exploited to infect Microsoft customers with malware.\nIt started in 2018 when Microsoft\nexpanded support for its Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI)\nto Office 365 client apps to block attacks using Office VBA macros.\nSince then, the company began\nblocking VBA Office macros\nby default,\ndisabled Excel 4.0 (XLM) macros\n, introduced\nXLM macro protection\n, and started\nblocking untrusted XLL add-ins by default\nacross Microsoft 365 tenants.\nMicrosoft also announced in May 2024 that it would\nkill off VBScript\nand\ndisabled all ActiveX controls\nin Windows versions of Microsoft 365 and Office 2024 applications in April 2025.\nWhy IT teams are ditching manual patch management\nPatching used to mean complex scripts, long hours, and endless fire drills.

        "Content": "In a twist on typical hiring-related social engineering attacks, the FIN6 hacking group impersonates job seekers to target recruiters, using convincing resumes and phishing sites to deliver malware.\nFIN6 (aka \"Skeleton Spider\") is a hacking group that was initially known for conducting financial fraud, including compromising point-of-sale (PoS) systems to steal credit cards. However, in 2019, the threat actors\nexpanded into ransomware attacks\n, joining existing operations like Ryuk and Lockergoga.\nThe group has recently used social engineering campaigns to deliver '\nMore Eggs\n,' a malware-as-a-service JavaScript backdoor used for credential theft, system access, and ransomware deployment.\nAttack process\nIn a\nnew report by DomainTools\n, researchers detail how FIN6 is switching up the typical employment scam by impersonating job seekers to target recruiters rather than posing as recruiters to lure job applicants.\nHiding behind fake job seeker personas, they approach recruiters and HR departments via messages on LinkedIn and Indeed, where they build rapport before they follow up with phishing emails.\nThese emails, which are professionally crafted, contain non-clickable URLs to their \"resume sites\" to evade detection and blocking, forcing the recipients to type them on their browsers manually.\nEmail sent to targets\nSource: DomainTools\nThe domains, which are registered anonymously through GoDaddy, are hosted in AWS, a trusted cloud service that is not commonly flagged by security tools.\nExamples of domains used by FIN6 in this campaign are listed below, named after the fake personas used for the attacks:\nbobbyweisman[.]com\nemersonkelly[.]com\ndavidlesnick[.]com\nkimberlykamara[.]com\nannalanyi[.]com\nbobbybradley[.]net\nmalenebutler[.]com\nlorinash[.]com\nalanpower[.]net\nedwarddhall[.]com\nFIN6 has also added environmental fingerprinting and behavioral checks to ensure that only their targets can open the landing pages containing their professional portfolio.\nVPN or cloud connections and attempts to visit from Linux or macOS are blocked and instead serve innocuous content.\nQualified victims get a fake CAPTCHA step before they are prompted to download a ZIP archive allegedly containing a resume but actually contains a disguised Windows shortcut file (LNK) that executes a script to download the \"More Eggs\" backdoor.\nCAPTCHA step on the landing page\nSource: DomainTools\nMore Eggs, created by a threat actor called \"Venom Spider,\" is a modular backdoor capable of command execution, credential theft, delivery of additional payloads, and PowerShell execution.\nFIN6's attack is simple yet very effective, relying on social engineering and advanced evasion.\nRecruiters and human resources employees should approach invites to review resumes and portfolios with caution, especially if they request you visit an external site to download a resume.\nCompanies and recruiting agencies should also try to independently confirm a person's identity by contacting their references or people at companies they list as current/former employers before engaging further.\nWhy IT teams are ditching manual patch management\nPatching used to mean complex scripts, long hours, and endless fire drills.

        "Content": "AI is everywhere. Copilots help employees boost productivity, and agents provide front-line customer support. LLMs enable businesses to extract deep insights from their data.\nOnce unleashed, however, AI acts like a hungry Pac-Man, scanning and analyzing all the data it can grab. If AI surfaces critical data where it doesn’t belong, it’s game over. Data can’t be unbreached.\nAnd AI isn’t alone — sprawling cloud complexities, unsanctioned apps, missing MFA, and more risks are creating a ticking time bomb for enterprise data. Organizations that lack proper data security measures risk a catastrophic breach of their sensitive information.\nTo quantify AI’s impact on data risk, Varonis produced the\nState of Data Security Report: Quantifying AI’s Impact on Data Risk\n. Download the full report and continue reading to learn about the latest risks to data.\nResearchers set out to capture the human-to-machine risk factors: how much sensitive data (employee salaries, R&D information, source code, and more) copilots and agents can access or expose with one prompt.\nResearchers also looked at machine-to-machine risks: the integrity of the data used to feed LLMs. Incorrect data can trigger disastrous effects. Manipulated clinical data could undermine the development of breakthrough medicine. Bad actors can silently embed malicious code within LLMs.\nDownload the Varonis 2025 State of Data Security Report\nOur team analyzed data from 1,000 real-world IT environments and found that no organization was breach-proof.\nIn fact, 99% of organizations have exposed sensitive data that can easily be surfaced by AI.\nRead the report\nA data risk deep dive\nVaronis analyzed data from 1,000 data risk assessments to provide empirical evidence of risk, not conclusions based on AI readiness surveys and polls.\nThe State of Data Security Report deep dives into the data risks associated with AI, cloud environments, and some of the most popular SaaS apps and services, such as Microsoft 365, AWS, Snowflake, Box, Salesforce, and many others.\nVaronis found:\n99% of organizations have sensitive data unnecessarily exposed to AI tools\n90% of sensitive cloud data, including AI training data, is open and accessible to AI tools\n98% have unverified apps, including shadow AI, within their environments\n1 in 7 do not enforce MFA across SaaS and multi-cloud environments\n88% have ghost users lurking in their environments\nTaken together, researchers found that no organization was fully prepared for AI. All 1,000 organizations examined were at risk of a breach in the AI era.\n“AI is shining a light on data risk,” said Matt Radolec, Varonis VP of Incident Response and Cloud Operations. “Organizations are adopting AI without fully understanding the permissions models, and that means data can be exposed unintentionally to employees, other users, and even externally.”\nThe report outlines three ways organizations can take proactive steps to secure their data for AI:\nReduce your blast radius by proactively decreasing the damage attackers can do with a stolen identity.\nContinuously monitor your data, automate access governance and posture management, and employ proactive threat detection.\nUse AI and automation. IT and security teams can harness AI and automation to remediate issues and vulnerabilities.\nVaronis’ analysis revealed that the vast majority of organizations, regardless of size or sector, struggle to maintain robust data security practices. As AI continues to evolve, it is crucial for organizations to prioritize data protection and implement effective security measures.\nDownload the\nState of Data Security Report: Quantifying AI’s Impact on Data Risk.\nSponsored and written by\nVaronis\n."

        "Content": "A threat actor is allegedly selling Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to a construction company based in Saudi Arabia. In a post on a specialized forum, the seller provided details about the target, identifying it as a firm within the Commercial & Residential Construction industry with a stated revenue of $273.4 million. The sale of direct network credentials presents a serious risk to the targeted organization.\nThe RDP access is being offered for a starting price of $1,000. RDP allows a user to control a computer or server remotely, meaning a malicious actor could gain a direct foothold inside the company’s network. This could be used to execute further attacks, such as deploying ransomware or stealing sensitive corporate data. The post also notes the company uses Sophos antivirus and that the seller is open to a “collaboration for %,” indicating a potential partnership to exploit the alleged access for a share of the profits.\nWhile the specific identity of the company remains unknown, the listing itself is a security alert for organizations in the region. The claims made by the threat actor have not been independently verified.\nTags:\nConstruction\ncyberattack\nCyberSecurity\ndata-breach\nRDP access\nSaudi Arabia\nthreat actor"

The file names suggest that everything from internal administrative records to student and faculty data has been stolen. This level of access could expose the personal information of the entire academic community associated with the polytechnic and disrupt institutional operations.\nThe allegedly leaked files indicate the following datasets were compromised:\nStudent and Teacher/Lecturer Data (\nsiswa.csv\n,\nguru.csv\n)\nUser Accounts (\nuser.csv\n)\nStudy Programs, Departments, and Scholarships (\nprodi.csv\n,\njurusan.csv\n,\nbeasiswa.csv\n)\nNew Student Admissions and Promotions (\npmb.csv\n,\npromopmb.csv\n)\nInstitutional Information (Profiles, History, Vision & Mission, Structure, Facilities)\nCareer Center Data (Profiles, Structure, Vision & Mission)\nAlumni Tracking Data (\nlaptracer.csv\n)\nContact Lists and Guestbook Entries (\nkontak.csv\n,\nbukutamu.csv\n)\nFoundation and Announcement Records (\nyayasan.csv\n,\npengumuman.csv\n)\nTags:\nCyberSecurity\ndata-breach\nEducation\nhacktivism\nIndonesia\nPoliteknik Tonggak Equator"

        "Content": "A threat actor has allegedly leaked a significant database from Ghana’s insurance sector on a dark web forum. The actor released a 213 MB SQL file named “Ghana Insurance database,” which reportedly contains a vast collection of sensitive records. If validated, this incident could pose a severe threat to the privacy of numerous individuals and challenge the security posture of the country’s insurance industry, as the data is now accessible to malicious actors.\nThe exact origin of the database remains unconfirmed. However, a data sample shared by the threat actor included a customer record from “Priority Insurance Company Limited,” a known insurance provider in Ghana. The generic title of the database suggests that the breach could be extensive, potentially containing records from more than just a single company. This raises concerns about the security of shared data hubs or third-party service providers within the region’s insurance ecosystem.\nThe exposed information allegedly includes a wide array of personally identifiable information (PII) that could be exploited for fraud. The leak puts affected policyholders at a heightened risk of sophisticated phishing attacks, identity theft, and other financial scams. According to the sample, the allegedly compromised data fields include:\nFull Names\nPhone Numbers\nBranch and Company Names\nResidential, Postal, and Digital Addresses\nCustomer and National ID numbers\nDate of Birth\nOccupation\nPolicy and Branch details\nTags:\nCyberSecurity\ndata-breach\ndata-leak\nGhana\nInsurance"
