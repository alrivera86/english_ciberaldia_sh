        "Content": "In the wake of high-profile attacks on UK retailers Marks & Spencer and Co-op, Scattered Spider has been all over the media, with coverage spilling over into the mainstream news due to the severity of the disruption caused — currently looking like hundreds of millions in lost profits for M&S alone.\nThis coverage is extremely valuable for the cybersecurity community as it raises awareness of the battles that security teams are fighting every day. But it's also created a lot of noise that can make it tricky to understand the big picture.\nThe headline story from the recent campaign against UK retailers is the use of help desk scams. This typically involves the attacker calling up a company's help desk with some level of information — at minimum, PII that allows them to impersonate their victim, and sometimes a password, leaning heavily on their native English-speaking abilities to trick the help desk operator into giving them access to a user account.\nHelp Desk Scams 101\nThe goal of a help desk scam is to get the help desk operator to reset the credentials and/or MFA used to access an account so the attacker can take control of it. They'll use a variety of backstories and tactics to get that done, but most of the time it's as simple as saying \"I've got a new phone, can you remove my existing MFA and allow me to enroll a new one?\"\nFrom there, the attacker is then sent an MFA reset link via email or SMS. Usually, this would be sent to, for example, a number on file — but at this point, the attacker has already established trust and bypassed the help desk process to a degree. So asking \"Can you send it to this email address\" or \"I've actually got a new number too, can you send it to…\" gets this sent directly to the attacker.\nAt this point, it's simply a case of using the self-service password reset functionality for Okta or Entra (which you can get around because you now have the MFA factor to verify yourself), and\nvoila\n, the attacker has taken control of the account.\nAnd the best part? Most help desks have the same process for every account — it doesn't matter who you're impersonating or which account you're trying to reset. So, attackers are specifically targeting accounts likely to have top-tier admin privileges — meaning once they get in, progressing the attack is trivial, and much of the typical privilege escalation and lateral movement is removed from the attack path.\nSo, help desk scams have proved to be a reliable way of bypassing MFA and achieving account takeover — the foothold from which to launch the rest of an attack, such as stealing data, deploying ransomware, etc.\nDon't be fooled — this isn't a new development\nBut something that's not quite coming across in the reporting is that Scattered Spider has been doing this successfully since 2022, with the M&S and Co-op attacks merely the tip of the iceberg. Vishing (calling a user to get them to give up their MFA code) has been a part of their toolkit since the beginning, with the early attacks on Twilio, LastPass, Riot Games, and Coinbase involving some form of voice-based social engineering.\nNotably, the high-profile attacks on Caesars, MGM Resorts, and Transport for London all involved calling a help desk to reset credentials as the initial access vector.\nCaesars\nin August 2023 where hackers impersonated an IT user and convinced an outsourced help desk to reset credentials, after which the attacker stole the customer loyalty program database and secured a $15m ransom payment.\nMGM Resorts\nin September 2023, where the hacker used LinkedIn information to impersonate an employee and reset the employee's credentials, resulting in a 6TB data theft. After MGM refused to pay, the attack eventually resulted in a 36-hour outage, a $100m hit, and a class-action lawsuit settled for $45m.\nTransport for London\nin September 2024 resulted in 5,000 users' bank details being exposed, 30,000 staff required to attend in-person appointments to verify their identities and reset passwords, and significant disruption to online services lasting for months.\nSo not only have Scattered Spider (and other threat groups) been using these techniques for some time, but the severity and impact of these attacks have been ramping up.\nAvoiding help desk gotchas\nThere's lots of advice for securing help desks being circulated, but much of the advice still results in a process that is either phishable or difficult to implement.\nUltimately, organizations need to be prepared to introduce friction to their help desk process and either delay or deny requests in situations where there's significant risk. So, for example, having a process for MFA reset that recognizes the risk associated with resetting a high-privileged account:\nRequire multi-party approval/escalation for admin-level account resets\nRequire in-person verification if the process can't be followed remotely\nFreeze self-service resets when suspicious behavior is encountered (this would require some kind of internal process and awareness training to raise the alarm if an attack is suspected)\nAnd watch out for these gotchas:\nIf you receive a call, good practice is to terminate the call and dial the number on file for the employee. But, in a world of SIM swapping, this isn't a foolproof solution — you could just be re-dialing the attacker.\nIf your solution is to get the employee on camera, increasingly sophisticated deepfakes can thwart this approach.\nBut, help desks are a target for a reason. They're \"helpful\" by nature. This is usually reflected in how they're operated and performance measured — delays won't help you to hit those SLAs! Ultimately, a process only works if employees are willing to adhere to it — and can't be socially engineered to break it. Help desks that are removed from day-to-day operations (especially when outsourced or offshored) are also inherently susceptible to attacks where employees are impersonated.\nBut, the attacks we're experiencing at the moment should give security stakeholders plenty of ammunition as to why help desk reforms are vital to securing the business (and what can happen if you don't make changes).\nComparing help desk scams with other approaches\nTaking a step back, it's worth thinking about how help desk scams fit into the wider toolkit of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors like Scattered Spider.\nScattered Spider has heavily relied on identity-based TTPs since they first emerged in 2022, following a repeatable path of bypassing MFA, achieving account takeover on privileged accounts, stealing data from cloud services, and deploying ransomware (principally to VMware environments).\nCredential phishing via email and SMS (smishing) to harvest passwords en masse\nUsing SIM swapping (where you get the carrier to transfer a number to your attacker-controlled SIM card) to bypass SMS-based MFA\nUsing\nMFA fatigue\n(aka. push bombing) to bypass app-based push authentication\nUsing vishing (i.e. directly calling a victim to social engineer their MFA code, as opposed to a help desk attack)\nSocial engineering domain registrars to take control of the target organization's DNS, hijacking their MX records and inbound mail, and using this to take over the company's business app environments\nAnd latterly, using\nMFA-bypass AiTM phishing kits like Evilginx\nto steal live user sessions, bypassing all common forms of MFA (with the exception of WebAuthn/FIDO2)\nScattered Spider phishing pages running Evilginx. Source: Researchers at\nSilentPush\nSo, help desk scams are an important part of their toolkit, but it's not the whole picture. Methods like AiTM in particular have spiked in popularity this year as a reliable and scalable way of bypassing MFA and achieving account takeover, with attackers using these toolkits as the de facto standard, getting creative in their detection evasion methods and in some cases, evading standard delivery vectors like email altogether to ensure the success of their phishing campaigns.\nLearn more about how modern phishing kits are evading detection controls in this on-demand webinar from Push Security.\nScattered Spider are consciously evading established security controls\nSo, there's more to Scattered Spider's toolkit than just help desk scams. In fact, their approach can be broadly classified as\nconsciously evading established controls\nat the endpoint and network layer\nby targeting identities\n.\nFrom the point of account takeover, they also follow repeatable patterns:\nHarvesting and exfiltrating data from cloud and SaaS services, where monitoring is typically less consistent than traditional on-premise environments, and exfiltration often blends in with normal activity. Many organizations simply don't have the logs or visibility to detect malicious activity in the cloud anyway, and Scattered Spider have also been seen tampering with cloud logs (e.g. filtering risky AWS CloudTrail logs, but not disabling it entirely so as not to raise suspicion).\nTargeting VMware environments for ransomware deployment. They do this by adding their compromised user account to the VMware admins group in VCentre (if needed — they are going after accounts with top tier privileges by default). From here, they can access the VMware environment via the ESXi hypervisor layer, where security software is nonexistent — thereby bypassing EDR and other typical endpoint and host based controls you rely on to prevent ransomware execution.\nThe key theme? Getting around your established security controls.\nConclusion\nYou can think of Scattered Spider as a kind of \"post-MFA\" threat actor that does everything they can to evade established security controls. By targeting identities and account takeovers, they bypass endpoint and network surfaces as much as possible, until the very end of the attack chain — by which point it's almost too late to be relying on those controls.\nSo, don't over-index on help desk scams — you need to consider your broader identity attack surface and various intrusion methods, from apps and accounts with MFA gaps, local accounts giving attackers a backdoor into accounts otherwise accessed with SSO, and MFA-bypassing AiTM phishing kits that are the new normal for phishing attacks.\nDefend your organization from Scattered Spider TTPs (not just help desk scams)\nTo learn more about Scattered Spider's identity-first toolkit, which is increasingly being adopted as standard by threat groups,\ncheck out the latest webinar from Push Security — now available on-demand!\nLearn how Push Security stops identity attacks\nPush Security provides comprehensive identity attack detection and response capabilities against techniques like AiTM phishing, credential stuffing, password spraying and session hijacking using stolen session tokens.

The malware comes fitted with capabilities to launch overlay attacks against a list of financial apps retrieved from an external server to harvest credentials.\nIt also abuses accessibility services permissions to capture seed phrases associated with cryptocurrency wallets, which can then be used to drain virtual assets stored in them.\nThe latest findings from ThreatFabric demonstrate an expansion of the malware's geographic scope as well as ongoing development with enhancements and new features, indicating that it's being actively maintained by the operators.\nSelect campaigns aimed at Poland have been found to leverage bogus ads on Facebook as a distribution vector by mimicking banks and e-commerce platforms. These ads lure victims to download an app to claim supposed bonus points. Users who attempt to download the app are directed to a malicious site that delivers the Crocodilus dropper.\nOther attack waves targeting Spanish and Turkish users have disguised themselves as a web browser update and an online casino. Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, and the United States are among the other nations that have been singled out by the malware.\nIn addition to incorporating various obfuscation techniques to complicate reverse engineering efforts, new variants of Crocodilus have the ability to add a specified contact to the victim's contact list upon receiving the command \"TRU9MMRHBCRO.\"\nIt's suspected that the feature is designed as a countermeasure to\nnew security protections\nthat Google has introduced in Android that alerts users of possible scams when launching banking apps during a screen-sharing session with an unknown contact.\n\"We believe the intent is to add a phone number under a convincing name such as 'Bank Support,' allowing the attacker to call the victim while appearing legitimate. This could also bypass fraud prevention measures that flag unknown numbers,\" ThreatFabric said.\nAnother new feature is an automated seed phrase collector that makes use of a parser to extract seed phrases and private keys of specific cryptocurrency wallets.\n\"The latest campaigns involving the Crocodilus Android banking Trojan signal a concerning evolution in both the malware's technical sophistication and its operational scope,\" the company said. \"Notably, its campaigns are no longer regionally confined; the malware has extended its reach to new geographical areas, underscoring its transition into a truly global threat.\"\nFound this article interesting?

It is used for code signing, compiling builds, app store uploading, notification delivery, and metadata management.\nThe 'fastlane-plugin-telegram' is a legitimate plugin that allows Fastlane to send notifications over Telegram using a Telegram bot that posts on a specified channel.\nThis is helpful for developers who need real-time updates on CI/CD pipelines inside their Telegram workspace, allowing them to keep track of key events without having to check dashboards.\nMalicious result appears when searching for Fastlane on RubyGems\nSource: Socket\nThe malicious gems discovered by Socket are nearly identical to the legitimate plugin, featuring the same public API, readme file, documentation, and core functionality.\nThe only difference, albeit a crucial one, is swapping out the legitimate Telegram API endpoint (https://api.telegram.org/) with the attacker's proxy-controlled endpoint (rough-breeze-0c37[.]buidanhnam95[.]workers[.]dev), so that sensitive information is intercepted (and very likely collected).\nFrom the project description\nSource: Socket\nStolen data includes the bot token, the message data, any uploaded files, and proxy credentials if configured.\nThe attacker has ample opportunity for exploitation and persistence because Telegram bot tokens remain valid until manually revoked by the victim.\nSocket notes that the gems' landing pages mention that the proxy \"does not store or modify your bot tokens,\" however, there's no way to verify this claim.\n\"Cloudflare Worker scripts are not publicly visible, and the threat actor retains full ability to log, inspect, or alter any data in transit,\"\nexplains Socket\n.\n\"The use of this proxy, combined with the typosquatting of a trusted Fastlane plugin, clearly indicates intent to exfiltrate tokens and message data under the guise of normal CI behavior.\"\n\"Moreover, the threat actor has not published the Worker's source code, leaving its implementation entirely opaque.\"\nDevelopers who have installed the two malicious gems should remove them immediately and rebuild any mobile binaries produced after the installation date. Also, all bot tokens used with Fastlane should be rotated as they have been compromised.\nSocket also suggests blocking traffic to '*.workers[.]dev' unless explicitly needed.\nWhy IT teams are ditching manual patch management\nManual patching is outdated.

        "Summary": "Scattered Spider isn't one group — it's an identity-first threat model evolving fast. From vishing to AiTM phishing, they're exploiting MFA gaps to hijack the cloud. Watch the Push Security webinar to learn how their identity-based tactics work — and how to stop them. [...]",
        "Date": "2025-06-03",
        "Content": "With the recent attacks on UK retailers Marks & Spencer and Co-op, so-called Scattered Spider has been all over the media, with coverage spilling over into the mainstream news due to the severity of the disruption — currently looking like hundreds of millions in lost profits for M&S alone.\nThis coverage is extremely valuable for the cyber security community as it raises awareness of the battles that security teams are fighting every day. But it’s also created a lot of noise that can make it tricky to understand the big picture.\nSo here’s three things that you might have missed — some you probably know already, and others that you might not be aware of if you haven’t been tracking Scattered Spider beyond the recent attacks.\n1. There’s no such thing as Scattered Spider\nAs a community, we sometimes forget that giving cool names to patterns of threat actor activity can sensationalize and make supervillains out of criminals. That said, cool names are sticky, and have a better chance of being commonly recognized and adopted, which is helpful for intelligence sharing.\nBut we need to remember that Scattered Spider didn’t call themselves Scattered Spider. CrowdStrike did. And there are lots of other names given to the pattern of activity and techniques that we know as Scattered Spider:\nUNC3944 (Mandiant)\nOcto Tempest (Microsoft)\n0ktapus (Group-IB)\nMuddled Libra (Unit 42)\nScatter Swine (Okta)\nBut it’s not quite as simple as that, because there aren’t clear boundaries. The pattern of activity that analysts classify as Scattered Spider touches on a number of self-named criminal groups like,\nLapsus$, Yanluowang, Karakurt\n, and\nShinyHunters\n(behind the Snowflake attacks in 2024).\nTypically, the main “brands” created by attackers overlap with ransomware/extortion crews, which often have their own unique (or at least modified) ransomware encryptor and platform.\nThis explains the other cool name that’s cropped up a lot in the recent reporting — DragonForce  — creating some confusion around specifically who executed the attacks on M&S and Co-op. Unlike Scattered Spider, DragonForce is a Ransomware-as-a-Service group that provides tooling and specialist services for hire to affiliates like Scattered Spider.\nThey are not the ones executing the attack, but the criminals classified under “Scattered Spider” are effectively using their services and encryption software once they have completed the initial intrusion.\nWhat defines Scattered Spider?\nSo, it’s confusing, but what we’re really tracking is patterns of behavior tied to certain regions of operation.\nWhen you think of Scattered Spider, you might be reminded of the series of arrests that happened throughout 2024. And yet, attacks have continued — because we’re not talking about a tight-knit group of specific individuals, but a broader community or collective of criminals, all using similar techniques, with the same ultimate goal — making money (typically through data theft, ransomware, and extortion).\nSo, what defines so-called Scattered Spider?\nPrimarily English native speakers located mainly in English-speaking countries — the UK, US, Canada, Australia — but with activity also traced to mainland Europe, Russia, and India.\nScattered Spider presence\nSource:\nMandiant\nUse of predominantly identity-based tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) specialising in phishing, credential attacks, help desk scams/vishing, SIM swapping, smishing, etc. — all designed to achieve account takeover.\nCloud-conscious techniques, such as targeting modern cloud identity provider accounts such as Okta and Microsoft Entra, and abusing cloud services and environments.\nWhen we think of Scattered Spider, we think of the quintessential cloud-native attacker who has grown up in the modern era of computing and internet services where being a hacker is less about network exploits than it is about logging into accounts on apps and services. These are people who probably cut their teeth in credit card scams and other forms of internet fraud rather than trawling the internet for exposed servers and open ports.\nSo they’re identity-first, but more important than that, they’re flexible and adaptable. They’re also willing to go after any and every company that presents an opportunity.\nLearn about Scattered Spider’s evolving TTPs and how to defend your organization\nScattered Spider has dominated the news in recent weeks following high-profile breaches impacting UK retailers. But with a long history of high-profile ransomware attacks, this is just one example of their identity-based approach.\nJoin Push Security as they go beyond the breaches and learn how to defend your organization against Scattered Spider’s growing arsenal of TTPs.\nWatch the webinar on-demand\n2. Help desk scams aren’t new\nThe headline story from the recent campaign against UK retailers is the use of help desk scams. This typically involves the attacker calling up a company’s help desk with some level of information — at minimum, PII that allows them to impersonate their victim, and sometimes a password, leaning heavily on their native English-speaking abilities to trick the help desk operator into giving them access to a user account.\nHow it works\nThe goal of a help desk scam is to get the help desk operator to reset the credentials and/or MFA used to access an account so the attacker can take control of it. They’ll use a variety of backstories and tactics to get that done, but most of the time it’s as simple as saying “I’ve got a new phone, can you remove my existing MFA and allow me to enroll a new one?”\nFrom there, the attacker is then sent an MFA reset link via email or SMS. Usually, this would be sent to, for example, a number on file — but at this point, the attacker has already established trust and bypassed the help desk process to a degree. So asking “can you send it to this email address” or “I’ve actually got a new number too, can you send it to…” gets this sent directly to the attacker.\nAt this point, it’s simply a case of using the self service password reset functionality for Okta or Entra (which you can get around because you now have the MFA factor to verify yourself) and voila, the attacker has taken control of the account.\nAnd the best part? Most help desks have the same process for every account — it doesn’t matter who you’re impersonating or which account you’re trying to reset. So, attackers are specifically targeting accounts likely to have top tier admin privileges — meaning once they get in, progressing the attack is trivial and much of the typical privilege escalation and lateral movement is removed from the attack path.\nSo, help desk scams have proved to be a reliable way of bypassing MFA and achieving account takeover — the foothold from which to launch the rest of an attack, such as stealing data, deploying ransomware, etc.\nThis isn’t their first rodeo\nBut something that’s not quite coming across in the reporting is that Scattered Spider have been doing this successfully since 2022, with the M&S and Co-op attacks merely the tip of the iceberg. Vishing (calling a user to get them to give up their MFA code) has been a part of their toolkit since the beginning, with the early attacks on Twilio, LastPass, Riot Games, and Coinbase involving some form of voice-based social engineering.\nNotably, the high-profile attacks on Caesars, MGM Resorts, and Transport for London all involved calling a help desk to reset credentials as the initial access vector.\nCaesars\nin August 2023 where hackers impersonated an IT user and convinced an outsourced help desk to reset credentials, after which the attacker stole the customer loyalty program database and secured a $15m ransom payment.\nMGM Resorts\nin September 2023, where the hacker used LinkedIn information to impersonate an employee and reset the employee’s credentials, resulting in a 6TB data theft. After MGM refused to pay, the attack eventually resulted in a 36-hour outage, a $100m hit, and a class-action lawsuit settled for $45m.\nTransport for London\nin September 2024 resulted in 5,000 users’ bank details exposed, 30,000 staff required to attend in-person appointments to verify their identities and reset passwords, and significant disruption to online services lasting for months.\nSo not only have Scattered Spider been using these techniques for some time, but the severity and impact of these attacks has been ramping up.\nAvoiding help desk gotchas\nThere’s lots of advice for securing help desks being circulated, but much of the advice still results in a process that is either phishable or difficult to implement.\nUltimately, organizations need to be prepared to introduce friction to their help desk process and either delay or deny requests in situations where there’s significant risk. So, for example, having a process for MFA reset that recognizes the risk associated with resetting a high-privileged account:\nRequire multi-party approval / escalation for admin-level account resets\nRequire in-person verification if the process can’t be followed remotely\nFreeze self-service resets when suspicious behavior is encountered (this would require some kind of internal process and awareness training to raise the alarm if an attack is suspected)\nAnd watch out for these gotchas:\nIf you receive a call, good practice is to terminate the call and dial the number on file for the employee. But, in a world of SIM swapping, this isn’t a foolproof solution — you could just be re-dialing the attacker.\nIf your solution is to get the employee on camera, increasingly sophisticated deepfakes can thwart this approach.\nBut, help desks are a target for a reason. They’re “helpful” by nature. This is usually reflected in how they’re operated and performance measured — delays won’t help you to hit those SLAs! Ultimately, a process only works if employees are willing to adhere to it — and can’t be socially engineered to break it.\nHelp desks that are removed from day-to-day operations (especially when outsourced or offshored) are also inherently susceptible to attacks where employees are impersonated.\nBut, the attacks we’re experiencing at the moment should give security stakeholders plenty of ammunition as to why help desk reforms are vital to securing the business (and what can happen if you don’t make changes).\n3. Scattered Spider don’t just do help desk scams\nAll that said, there’s a bigger picture here — help desk scams aren’t the only tool in the Scattered Spider toolkit.\nThey’ve consistently used a range of techniques, with a particular affinity for SIM swapping, smishing, and even basic credential phishing (usually targeted at Okta accounts).\nAnd this year, security researchers have observed Scattered Spider increasingly using Attacker-in-the-Middle (AiTM) phishing toolkits to bypass MFA.\nScattered Spider phishing pages running Evilginx\nSource: Researchers at\nSilentPush\nThis is very much on-brand for Scattered Spider. They exclusively use identity-based methods for their initial intrusions, all of which are designed to bypass MFA and achieve account takeover.\nTheir attacks are usually very direct. Scattered Spider tend to go straight for accounts that have elevated permissions, enabling them to quickly progress their attack.\nFor example, in the 2023 MGM attack, the attacker directly accessed an account with Super Admin permissions in Okta, which they combined with an\ninbound federation\nattack to impersonate any user in the tenant, get Azure admin privileges, and authenticate to the Azure-hosted VMware environment where they deployed ransomware.\nThey’ve also demonstrated that they are specifically targeting VMware servers as their target for ransomware deployment/encryption, noted in the MGM and M&S attacks. By targeting the VMware hypervisor (usually by adding their compromised identity to the Admins group in VCentre), they’re able to consciously evade endpoint-level controls running on the virtual machines themselves, such as EDR.\nParticularly if we consider the bigger picture with adjacent groups like ShinyHunters, who were behind the\nSnowflake attacks in 2024\n, and the severity of their attacks, we can see similar goals but different ways of achieving those goals.\nThe Snowflake attacks leveraged stolen credentials from prior infostealer infections dating back to 2021 to log into accounts without MFA (with widespread MFA gaps a big problem due to the nature of Snowflake identity management at the time), resulting in hundreds of millions of breached records across 165 victims.\nYou can also look at\ngroups like Lapsus$\n, who’ve demonstrated strikingly similar techniques in the past too.\nSo in summary, Scattered Spider uses a range of identity-based techniques to take over privileged accounts for their initial intrusion, all of which are designed to bypass MFA. They aren’t wedded to any specific technique though, and will use whatever means necessary within that identity-based framework to get the job done.\nConclusion\nYou can think of Scattered Spider as a kind of “post-MFA” threat actor that does everything they can to evade established security controls.\nBy targeting identities and account takeovers, they bypass endpoint and network surfaces as much as possible, until the very end of the attack chain — by which point it’s almost too late to be relying on those controls.\nSo, don’t over-index on help desk scams — you need to consider your broader identity attack surface and various intrusion methods, from apps and accounts with MFA gaps, local accounts giving attackers a backdoor into accounts otherwise accessed with SSO, and MFA-bypassing AiTM phishing kits that are the new normal for phishing attacks.\nWant to know more about Scattered Spider?\nWatch this on-demand webinar from researchers at Push Security\nto learn more about Scattered Spider’s TTP evolution and what you can do to defend your organization.\nLearn how Push Security stops identity attacks\nPush Security provides comprehensive identity attack detection and response capabilities against techniques like AiTM phishing, credential stuffing, password spraying and session hijacking using stolen session tokens.

Doing so would cause the device to display the name listed in a caller's contact profile rather than the caller ID when receiving an incoming call.\nThis could allow the threat actors to impersonate trusted banks, companies, or even friends and family members, making the calls appear more trustworthy.\nThis action is performed upon issuing a specific command that triggers the following code to programmatically (using ContentProvider API) create a new local contact on the Android device.\nJS snippet to create a new contact on the device\nSource: Threat Fabric\n\"Upon receiving the command \"TRU9MMRHBCRO\", Crocodilus adds a specified contact to the victim's contact list,\" explains Threat Fabric in the report.\n\"This further increases the attacker's control over the device. We believe the intent is to add a phone number under a convincing name such as \"Bank Support,\" allowing the attacker to call the victim while appearing legitimate.\"\nThe rogue contact is not tied to the user's Google account, so it won't sync with other devices where they're logged in.\nCrocodilus is evolving quickly, demonstrating an affinity to social engineering, which makes it a particularly dangerous malware.\nAndroid users are advised to stick to Google Play or trusted publishers when downloading software for their devices, ensuring that Play Protect is always active and minimizing the number of apps they use to the absolute necessary.\nWhy IT teams are ditching manual patch management\nManual patching is outdated.

This internal system is vital for services such as prepaid SIM registration for both Indonesian citizens (WNI) and foreign nationals (WNA), IMEI and voucher checks, and mobile top-ups. The sheer volume of data handled by this platform is concerning, with claims of over 920,000 transactions processed in just a 10-day period, and an estimated 220+ million transactions potentially recorded over five years.\nThe data allegedly exposed through this access is extensive, encompassing a wide array of sensitive customer and operational information.
