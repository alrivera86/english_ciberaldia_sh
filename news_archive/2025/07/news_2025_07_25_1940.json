        "Content": "The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned a North Korean front company and three associated individuals for their involvement in the fraudulent remote\ninformation technology (IT) worker scheme\ndesigned to generate illicit revenues for Pyongyang.\nThe sanctions target Korea Sobaeksu Trading Company (aka Sobaeksu United Corporation), and Kim Se Un, Jo Kyong Hun, and Myong Chol Min for evading sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the United Nations against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) government.\n\"Our commitment is clear: Treasury, as part of a whole-of-government effort, will continue to hold accountable those who seek to infiltrate global supply chains and enable the sanctions evasion activities that further the Kim regime's destabilizing agenda,\"\nsaid\nDirector of OFAC Bradley T. Smith.\nThe latest action marks the U.S. government's\ncontinued efforts\nto dismantle North Korea's wide-ranging revenue generation schemes and fund its illegal nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nThe IT worker scheme, which has mutated into a global threat, entails the DPRK regime dispatching highly skilled IT workers to various locations, including China, Russia, and Vietnam, to obtain remote jobs and infiltrate U.S. companies and elsewhere using a combination of fraudulent documents, stolen identities, and false personas, often with help from facilitators who run laptop farms.\nIn what has been described as a recurring, if \"baffling,\" theme, many of these fake workers have been\nfound\nto use Minions and other Despicable Me characters in social-media profiles and email addresses.\n\"The DPRK government withholds most of the wages earned by IT workers, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to support the North Korean regime's unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs,\" the Treasury said. \"In some cases, these DPRK IT workers have introduced malware into company networks to exfiltrate proprietary and sensitive data.\"\nThe development comes merely weeks after OFAC\nsanctioned\nSong Kum Hyok, a 38-year-old member of a North Korean hacking group called Andariel, for their role in the IT worker scheme.\nIn related news, Christina Marie Chapman, 50, of Arizona, was sentenced to 8.5 years in prison for running a laptop farm for IT workers to give the impression that they were working remotely within the U.S. when, in reality, they were logging into those machines remotely. Chapman\npleaded guilty\nearlier this February.\nThe impacted companies included a top-five major television network, a Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace manufacturer, an American car maker, a luxury retail store, and a U.S. media and entertainment company. The IT workers also unsuccessfully attempted to land jobs at two different U.S. government agencies.\nThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seized more than 90 laptops from Chapman's home during an October 2023 raid. Chapman is also said to have 49 laptops at locations overseas, including multiple shipments to a Chinese city on the North Korean border.\nIn all, the elaborate counterfeit operation netted more than $17 million in illicit revenue for Chapman and North Korea from October 2020 to October 2023. Chapman has also been ordered to serve three years of supervised release, to forfeit $284,556 that was to be paid to the North Koreans, and to pay a judgment of $176,850.\n\"Christina Chapman perpetrated a years' long scheme that resulted in millions of dollars raised for the DPRK regime, exploited more than 300 American companies and government agencies, and stole dozens of identities of American citizens,\"\nsaid\nActing Assistant Attorney General Matthew R.

Known to be active since at least 2009, the hacking group has a\ntrack record\nof striking entities in China, Pakistan, and other countries in South Asia.\nExactly a year ago, the Knownsec 404 Team\ndocumented\nPatchwork's targeting entities with ties to Bhutan to deliver the Brute Ratel C4 framework and an updated version of a backdoor called PGoShell.\nSince the start of 2025, the threat actor has been linked to various campaigns\naimed at Chinese universities\n, with recent attacks\nusing baits\nrelated to power grids in the country to deliver a Rust-based loader that, in turn, decrypts and launches a C# trojan called Protego to harvest a wide range of information from compromised Windows systems.\nAnother report published by Chinese cybersecurity firm QiAnXin back in May\nsaid\nit identified infrastructure overlaps between Patchwork and\nDoNot Team\n(aka APT-Q-38 or Bellyworm), suggesting potential operational connections between the two threat clusters.\nThe targeting of Türkiye by the hacking group points to an expansion of its targeting footprint, using malicious Windows shortcut (LNK) files distributed via phishing emails as a starting point to kick-off the multi-stage infection process.\nSpecifically, the LNK file is designed to invoke PowerShell commands that are responsible for fetching additional payloads from an external server (\"expouav[.]org\"), a domain created on June 25, 2025, that hosts a PDF lure mimicking an international conference on unmanned vehicle systems, details of which are hosted on the legitimate waset[.]org website.\n\"The PDF document serves as a visual decoy, designed to distract the user while the rest of the execution chain runs silently in the background,\" Arctic Wolf said. \"This targeting occurs as Türkiye commands 65% of the global UAV export market and develops critical hypersonic missile capabilities, while simultaneously strengthening defense ties with Pakistan during a period of heightened India-Pakistan tensions.\"\nAmong the downloaded artifacts is a malicious DLL that's launched using DLL side-loading by means of a scheduled task, ultimately leading to the execution of shellcode that carries out extensive reconnaissance of the compromised host, including taking screenshots, and exfiltrating the details back to the server.\n\"This represents a significant evolution of this threat actor's capabilities, transitioning from the x64 DLL variants observed in November 2024, to the current x86 PE executables with enhanced command structures,\" the company said. \"Dropping Elephant demonstrates continued operational investment and development through architectural diversification from x64 DLL to x86 PE formats, and enhanced C2 protocol implementation through impersonation of legitimate websites.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The bogus sites have since been taken down by Google.\nWiz posited that the campaign, which has been previously observed going after\nApache Tomcat services\nwith weak credentials, as well as susceptible\nApache Struts and Atlassian Confluence servers\nusing the\nSysrv\nbotnet, is part of a broader crypto-scam infrastructure, including fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platforms.\nThe latest campaign has also been found to target publicly-accessible PostgreSQL instances, with the attackers also abusing compromised Apache Tomcat servers to host payloads tailored for both Linux and Windows environments. Also hacked by the attackers is a legitimate Korean transportation website for malware delivery.\nOnce initial access is obtained, PostgreSQL's\nCOPY ... FROM PROGRAM SQL command\nis\nexploited\nto run arbitrary shell commands on the host and achieve remote code execution.\n\"The attacker behind Soco404 appears to be conducting automated scans for exposed services, aiming to exploit any accessible entry point,\" Wiz said. \"Their use of a wide range of ingress tools, including Linux utilities like wget and curl, as well as Windows-native tools such as certutil and PowerShell, highlights an opportunistic strategy.\"\nOn Linux systems, a dropper shell script is executed directly in memory to download and launch a next-stage payload, while simultaneously taking steps to terminate competing miners to maximize financial gain and limit forensic visibility by overwriting logs associated with cron and wtmp.\nThe payload executed in the next-stage is a binary that serves as a loader for the miner by contacting an external domain (\"www.fastsoco[.]top\") that's based on Google Sites.\nThe attack chain for Windows leverages the initial post-exploitation command to download and execute a Windows binary, which, like its Linux counterpart, functions akin to a loader that embeds both the miner and the\nWinRing0.sys driver\n, the latter being used to obtain NT\\SYSTEM privileges.\nOn top of that, the malware attempts to stop the Windows event log service and executes a self-deletion command to evade detection.\n\"Rather than relying on a single method or operating system, the attacker casts a wide net, deploying whichever tool or technique is available in the environment to deliver their payload,\" the company said. \"This flexible approach is characteristic of a broad, automated cryptomining campaign focused on maximizing reach and persistence across varied targets.\"\nThe discovery of Soco404 dovetails with the emergence of a new Linux threat dubbed Koske that's suspected to be developed with assistance from a large language model (LLM) and uses seemingly innocuous images of pandas to propagate the malware.\nThe attack starts with the exploitation of a misconfigured server, such as\nJupyterLab\n, to install various scripts from two JPEG images, including a C-based rootkit that's used to hide malicious malware-related files using\nLD_PRELOAD\nand a shell script that ultimately downloads cryptocurrency miners on the infected system. Both payloads are directly executed in memory to avoid leaving traces on disk.\nKoske's end goal is to deploy CPU and GPU-optimized cryptocurrency miners that take advantage of the host's computational resources to mine 18 distinct coins, such as Monero, Ravencoin, Zano, Nexa, and Tari, among others.\n\"These images are polyglot files, with malicious payloads appended to the end. Once downloaded, the malware extracts and executes the malicious segments in memory, bypassing antivirus tools,\" Aqua researcher Assaf Morag\nsaid\n.\n\"This technique isn't steganography but rather polyglot file abuse or malicious file embedding. This technique uses a valid JPG file with malicious shellcode hidden at the end. Only the last bytes are downloaded and executed, making it a sneaky form of polyglot abuse.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A recent analysis of enterprise data suggests that generative AI tools developed in China are being used extensively by employees in the US and UK, often without oversight or approval from security teams. The study, conducted by Harmonic Security, also identifies hundreds of instances in which sensitive data was uploaded to platforms hosted in China, raising concerns over compliance, data residency, and commercial confidentiality.\nOver a 30-day period, Harmonic examined the activity of a sample of 14,000 employees across a range of companies. Nearly 8 percent were found to have used China-based GenAI tools, including DeepSeek, Kimi Moonshot, Baidu Chat, Qwen (from Alibaba), and Manus. These applications, while powerful and easy to access, typically provide little information on how uploaded data is handled, stored, or reused.\nThe findings underline a widening gap between AI adoption and governance, especially in developer-heavy organizations where time-to-output often trumps policy compliance.\nIf you're looking for a way to enforce your AI usage policy with granular controls, contact\nHarmonic Security\n.\nData Leakage at Scale\nIn total, over 17 megabytes of content were uploaded to these platforms by 1,059 users. Harmonic identified 535 separate incidents involving sensitive information. Nearly one-third of that material consisted of source code or engineering documentation. The remainder included documents related to mergers and acquisitions, financial reports, personally identifiable information, legal contracts, and customer records.\nHarmonic's study singled out DeepSeek as the most prevalent tool, associated with 85 percent of recorded incidents. Kimi Moonshot and Qwen are also seeing uptake. Collectively, these services are reshaping how GenAI appears inside corporate networks. It's not through sanctioned platforms, but through quiet, user-led adoption.\nChinese GenAI services frequently operate under permissive or opaque data policies. In some cases, platform terms allow uploaded content to be used for further model training. The implications are substantial for firms operating in regulated sectors or handling proprietary software and internal business plans.\nPolicy Enforcement Through Technical Controls\nHarmonic Security has developed tools to help enterprises regain control over how GenAI is used in the workplace. Its platform monitors AI activity in real time and enforces policy at the moment of use.\nCompanies have granular controls to block access to certain applications based on their HQ location, restrict specific types of data from being uploaded, and educate users through contextual prompts.\nGovernance as a Strategic Imperative\nThe rise of unauthorized GenAI use inside enterprises is no longer hypothetical. Harmonic's data show that nearly one in twelve employees is already interacting with Chinese GenAI platforms, often with no awareness of data retention risks or jurisdictional exposure.\nThe findings suggest that awareness alone is insufficient. Firms will require active, enforced controls if they are to enable GenAI adoption without compromising compliance or security. As the technology matures, the ability to govern its use may prove just as consequential as the performance of the models themselves.\nHarmonic makes it possible to embrace the benefits of GenAI without exposing your business to unnecessary risk.\nLearn more about how Harmonic helps enforce AI policies and protect sensitive data at\nharmonic.security\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nGoogle News\n,\nTwitter\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "Article written by cybersecurity expert Yuriy Tsibere.\nGone are the days when cybersecurity meant stopping annoying viruses like the Love Bug. Today, it’s about battling a massive, financially motivated cybercrime industry. Attacks are smarter, faster, and more damaging—and that changes everything for product teams.\nFor product managers (PMs), this means understanding that attackers are constantly exploiting the same weak spots: stolen admin credentials, missing multi-factor authentication (MFA) on VPNs, remote encryption, and clever “living off the land” (LOTL) tricks like using Office to launch PowerShell.\nEven something as simple as an unpatched firewall or a rogue USB drive can open the door to a breach.\nNew vulnerabilities and zero-days are popping up all the time, and product teams have to stay on their toes. A few examples:\nWannaCry (2017):\nUsed the EternalBlue flaw in SMBv1 to spread ransomware fast. It forced companies to disable SMBv1 altogether.\nSome Exchange Server bugs\n:\nLet attackers run malicious scripts, sometimes leading to ransomware.\nLog4j vulnerability:\nA vulnerability in a popular Java logging framework that enables arbitrary code execution. Still showing up in outdated firewalls and VPNs.\nFollina (MSDT):\nLet Office apps launch PowerShell without any user interaction.\nTimely patching helps, but it’s not enough. There’s always a gap between discovering a flaw and fixing it. That’s why teams need layered defenses and a mindset that’s ready to respond to incidents as they happen.\nHow breach reports drive real-time product shifts\nThe\n100 days to secure your environment\nwebinar series from ThreatLocker\nis a great example of incident-driven development. It helps security leaders focus on what matters most in their first few months.\nReal-world breaches often directly lead to new product features or policy changes. Here’s how:\nUnlocked machines:\na threat actor\nonce accessed a hospital computer that was left open and ran PowerShell. Now, password-protected screen savers are a must.\nUSB data theft:\nUSB drives are still a go-to for stealing data. Products now offer fine-grained USB controls—blocking unencrypted drives, limiting file types, or capping how many files can be copied.\nLateral movement:\nRansomware often spreads using old admin accounts. Tools now detect and remove these after review.\nLOTL attacks:\nFollina showed how legit tools can be misused.\nRingfencing™ helps stop apps\nfrom launching things they shouldn’t.\nOutbound traffic abuse:\nAttacks like SolarWinds used outbound connections. Now, default-deny policies for server traffic are becoming standard.\nStolen credentials:\nMFA is non-negotiable for cloud accounts, remote access, and domain controllers.\nVulnerable VPNs:\nUnpatched VPNs are a big risk. Features now include IP-based access controls or even disabling unused VPNs.\nThe PM's response: From advisory to actionable feature\nFor cybersecurity PMs, reacting to threats means more than just writing advisories. It’s about building smarter, safer products. Here’s how:\nGet full visibility\nStart by understanding what’s running in your environment. Use monitoring agents to track file activity, privilege changes, app launches, and network traffic.\nPrioritize risks\nWith a complete picture, PMs can focus on high-risk tools and behaviors:\nRemote access tools like TeamViewer or AnyDesk\nSoftware with too many permissions (e.g., 7-Zip, Nmap)\nRisky browser extensions\nSoftware from high-risk regions\nDrive adaptive policy creation\nSecurity policies should evolve with the threat landscape:\nTest first: Use monitor-only mode and test groups before enforcing new rules.\nBe precise: Go beyond on/off switches—use dynamic ACLs, Ringfencing, and app-specific admin rights.\nEncourage adoption by minimizing disruption\nOffer a store of pre-approved apps\nMake it easy to request new software\nExplain why restrictions exist—it builds trust\nContinuous improvement and monitoring:\nUse health reports to spot misconfigurations\nBlock USB file copies if thresholds are exceeded\nClean up old policies and unused apps regularly\nEmbrace patch management\nMake sure everything—from operating systems to portable applications like PuTTY—is up to date. Use tools to find missing patches and test them with pilot users before rolling out.\nProtect backups\nBackups must be shielded from compromise. This includes limiting which apps can access them and requiring MFA for backup services. PMs should also test the backups regularly to validate recovery readiness.\nCybersecurity PMs are on the front lines of using real-world protections against real-world threats.\nBy staying informed, collecting the right data, and building with users in mind, you can reduce risk without making life harder for your team.\nBook a demo today to learn how ThreatLocker Patch Management can help you with these tasks.\nSponsored and written by\nThreatLocker\n."

Overall increased international pressure is another effect of the sanctions.\nSanctions are not the only means to disrupt DPRK's efforts as the U.S. Department of State has announced rewards of\nup to $7 million\nfor information leading to the arrest/conviction of the sanctioned individuals.\nCloud Detection & Response for Dummies\nContain emerging threats in real time - before they impact your business.\nLearn how cloud detection and response (CDR) gives security teams the edge they need in this practical, no-nonsense guide.\nGet the Guide\nRelated Articles:\nTreasury sanctions North Korean over IT worker malware scheme\nUS disrupts North Korean IT worker \"laptop farm\" scheme in 16 states\nUS sanctions firm linked to cyber scams behind $200 million in losses\nWoman gets 8 years for aiding North Koreans infiltrate 300 US firms\nHackers fooled Cognizant help desk, says Clorox in $380M cyberattack lawsuit"

The group has posted a new entry on its data leak site claiming to have successfully breached Salamander Resort & Spa, a high-end vacation destination located in Middleburg, Virginia. Opened in 2013, the resort is a significant player in the local luxury tourism market, offering premium accommodations, a full-service spa, multiple restaurants, and various recreational activities, including equestrian experiences. With a reported income of over $50 million, a cyberattack on this establishment could have significant financial and reputational consequences.\nThe ransomware group’s post, dated July 24, 2025, alleges that they have encrypted the resort’s data. While specific details of the compromised information have not been publicly disclosed, ransomware attacks of this nature typically involve the exfiltration of sensitive customer and corporate data before encryption. The attackers then demand a ransom payment to restore access to the encrypted files and prevent the public release of the stolen information.\nThis incident highlights the growing trend of ransomware groups targeting organizations of all sizes and sectors, with the hospitality industry being a particularly attractive target due to the wealth of personal and financial data it handles. The investigation into the alleged breach at Salamander Resort & Spa is likely in its early stages, and it remains to be seen how the resort will respond to the situation and what the full impact of this cyberattack will be on its operations and clientele.\nTags:\nCyberSecurity\ndata-breach\nhospitality\nLynx ransomware\nransomware\nSalamander Resort & Spa\nUSA"
