        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a malicious campaign that leverages search engine optimization (\nSEO\n) poisoning techniques to deliver a known malware loader called\nOyster\n(aka Broomstick or CleanUpLoader).\nThe malvertising activity, per Arctic Wolf, promotes fake websites hosting trojanized versions of legitimate tools like PuTTY and WinSCP, aiming to trick software professionals searching for these programs into installing them instead.\n\"Upon execution, a backdoor known as Oyster/Broomstick is installed,\" the company\nsaid\nin a brief published last week.\n\"Persistence is established by creating a scheduled task that runs every three minutes, executing a malicious DLL (twain_96.dll) via rundll32.exe using the DllRegisterServer export, indicating the use of DLL registration as part of the persistence mechanism.\"\nThe names of some of the bogus websites are listed below -\nupdaterputty[.]com\nzephyrhype[.]com\nputty[.]run\nputty[.]bet, and\nputtyy[.]org\nIt's suspected that the threat actors behind the campaign may also be targeting other IT tools to deliver the malware, making it imperative that users stick to trusted sources and official vendor sites to download the necessary software.\nThe disclosure comes as black hat SEO poisoning techniques are being used to game search results associated with artificial intelligence (AI)-related keywords to spread\nVidar\n,\nLumma\n, and\nLegion Loader\n.\nThese websites come fitted with JavaScript code that checks for the presence of ad blockers and gathers information from the victim's browser, before initiating a redirection chain that ultimately takes the victim to a phishing page hosting a ZIP archive.\n\"The final download pages in this campaign deliver Vidar Stealer and Lumma Stealer as password-protected ZIP archives, with the password provided on the final downloading page,\" Zscaler ThreatLabz\nsaid\n. \"Once extracted, they contain an 800MB NSIS installer, a deceptively large size intended to appear legitimate and bypass detection systems with file size limitations.\"\nThe NSIS installer is then used to execute an AutoIt script that's ultimately responsible for launching the stealer payloads. The delivery mechanism for Legion Loader, in contrast, leverages an MSI installer to deploy the malware via a batch script.\nA similar SEO poisoning campaign has been\nobserved\nto elevate phishing pages when users search for the names of popular web applications to direct users to fake Cloudflare CAPTCHA check pages that make use of the infamous\nClickFix\nstrategy to drop\nRedLine Stealer\nvia\nHijack Loader\n.\nAccording to data compiled by Kaspersky, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are being increasingly targeted by cyber attacks that deliver malware disguised as popular AI and collaboration tools like OpenAI ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Cisco AnyConnect, Google Drive, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\"Between January and April 2025 alone, around 8,500 small and medium-sized business users were targeted by cyberattacks in which malware or potentially unwanted software was disguised as these popular tools,\" the Russian cybersecurity company\nsaid\n.\nZoom accounted for about 41% of the total number of unique files, followed by Outlook and PowerPoint at 16% each, Excel at 12%, Word at 9%, and Teams at 5%. The number of unique malicious files mimicking ChatGPT increased by 115% to 177 in the first four months of 2025.\nWhile the trend of abusing fake search engine listings to take advantage of users' implicit in popular brands is a well-known tactic, recent campaigns have hijacked searches for tech support pages linked to Apple, Bank of America, Facebook, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal to serve legitimate pages through sponsored results in Google – but with an ingenious twist.\n\"Visitors are taken to the help/support section of the brand's website, but instead of the genuine phone number, the hijackers display their scammy number instead,\" Malwarebytes\nsaid\n.\nThis is achieved by means of a technique called search parameter injection to show within a search bar a number that's under the attacker's control in order to give the impression that it's an official search result within the help center pages and deceive unsuspecting users into calling them.\nWhat makes the attack particularly insidious is that the parameters added to the right of the actual help center domain (e.g., \"Call us 1-***-***-**** for free\") are not visible in the sponsored search result, thereby giving no reason for users to suspect anything is amiss.\nIt's not just Google's advertising platform. Threat actors have also been caught serving fake ads on Facebook to phish for cryptocurrency wallet recovery phrases and spreading malware in conjunction with\nPi2Day\n, a yearly event linked to the Pi Network community.\nThe malware, spread via ads urging users to install a new version of the Pi Network desktop app for Windows, comes with capabilities to steal saved credentials and crypto wallet keys, log user input, and download additional payloads, all the while evading detection.\nRomanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender\nsaid\nthe activity is possibly the work of a single threat actor that's \"running parallel fraud schemes on Meta to maximize reach, financial gain, and targeting efficiency.\"\nIt doesn't end here, for phony websites impersonating AI, VPN services, and other well-known software brands have been found to deliver Poseidon Stealer on macOS systems and a loader dubbed PayDay Loader, which then acts as a conduit for Lumma Stealer on Windows machines. The activity has been codenamed Dark Partners by security researcher g0njxa.\nPayDay Loader relies on Google Calendar links as a dead drop resolver to extract the command-and-control (C2) server and obtain obfuscated JavaScript code engineered to load the Lumma Stealer payload and siphon sensitive data.\nInterestingly, the email address used to create the Google Calendar events (\"echeverridelfin@gmail[.]com\") was also spotted in connection with a malicious npm package called \"\nos-info-checker-es6\n.\" This indicates that the Dark Partners actors have likely experimented with different delivery mechanisms.\n\"The PayDay Loader has a Node.js stealer module to exfiltrate cryptocurrencies wallet data to an external C2,\" g0njxa\nsaid\n. \"Using the\nADM-ZIP library\nfor Node.js , the PayDay Loader is able to find, pack, and send wallet information to a hard-coded C2 host.\"\nThese campaigns go hand in hand with an\nongoing\nphenomenon\nwhere\nscammers\nand\ncybercriminals\nset up\nsprawling networks\ncomprising\nthousands of websites\nto spoof popular brands and commit financial fraud by advertising real products that are never delivered. One such network, dubbed GhostVendors by Silent Push, buys Facebook ads space to promote over 4,000 sketchy sites.\nThe malicious Facebook Marketplace ads are run for a few days, after which they are stopped, effectively deleting all traces of them from the Meta Ad Library. It's worth pointing out that Meta has only retained ads on social issues, elections, and politics for the past seven years.\n\"This helped to confirm a known Meta ad library policy existed, and highlighted that potentially these threat actors were taking advantage of this by rapidly launching and stopping ads for similar products on different pages,\" Silent Push researchers\nsaid\n.\nAnother network spotted by the company, targeting English and Spanish language shoppers with fake marketplace ads, is assessed to be the work of Chinese threat actors. These websites are mainly designed to steal credit card information entered on payment pages, while claiming to process the orders. Some of the bogus sites also include Google Pay purchase widgets to enable payments.\n\"This fake marketplace campaign primarily targets consumers with a phishing threat that exploits major brands, well-known organizations, and the fame of some political figures,\" Silent Push\nsaid\n.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Everything feels secure—until one small thing slips through. Even strong systems can break if a simple check is missed or a trusted tool is misused. Most threats don't start with alarms—they sneak in through the little things we overlook. A tiny bug, a reused password, a quiet connection—that's all it takes.\nStaying safe isn't just about reacting fast. It's about catching these early signs before they blow up into real problems. That's why this week's updates matter. From stealthy tactics to unexpected entry points, the stories ahead reveal how quickly risk can spread—and what smart teams are doing to stay ahead. Dive in.\n⚡ Threat of the Week\nU.S. Disrupts N. Korea IT Worker Scheme\n— Prosecutors said they uncovered the North Korean IT staff working at over 100 U.S. companies using fictitious or stolen identities and not only drawing salaries, but also stealing secret data and plundering virtual currency more than $900,000 in one incident targeting an unnamed blockchain company in Atlanta. The actions are the latest steps to stop the scheme, which has seen North Korea earn millions through thousands of people who use fake identities to get hired as IT workers at companies based in the West and other parts of the world. Authorities conducted 21 searches across 14 states last month, adding to searches that were conducted at eight locations in October 2024 spanning three states. In at least one case, North Korean IT workers gained access to \"sensitive employer data and source code, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) data,\" after they were hired by a California-based defense contractor that develops artificial intelligence-powered equipment and technologies, the Justice Department said. In all, the coordinated action led to the arrest of one individual, and the seizure of 21 web domains, 29 financial accounts used to launder tens of thousands of dollars, and nearly 200 laptops and remote access devices, including KVMs. The U.S. State Department is\noffering rewards\nof up to $5 million for information leading to the \"disruption of financial mechanisms of persons engaged in certain activities that support North Korea.\" The actions reveal that North Koreans didn't merely falsify IDs to insinuate themselves into Western tech firms, but also allegedly stole the identities of \"more than 80 U.S. persons\" to impersonate them in jobs at more than 100 U.S. companies and funnel money to the Kim regime.\nEmployees Are Using AI To Improve Their Work But Creating Risk\nVPNs and public-facing IPs are your attack surface. Zero Trust + AI ensures safe public AI productivity.\nLearn More ➝\n🔔 Top News\nChinese Threat Actor Targets French Orgs Using Ivanti Flaws\n— A China-linked intrusion set known as Houken targeted a number of entities spanning governmental, telecommunications, media, finance, and transport sectors in France in early September 2024 using three vulnerabilities in Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance (CSA) devices as zero-days. The attacks have been observed paving the way for PHP web shells, deploying a kernel rootkit, and even attempting to patch the vulnerabilities, likely to prevent exploitation by other unrelated actors. It's suspected that Houken is an initial access broker that obtains a foothold into target networks, and passes on that access to other threat actors for follow-on post-exploitation activities.\nNew Chrome 0-Day Exploited in the Wild\n— Google released security updates to address a type confusion flaw in its Chrome web browser that it said has been exploited in the wild. The exact nature of the attacks is presently not known, although it's believed to have been deployed as part of highly-targeted attacks due to the fact that it was discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), which specializes in detecting government-backed attacks. It has been patched in versions 138.0.7204.96/.97 for Windows, 138.0.7204.92/.93 for macOS, and 138.0.7204.96 for Linux.\nU.S. Sanctions Russian Bulletproof Hosting Provider Aeza\n— The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Russia-based bulletproof hosting (BPH) service provider Aeza Group for providing the infrastructure that enabled threat actors to deliver stealer malware and ransomware like BianLian, RedLine, Meduza, and Lumma, as well as host illicit drugs marketplace on the dark web. In addition, three of the company's subsidiaries and four main individuals linked to it have been sanctioned. This includes Aeza Group's CEO Arsenii Aleksandrovich Penzev, general director Yurii Meruzhanovich Bozoyan, technical director Vladimir Vyacheslavovich Gast, and Igor Anatolyevich Knyazev.\nNightEagle Targets Chinese AI and Military Sectors\n— A previously undocumented threat actor known as NightEagle has been observed leveraging a zero-day exploit chain in Microsoft Exchange to deliver the Go-based Chisel utility and steal mailbox data from compromised accounts. The group is also said to have targeted source code repositories and backup storage systems. The threat actor, believed to be active since 2023, has targeted high-tech, chip semiconductors, quantum technology, artificial intelligence, and military verticals in China, QiAnXin's RedDrip Team said. The disclosure comes close on the heels of another spear-phishing campaign dubbed\nDRAGONCLONE\nthat has singled out Chinese telecom companies to propagate VELETRIX and VShell. The phishing emails, per Seqrite Labs, contain a malicious ZIP archive that includes legitimate binaries and malicious DLL files, which, in turn, is executed using DLL side-loading to launch the VELETRIX loader. The malware is designed to load shellcode, an adversary simulation framework called VShell, directly in memory. The use of VShell is notable as it has been widely adopted by various Chinese hacking groups to target organizations in the West. Seqrite Labs said the activity shares behavioral similarities with\nEarth Lamia\nand\nUNC5174\n, indicating that the campaign is likely the work of a China-nexus group.\nNorth Korea Targets Crypto Businesses with Nim Malware\n— North Korean threat actors tracked as BlueNoroff are deploying novel techniques to infect crypto businesses with macOS malware designed to steal credentials from web browsers, iCloud Keychain data, and Telegram application information. The attacks impersonate a victim's trusted contact to invite them over Telegram and lure employees at Web3 and crypto-related organizations into installing Nim-compiled macOS malware via fake Zoom software updates under the pretext of setting up a meeting. The bogus updates are designed to run AppleScript payloads, which are then used to deliver two Mach-O binaries in order to set off two independent execution chains. One leads to the execution of scripts to harvest data, while the other, compiled from Nim source code, is used to set up persistence on the host. Together, the two components facilitate data exfiltration and persistence.\n‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs\nHackers are quick to jump on newly discovered software flaws—sometimes within hours. Whether it's a missed update or a hidden bug, even one unpatched CVE can open the door to serious damage. Below are this week's high-risk vulnerabilities making waves. Review the list, patch fast, and stay a step ahead.\nThis week's list includes —\nCVE-2025-32462, CVE-2025-32463\n(Sudo),\nCVE-2025-20309\n(Cisco Unified CM and Unified CM SME),\nCVE-2025-49596\n(Anthropic MCP Inspector),\nCVE-2025-6554\n(Google Chrome),\nCVE-2025-5622, CVE-2025-5623, CVE-2025-5624, CVE-2025-5630\n(D-Link DIR-816 routers),\nCVE-2025-49151, CVE-2025-49152, CVE-2025-49153\n(Microsens NMP Web+),\nCVE-2025-6463\n(Forminator plugin),\nCVE-2025-36630\n(Tenable Nessus),\nCVE-2025-52891\n(ModSecurity Web Application Firewall),\nCVE-2025-48927, CVE-2025-48928\n(\nTeleMessage TM SGNL\n),\nCVE-2024-58248\n(nopCommerce),\nCVE-2025-32897\n(Apache Seata),\nCVE-2025-47812\n(Wing FTP),\nCVE-2025-4404\n(FreeIPA),\nCVE-2025-5959, CVE-2025-6554, CVE-2025-6191, and CVE-2025-6192\n(Grafana),\nCVE-2025-34067\n(Hikvision Integrated Security Management Platform),\nCVE-2025-1735\n,\nCVE-2025-6491\n(PHP),\nCVE-2025-53367\n(DjVuLibre), and\nCVE-2025-49826\n(Next.js).\n📰 Around the Cyber World\nApple and Google App Stores Offer China-linked VPN Apps\n— Both Apple's and Google's online stores offer free virtual private network (VPN) apps that have undisclosed ties to Chinese companies, likely posing a privacy risk. Thirteen virtual private network (VPN) apps on Apple's App Store and 11 apps on Google's Play Store (seven common to both) have ties to Chinese companies, the Tech Transparency Project\nsaid\n. \"VPNs are of particular concern because anyone using a VPN has the entirety of their online activity routed through that application,\" Katie Paul, the TTP's director,\ntold\nNBC News. \"When it comes to Chinese-owned VPNs, that means this data can be turned over to the Chinese government based on China's state laws.\"\nScattered Spider Uses Teleport for Persistence\n— The notorious cybercrime group known as\nScattered Spider\nhas leveraged a novel persistence mechanism that involves the use of Teleport, an infrastructure access platform not previously associated with the threat actor. The findings demonstrate how bad actors are weaponizing legitimate administrative tools to maintain persistent access to compromised networks. \"After obtaining admin-level cloud access, the attacker installed a Teleport agent on compromised Amazon EC2 servers to establish a persistent remote command-and-control (C2) channel,\" Rapid7\nsaid\n. \"Teleport is a legitimate open-source tool for managing remote infrastructure, but here it was co-opted for malicious purposes. This effectively gave the attacker persistent remote shell access to those cloud servers even if their initial user credentials or VPN access were revoked. The use of Teleport indicates Scattered Spider's adaptability in using new tools for persistence and command-and-control. By using standard administrative software, they reduce the chance of detection by security tools that might flag custom malware.\"\nLinux Servers Targeted by Crypto Miners\n— Improperly secured Linux servers, especially weak SSH credentials, are being targeted by threat actors to drop cryptocurrency miners and rope them into DDoS botnets. The attacks also lead to the deployment of proxy tools like TinyProxy or Sing-box, as well as allow a threat actor to establish persistence on the hosts. \"Attackers can use the infected system as a proxy to conceal themselves in another attack case or sell access rights to the proxy node for criminal profit,\" AhnLab\nsaid\n. Another\nset of attacks\nhas singled out MySQL servers to deliver Gh0st RAT variants, and other payloads like AsyncRAT, Ddostf DDoS botnet, XWorm, HpLoader, and even the legitimate remote control tool Zoho ManageEngine. XWorm has emerged as one of the\nmost versatile and widely distributed\nremote access trojans in the current threat landscape, exhibiting remarkable adaptability in its delivery mechanisms and establishing itself as a formidable tool in cybercriminals' toolbox. Recent attacks mounted by a China-linked threat actor have employed trojanized MSI installers posing as WhatsApp to deliver the trojan in attacks targeting users in East and Southeast Asia. \"The attack chain involves encrypted shellcode embedded in image files, PowerShell scripts for persistence via scheduled tasks and shellcode loaders,\" Broadcom\nsaid\n. \"The final payload is a modified XWorm RAT enhanced with functions to detect Telegram installations and report infected systems via Telegram-based mechanisms.\"\nIran IRGC's Intelligence Group 13 Detailed\n— The DomainTools Investigations (DTI) team has shed light on a shadowy entity called Intelligence Group 13, a covert cyber strike unit that functions under Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to facilitate cyber espionage, industrial sabotage, and psychological warfare. Embedded within the Shahid Kaveh Cyber Group, Intelligence Group 13 powers Cyber Av3ngers, a pro-Iranian group that has been\nattributed\nto\nattacks\ntargeting water authorities and SCADA systems in Israel and the U.S. \"Whether through direct disruption, pre-positioned malware activation, or narrative defacement and psychological intimidation, the group's capabilities make it a prime tool for hybrid response, combining deniable technical aggression with symbolic messaging designed to project defiance and psychological impact,\" DTI\nsaid\n.\nOpen VSX Used to Distribute Malicious VS Code Extensions\n— Almost 200,000 developers have downloaded two malicious VSCode extensions from the Open VSX Registry. The extensions, both named Solidity Language, scan for existing ConnectWise ScreenConnect remote desktop software, and if present, download and install a malicious version from an attacker-controlled server. The extensions have since been removed from the marketplace. The findings once again illustrate that openness doesn't necessarily equate to safety. \"The very openness that makes Open VSX appealing also introduces risks that the more curated VS Code Marketplace helps mitigate,\" Secure Annex's John Tuckner\nsaid\n.\nNew Campaign Distributes Masslogger Malware\n— Encoded Visual Basic Script (VBE) files likely distributed via phishing emails are being used to deliver a sophisticated variant of\nMasslogger\n, a\nstealer malware\nthat can harvest login details from the Chrome browser, log keystrokes, capture clipboard content, and upload files to a remote server. \"Initially, the variant appeared to be a typical script-based threat, but upon deeper analysis, it turned out to be a multi-stage fileless malware that heavily relies on Windows Registry to store and execute its malicious payload,\" Seqrite Labs\nsaid\n.\nWestern Companies Fail to Take Action on Funnull\n— Back in May 2025, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Philippines-based\nFunnull\nfor providing infrastructure to conduct romance baiting scams and for carrying out a supply chain attack on the widely-used Polyfill[.]io JavaScript library. However, a new analysis from\nSilent Push\nand cybersecurity journalist\nBrian Krebs\nfound that many U.S. tech companies still host accounts associated with Funnull's administrator Liu \"Steve\" Lizhi, including X, GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook, Google Groups, Medium, PayPal, WordPress, Hugging Face, Gravatar, Vercel, and Flickr, among others. The Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn, and PayPal profiles have been suspended or taken down.\nRussia Jails Man to 16 Years Over Pro-Ukrainian Cyber Attacks\n— Russia has\nsentenced\na man to 16 years in a high-security prison for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against critical infrastructure in the country. Andrei Smirnov was\narrested\nin 2023 in the Siberian city of Belovo and charged with treason. Russian officials said Smirnov joined Ukraine's \"cyber troops\" and launched the attacks at the behest of Ukrainian intelligence services.\nFileFix Gets an Upgrade\n— Security researcher mrd0x has detailed a variant of\nFileFix\n, itself a spin on the popular ClickFix social engineering tactic, that enables the execution of malicious scripts while bypassing the Mark-of-the-Web (\nMotW\n) protections in Windows by taking advantage of how web browsers handle saved HTML web pages. \"When an HTML page is saved using Ctrl + S or Right-click > 'Save as' and either 'Webpage, Single File' or 'Webpage, Complete' types were selected, then the file downloaded does not have MotW,\" the researcher\nsaid\n. \"Furthermore, this behaviour only applies if the webpage being saved has a MIME type of text/html or application/xhtml+xml.\" The new attack essentially seeks to trick users into saving an HTML page (using Ctrl+S) and renaming it to an HTML Application (HTA) file, causing it to auto-execute embedded commands within JavaScript when launched. In a possible attack scenario, an adversary could design a bogus web page that could prompt users to save backup multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes by pressing Ctrol + S and naming the file as \"MfaBackupCodes2025.hta.\" The victim is then instructed to open the HTA file to ensure that the codes are stored properly. \"The easiest way to prevent this technique from working is to remove mshta.exe from being able to run HTA files,\" the researcher pointed out. \"This is a good solution unless someone is able to utilize this technique with other file types.\"\nKeymous+, a Front for EliteStress?\n— A hacktivist group known as Keymous+ has emerged as a key player in the cyber landscape, claiming responsibility for over 700 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in 2025 alone. The group, according to\nRadware\n, claims it's made up of \"North African hackers,\" and their victim list spans government websites, telecom providers in France and India, financial platforms in Morocco and the U.A.E., educational institutions in Denmark, and manufacturing infrastructure in Israel. This seemingly random selection of targets, devoid of a clear ideological agenda or enemies, sets it apart from traditional hacktivist groups. What's more, the activity appears to be a marketing persona for a DDoS-for-hire service known as EliteStress. The discovery shows Keymous+ likely straddling the boundary between hacktivism and commercial aspirations. It also highlights a new breed of threat actors whose motives are opaque and increasingly driven by profit, offering tools of disruption at the click of a button. The development comes as Intel 471 said it\nidentified\ntwo new pro-Kremlin hacktivist groups named TwoNet and the IT Army of Russia. Both are mainly involved in DDoS attacks and surfaced earlier this year, but the latter has also been found recruiting insiders in Ukrainian critical infrastructure organizations.\nAbuse of .es TLD Surges 19x Times\n— Malicious campaigns launched from .es domains have witnessed a 19x increase from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025, making it the third most common, behind .com and .ru. \"This increase applies to both first-stage URLs (links embedded in emails or attachments) and second-stage URLs (sites visited after the embedded URLs),\" Cofense\nsaid\n. \"These second-stage URLs typically host credential phishing pages or exfiltrate information. It is these second-stage URLs that have seen the greatest increase in .es TLD abuse.\" As of May, 1,373 sub-domains hosted malicious web pages on 447 .es base domains. An interesting finding is that 99 percent of them were hosted on Cloudflare, and most of the phishing pages used a Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA. \"While Cloudflare has recently made deploying a web page quick and easy via command line with pages hosted on [.]pages[.]dev, it is unclear whether their recent move to making domains hosted by them easy to deploy has attracted threat actors to their hosting services across different platforms or if there are other reasons, such as how strict or lenient Cloudflare is with abuse complaints,\" the company said.\nRise of Malicious LNK Files\n— The weaponization of Windows shortcut (LNK) files for malware distribution has increased by 50%, according to telemetry data gathered by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, with malicious samples rising from 21,098 in 2023 to 68,392 in 2024. \"The flexibility of LNK files makes them a powerful tool for attackers, as they can both execute malicious content and masquerade as legitimate files to deceive victims into unintentionally launching malware,\" Unit 42 researchers\nsaid\n.\nPercentages of system targets for malicious file execution\nFBI Investigates Ransomware Negotiator for Extortion Kickbacks\n— The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is probing a former employee of security firm DigitalMint for allegedly taking a cut from ransomware payments. According to\nBloomberg\n, the employee is said to have assisted the company's customers in negotiating ransoms during ransomware attacks. But unknown to them, the employee had secret deals with ransomware gangs to take a slice of the ransom the companies ended up paying. DigitalMint said it fired the employee as soon as it heard of the investigation and started notifying its customers.\nCloudflare Open-Sources Orange Meets\n— Cloudflare has implemented end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to its video calling app Orange Meets and open-sourced the solution for transparency. The web infrastructure company said the solution is powered by Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs) and uses Messaging Layer Security (MLS) to establish end-to-end encryption for group communication. \"To do so, we built a WASM (compiled from Rust) service worker that sets up an MLS group and does stream encryption and decryption, and designed a new joining protocol for groups, called the designated committer algorithm, and formally modeled it in TLA+,\" Cloudflare\nsaid\n.\nRussia to Build Database of Known Scammers\n— The Russian government has\nannounced\nplans to build a database of known telephone scammers that will include voice samples, phone numbers, and caller IDs. Once the service\nlaunches\non April 1, 2026, mobile operators in the country are expected to show scam warnings on phone screens for calls coming from known scam numbers. The voice recordings will be shared with law enforcement for possible investigations.\nC4 Bomb to Bypass App-Bound Encryption in Google Chrome\n— Last year, Google introduced a new security measure called\napp-bound encryption\nto prevent information-stealing malware from grabbing cookies on Windows systems. While stealers have since\nfound ways\nto defeat this guardrail, CyberArk has detailed another method dubbed C4 (short for Chrome Cookie Cipher Cracker) Attack, which makes it possible to decrypt the cookies as a low-privileged user. \"Furthermore, this technique also allowed us to abuse Google's new security feature to attack Windows machines and access data that should typically only be available to the privileged SYSTEM user,\" security researcher Ari Novick\nsaid\n. The technique essentially employs a\npadding oracle attack\nto brute-force the encryption and bypass the SYSTEM-DPAPI, recovering the cookie key. Following responsible disclosure in December 2024, Google has put in place a \"partial solution\" to remediate the padding oracle attack. But it's disabled by default.\nExploit Attempts Target Apache Tomcat and Camel Flaws\n— Malicious actors are probing for servers running vulnerable versions of Apache Tomcat and Camel that are unpatched against\nCVE-2025-24813\n,\nCVE-2025-27636, and CVE-2025-29891\nto achieve remote code execution. Palo Alto Networks\nsaid\nit blocked 125,856 probes/scans/exploit attempts originating from more than 70 countries related to these vulnerabilities in March 2025.\nLet's Encrypt Begins Issuing Certificates for IP Addresses\n— Let's Encrypt has\nstarted\nthis month issuing certificates for IP addresses. These certificates are short-lived and valid only for six days – a trend pointing to\ndeclining certificate lifespans\n. Potential scenarios where one might need an IP address certificate include use cases like serving a default page for hosting providers, accessing a website without a domain name, securing DNS over HTTPS (DoH) services, protecting network-attached storage servers, and safeguarding ephemeral connections within cloud hosting infrastructure.\nGoogle Open-Sources Privacy Tech for Age Verification\n— As online services increasingly introduce age verification barriers, Google has open-sourced its Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) libraries to help people verify their age without giving up sensitive information. \"In layperson's terms, ZKP makes it possible for people to prove that something about them is true without exchanging any other data,\" Google\nsaid\n. \"So, for example, a person visiting a website can verifiably prove he or she is over 18, without sharing anything else at all.\" The ZKP library, called\nLongfellow ZK\n, is currently being vetted by independent academic and industry experts. The results of the reviews are expected to be available by August 1, 2025.\nApple Adds ML-KEM to iOS and macOS 26\n— Speaking of cryptographic solutions, Apple is adding post-quantum cryptography support to its operating systems. The upcoming versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS will support the\nFIPS 203\n(aka ML-KEM) cryptography algorithm by means of a hybrid, quantum-secure key exchange. \"The ClientHello message from iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26 and visionOS 26 devices will include X25519MLKEM768 in the supported_groups extension, along with a corresponding key share in the key_share extension,\" Apple\nsaid\n. \"Servers can select X25519MLKEM768 if they support it, or use another group advertised in the ClientHello message.\"\nSpain Arrests 2 for Leaking Personal Data of Government Officials\n— Spanish police arrested a 19-year-old computer science student and an accomplice for allegedly leaking the personal data of senior government officials and journalists. The main suspect, identified as Yoel OQ, was detained at his parents' home on the island of Gran Canaria. His alleged accomplice, Cristian Ezequiel SM, was also arrested, according to\nlocal media\nciting law enforcement sources. The duo has been\ndescribed\nas a \"serious threat to national security.\"\nAT&T Launches Wireless Account Lock to Prevent Sim Swapping Attacks\n— U.S. mobile carrier AT&T has launched a new feature to lock accounts and prevent SIM swapping attacks.\nWireless Account Lock\ncan be enabled exclusively via AT&T's myAT&T app. Once enabled, it blocks any changes to a customer's billing details or wireless number transfers until it's disabled again. Similar features already exist on other carriers like T-Mobile, Verizon, and Google Fi. \"The lock forces an extra step before important account changes can be made. It prevents anyone from buying a device on the account, for example, or conducting a SIM swap – moving a phone number to a SIM in a different device,\" AT&T\nsaid\n.\nPakistani Freelancers Behind Websites That Deploy Stealers\n— A group of Pakistani freelance web developers is behind a network of more than 300 websites advertising cracked software that infects users with information-stealing malware, per Intrinsec. It's believed that these websites have been built for a third party and that the group incorporates search engine optimization techniques and Google Ads to maximize visibility and victim engagement. \"Additionally, little can be done to prosecute Pakistani individuals behind these malicious activities as there is no extradition treaty between the US and Pakistan,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"Servers and domains can be seized but it is only a temporary measure until new ones are rebuilt.\" The development coincides with the emergence of new stealer variants like\nAmatera Stealer\n(ACR Stealer) and\nOdyssey Stealer\n(Poseidon Stealer), becoming the latest entrants in a\ncrowded field\nof\ninfostealer malware\n.\nSpain Details 21 Suspects in Connection with Investment Scam\n— Spanish authorities have\ndetained\n21 suspects on charges of running an investment scam ring. The group operated call centers in Barcelona and used social media ads to promote fake investment platforms and trick hundreds of victims across the country into investing their funds in them, netting the gang over €10 million ($11.8 million). In late June 2025, U.S. authorities\nextradited\na Ghanaian national, Joseph Kwadwo Badu Boateng, to face charges related to a romance and inheritance scheme targeting the elderly from 2013 through March 2023. Last week, a 41-year-old Nigerian man named Ehis Lawrence Akhimie pleaded guilty on similar charges in a separate case. \"Akhimie admitted to defrauding over $6 million from more than 400 victims, many of whom were elderly or otherwise vulnerable,\" the U.S. Justice Department\nsaid\n.\nChinese Student Sentenced to Prison in U.K. for Smishing Campaign\n— Ruichen Xiong, a student from China, has been sentenced in a London court for operating an SMS Blaster to conduct a mass smishing campaign against victims with an aim to harvest their personal details between March 22 and 27, 2025. \"The equipment was programmed to send out SMS messages to victims within a nearby radius of the blaster, designed to look like trustworthy messages from genuine organisations, such as government bodies, where the victim was encouraged to click a link,\" British trade association UK Finance\nsaid\n. \"The link would subsequently take them to a malicious site that was designed to harvest their personal details.\"\nMicrosoft Takes Steps Against Email Bombing and File System Redirection Attacks\n— Microsoft revealed that it's rolling out an email bombing protection feature by default in Exchange Online Protection and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plans to counter the risks posed by\nattacks\nthat\nseek to flood target inboxes\nwith thousands of messages by subscribing their email addresses to a large number of legitimate newsletter and subscription services. \"By intelligently tracking message volumes across different sources and time intervals, this new detection leverages historical patterns of the sender and signals related to spam content. It prevents mail bombs from being dropped into the user's inbox and the messages are rather sent to the Junk folder (of Outlook),\" Microsoft\nsaid\n. Separately, the tech giant has also detailed a new mitigation called\nRedirectionGuard\nthat it has put in place in Windows 11 to mitigate file system redirection attacks.\nHunters International Shuts Down\n— In an unusual turn of events, the Hunters International ransomware operation has shut down and promised to release free decryption keys for all past victims. The group announced the shutdown in a message posted on its dark web leak site on July 3, 2025. \"After careful consideration and in light of recent developments, we have decided to close the Hunters International project,\" the gang wrote on its darknet extortion site. It did not elaborate on what these \"recent developments\" were. The operation\nlaunched\nin November 2023 and was a rebrand of the Hive ransomware, which had its infrastructure seized earlier that year. The demise of Hunters International is not surprising, given that a report from Group-IB earlier this year\nfound\nthat the group had already rebranded again and launched an extortion-only operation known as World Leaks. Despite these claims, French security firm Lexfo\nsaid\nit identified World Leaks victims that had ransomware deployed on their network before being extorted. According to\nDataBreaches.net\n, World Leaks is operated by individuals previously associated with Hunters International. World Leaks has also claimed that they are no longer in touch with Hunters International. However, Group-IB said the shutdown is \"designed to control the narrative and delay attribution.\"\n🎥 Cybersecurity Webinars\nThe Future of Logins: AI, Trust, and Privacy Collide\n-\nUsers are rejecting creepy AI and demanding frictionless logins—and the stakes have never been higher. This webinar reveals exclusive findings from the Auth0 2025 Trends Report, exposing how identity threats are evolving and how leading teams are designing trust-first login flows that users love. If you're still relying on outdated UX patterns or ignoring privacy shifts, you're already falling behind.\nYour Pip Install Might Be Malware—Here's How to Fix It\n-\nPip install isn't just risky—it's dangerous. Repójacking, fake packages, and infected containers are quietly poisoning thousands of apps. This isn't a theory—it's happening right now. Join top security experts to uncover how the Python ecosystem is being attacked, what tools like Sigstore and SLSA actually do, and the real steps you need to secure your builds before it's too late.\n🔧 Cybersecurity Tools\nCloudFlare's Orange Meets\n- It is a fully end-to-end encrypted video calling app that runs entirely on the client side—no changes needed to the server or SFU. Built with WebRTC, Rust, and Messaging Layer Security (MLS), it supports secure group calls with real-time key rotation and formally verified joining logic. It's open source, scalable, and ready to use or customize.\nOctelium\n- It is a free, open source, self-hosted platform for secure, zero trust access to internal and cloud resources. It replaces VPNs, tunnels, and gateways with identity-based, secret-less access and fine-grained, policy-driven control. Built on Kubernetes, it supports both client and browser-based access, and works for apps, APIs, SSH, databases, and more—without exposing your infrastructure.\nDisclaimer: These newly released tools are for educational use only and haven't been fully audited. Use at your own risk—review the code, test safely, and apply proper safeguards.\n🔒 Tip of the Week\nShrink Your Attack Surface with Smart Defaults -\nMany cyberattacks begin by leveraging legitimate Windows features that are rarely needed by most users or environments. Office macros, Windows Script Host, legacy protocols like LLMNR and NetBIOS over TCP/IP, and background COM script interfaces are common culprits. But even more obscure surfaces—such as ActiveX controls, Component Object Model elevation paths, or exposed DCOM/RPC endpoints—can be entry points for lateral movement and privilege escalation.\nBeyond basic hardening, consider advanced techniques like disabling Win32 optional features via \"DISM /Online /Disable-Feature,\" disabling legacy input/output subsystems (like 16-bit support via NtVDM), or auditing unexpected network listeners using \"netstat -abno\" and \"Sysinternals TCPView.\" Apply Software Restriction Policies (SRP) or AppLocker to block execution from temp directories, USB drives, and user profile folders. Harden PowerShell with Constrained Language Mode and enable AMSI logging to catch script obfuscation attempts.\nFor users who want safe defaults without diving into the registry or GPO,\nHardentools\noffers a well-balanced baseline. It disables commonly exploited scripting engines, Office macro execution, and certain Windows Explorer behaviors with a single click. But to go further, pair it with community scripts like \"\nAttack Surface Analyzer\n\" (by Microsoft) or tools like O&O ShutUp10++ to disable telemetry and reduce exposure to cloud-connected attack vectors.\nThe more obscure the vector, the less likely defenders are monitoring it—but that's exactly why attackers love it. Effective attack surface reduction is not just about minimizing visible services; it's about knowing what's silently enabled and ensuring it's needed. This week, go beyond basic macro blocking—review what's running under the hood and shut down the silent risks.\nConclusion\nIt's one thing to defend against outside attackers—it's another when the risk is already inside. This week's revelations about stolen identities, fake hires, and silent access show how trust can be turned into a weapon.\nThe takeaway is clear: identity isn't just a login—it's a security boundary. And when that fails, everything behind it is at risk.\nFound this article interesting?  Follow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "If you didn't hear about\nIranian hackers\nbreaching US water facilities, it's because they only managed to control a single pressure station serving 7,000 people. What made this attack noteworthy wasn't its scale, but how easily the hackers gained access — by simply using the manufacturer's default password \"1111.\" This narrow escape prompted\nCISA\nto urge manufacturers to eliminate default credentials entirely, citing \"years of evidence\" that these preset passwords remain one of the most exploited weaknesses.\nWhile we wait for manufacturers to implement better security practices, the responsibility falls on IT teams. Whether you manage critical infrastructure or a standard business network, allowing unchanged manufacturer passwords in your environment is like rolling out the red carpet for attackers. Here’s what you need to know about default passwords — why they persist, their business and technical consequences, and how manufacturers can implement secure-by-design best practices.\nThe pervasive threat of default passwords\nDefault passwords — the standardized credentials like \"admin/admin\" or \"1234\" shipped with countless devices and software systems — represent a glaring security gap that attackers love to exploit. Even though their risks are well-documented, they persist in production environments for numerous reasons:\nThey simplify initial setup and configuration\nThey streamline bulk device provisioning\nThey support legacy systems with limited security options\nManufacturers lack a secure-by-design mindset\nThe consequences of using default passwords include:\nBotnet recruitment:\nAttackers scan for vulnerable devices to build massive networks aimed at compromising other devices\nRansomware entry points\n:\nHackers use default password access to establish footholds for deploying ransomware\nSupply-chain compromises:\nOne vulnerable device can provide access to entire networks or partner systems\nComplete security bypass:\nEven robust security measures become ineffective when default credentials remain active\nReal-world consequences of default password attacks\nDefault passwords have facilitated some of the most destructive cyberattacks in recent history. For example, attackers created the\nMirai botnet\nby trying factory default passwords on thousands of IoT devices. Using a list of 61 common username/password combinations, the hackers compromised more than 600,000 connected devices. The resulting botnet launched devastating DDoS attacks that reached an unprecedented 1 Tbps, temporarily disabling internet services including Twitter and Netflix, and causing millions in damages.\nSupply chains are also vulnerable to\ndefault password attacks\n, with hackers targeting OEM devices with unchanged default credentials as beachheads in multi-stage attacks. Once inside, they install backdoors that keep their access open, then gradually move through connected systems until they reach your valuable data and critical infrastructure. These default passwords effectively undermine all other security controls, providing attackers with legitimate access that bypasses even advanced threat detection systems. The UK has recently moved to\nban IoT devices shipping with default passwords\n.\nThe high cost of default password negligence\nFailing to change default passwords can create consequences that go far beyond the initial security breach, including:\nBrand damage:\nPublicized breaches erode customer trust and trigger costly recalls, crisis management campaigns, and litigation that can continue for years, with expenses easily reaching millions of dollars.\nRegulatory penalties:\nNew legislation like the EU's\nCyber Resilience Act\nand US state IoT security laws (like\nCalifornia’s\n) specifically target default password vulnerabilities, imposing significant fines for non-compliance.\nOperational burden:\nImplementing proper password policies up front is much more resourceful and cost-effective than emergency incident response, forensic analysis, and recovery efforts.\nEcosystem vulnerability:\nA single compromised device can undermine interconnected environments — halting production in smart factories, jeopardizing patient care in healthcare settings, or creating cascading failures across partner networks.\nFive secure-by-design best practices for manufacturers\nManufacturers must shift from passing security burdens to customers and instead\nbuild security into their products from inception\n:\nUnique credentials per unit:\nEmbed randomized passwords at the factory, printed on each device's label to eliminate shared default credentials across product lines.\nPassword-rotation API:\nAllow customers to rotate or revoke credentials automatically on the first boot, making credential changes part of the standard setup process.\nZero-trust onboarding:\nRequire out-of-band authentication (e.g., QR-code scanning tied to user account) to verify legitimate device setup before granting system access.\nFirmware integrity checks:\nSign and verify login modules to prevent unauthorized credential resets that could bypass security measures.\nDeveloper training and audit:\nEnforce secure-development lifecycles and run default-password scans pre-ship to catch vulnerabilities before products reach customers.\nProtecting your organization today\nUntil manufacturers fully embrace secure-by-design principles, IT professionals must immediately act against default password risks. And one of the best ways to do that is by implementing rigorous password policies that include regular device inventories and immediate credential changes during deployment.\nFor the greatest protection, consider a solution like the\nSpecops Password Policy\nto automate enforcement. Specops Password Policy simplifies Active Directory password management, allowing you to implement security standards that ensure compliance while blocking more than 4 billion unique compromised passwords. By taking these proactive steps, you’ll reduce your attack surface and protect your organization from becoming the next default password hacking headline.\nBook a live demo of Specops Password Policy today\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

        "Content": "A hacking group with ties other than Pakistan has been found targeting Indian government organizations with a modified variant of a remote access trojan (RAT) called DRAT.\nThe activity has been attributed by Recorded Future's Insikt Group to a threat actor tracked as TAG-140, which it said overlaps with\nSideCopy\n, an adversarial collective assessed to be an operational sub-cluster within Transparent Tribe (aka APT-C-56, APT36, Datebug, Earth Karkaddan, Mythic Leopard, Operation C-Major, and ProjectM).\n\"TAG-140 has consistently demonstrated iterative advancement and variety in its malware arsenal and delivery techniques,\" the Mastercard-owned company\nsaid\nin an analysis published last month.\n\"This latest campaign, which spoofed the Indian Ministry of Defence via a cloned press release portal, marks a slight but notable shift in both malware architecture and command-and-control (C2) functionality.\"\nThe updated version of DRAT, called DRAT V2, is the latest addition to SideCopy's RAT arsenal, which also\ncomprises\nother tools\nlike Action RAT, AllaKore RAT, Ares RAT, CurlBack RAT, ReverseRAT, Spark RAT, and Xeno RAT to infect Windows and Linux systems.\nThe attack activity demonstrates the adversary's evolving playbook, highlighting its ability to refine and diversify to an \"interchangeable suite\" of RAT malware to harvest sensitive data to complicate attribution, detection, and monitoring efforts.\nAttacks orchestrated by the threat actor have broadened their targeting focus beyond government, defense, maritime, and academic sectors to encompass organizations affiliated with the country's railway, oil and gas, and external affairs ministries. The group is known to be active since at least 2019.\nThe infection sequence documented by Recorded Future leverages a\nClickFix\n-style approach that spoofs the Indian Ministry of Defence's official press release portal to drop a .NET-based version of DRAT to a new Delphi-compiled variant.\nThe counterfeit website has one active link that, when clicked, initiates an infection sequence that surreptitiously copies a malicious command to the machine's clipboard and urges the victim to paste and execute it by launching a command shell.\nThis causes the retrieval of an HTML Application (HTA) file from an external server (\"trade4wealth[.]in\"), which is then executed by means of mshta.exe to launch a loader called BroaderAspect. The loader is responsible for downloading and launching a decoy PDF, setting up persistence through Windows Registry changes, and downloading and running DRAT V2 from the same server.\nDRAT V2 adds a new command for arbitrary shell command execution, improving its post-exploitation flexibility. It also obfuscates its C2 IP addresses using Base64-encoding and updates its custom server-initiated TCP protocol to support commands input in both ASCII and Unicode. However, the server responds only in ASCII. The original DRAT requires Unicode for both input and output.\n\"Compared to its predecessor, DRAT V2 reduces string obfuscation by keeping most command headers in plaintext, likely prioritizing parsing reliability over stealth,\" Recorded Future said. \"DRAT V2 lacks advanced anti-analysis techniques and relies on basic infection and persistence methods, making it detectable via static and behavioral analysis.\"\nOther known capabilities allow it to perform a wide range of actions on compromised hosts, including conducting reconnaissance, uploading additional payloads, and exfiltrating data.\n\"These functions provide TAG-140 with persistent, flexible control over the infected system and allow for both automated and interactive post-exploitation activity without requiring the deployment of auxiliary malware tools,\" the company said.\n\"DRAT V2 appears to be another modular addition rather than a definitive evolution, reinforcing the likelihood that TAG-140 will persist in rotating RATs across campaigns to obscure signatures and maintain operational flexibility.\"\nAPT36 Campaigns Deliver Ares RAT and DISGOMOJI\nState-sponsored threat activity and\ncoordinated hacktivist operations\nfrom Pakistan flared up during the\nIndia-Pakistan conflict\nin May 2025, with APT36 capitalizing on the events to distribute Ares RAT in attacks targeting defense, government, IT, healthcare, education, and telecom sectors.\n\"With the deployment of tools like Ares RAT, attackers gained complete remote access to infected systems – opening the door to surveillance, data theft, and potential sabotage of critical services,\" Seqrite Labs\nnoted\nback in May 2025.\nRecent APT36 campaigns have been found to disseminate carefully crafted phishing emails containing malicious PDF attachments to target Indian defense personnel.\nThe messages masquerade as purchase orders from the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and persuade the recipients to click on a button embedded within the PDF documents. Doing so results in the download of an executable that deceptively displays a PDF icon and employs the double extension format (i.e., *.pdf.exe) to appear legitimate to Windows users.\nThe binary, besides featuring anti-debugging and anti-VM features to sidestep analysis, is designed to launch a next-stage payload in memory that can enumerate files, log keystrokes, capture clipboard content, obtain browser credentials, and contact a C2 server for data exfiltration and remote access.\n\"APT36 poses a significant and ongoing cyber threat to national security, specifically targeting Indian defense infrastructure,\" CYFIRMA\nsaid\n. \"The group's use of advanced phishing tactics and credential theft exemplifies the evolving sophistication of modern cyber espionage.\"\nThe hacking crew has also lived up to its advanced persistent threat (APT) status by specifically targeting systems running BOSS Linux, a distribution widely utilized by Indian government agencies, via phishing messages that drop malicious ELF binaries designed to facilitate unauthorized access to infected hosts using cybersecurity advisories as a lure.\n\"The deployment of Linux-specific malware signifies a noteworthy advancement in APT36's operational capabilities and highlights the increasing risk posed to critical government and defense infrastructure,\" CYFIRMA\nsaid\n. \"This multi-stage approach is intended to bypass user suspicion and evade traditional security measures, enabling threat actors to gain persistent access to sensitive environments.\"\nAnother campaign detailed by 360 Threat Intelligence Center has leveraged a new variant of a Go-based malware referred to as\nDISGOMOJI\nas part of booby-trapped ZIP files distributed via phishing attacks. The malware, the Beijing-based cybersecurity company said, is an ELF executable program written in Golang and uses Google Cloud for C2, marking a shift from Discord.\n\"In addition, browser theft plug-ins and remote management tools will be downloaded to achieve further theft operations and remote control,\" it\nsaid\n. \"The function of downloading the DISGOMOJI variant is similar to the load found before, but the previous DISGOMOJI used the Discord server, while this time it used Google Cloud Service for communication.\"\nConfucius Drops WooperStealer and Anondoor\nThe findings come as the cyber espionage actor known as Confucius has been linked to a new campaign that deploys an information stealer called\nWooperStealer\nand a previously undocumented modular backdoor Anondoor.\nConfucius is\nassessed\nto be a threat group operating with objectives that align with India. It's believed to be active since at least 2013, targeting government and military units in South Asia and East Asia.\nAccording to Seebug's KnownSec 404 Team, the multi-stage attacks employ Windows Shortcut (LNK) files as a starting point to deliver Anondoor using DLL side-loading techniques, following which system information is collected and WooperStealer is fetched from a remote server.\nThe backdoor is fully-featured, enabling an attacker to issue commands that can execute commands, take screenshots, download files, dump passwords from the Chrome browser, as well as list files and folders.\n\"It has evolved from the previously exposed single espionage trojan of downloading and executing to a modular backdoor, demonstrating a relatively high ability of technological iteration,\" KnownSec 404 Team\nsaid\n. \"Its backdoor component is encapsulated in a C# DLL file and evaded sandbox detection by loading the specified method through invoke.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Researchers have released proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for a critical Citrix NetScaler vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-5777 and dubbed CitrixBleed2, warning that the flaw is easily exploitable and can successfully steal user session tokens.\nThe CitrixBleed 2 vulnerability, which affects Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway devices, allows attackers to retrieve memory contents simply by sending malformed POST requests during login attempts.\nThis flaw is named CitrixBleed2 as it closely resembles the original\nCitrixBleed\n(CVE-2023-4966) bug from 2023, which was\nexploited by ransomware gangs\nand in\nattacks on governments\nto hijack user sessions and breach networks.\nIn technical analyses first released by watchTowr and then Horizon3, researchers confirmed that the vulnerability can be exploited by sending an incorrect login request, where the login= parameter is modified so it's sent without an equal sign or value.\nThis causes the NetScaler appliance to display the memory contents up to the first null character in the <InitialValue></InitialValue> section of the response, as shown below.\nReading data from memory with a malformed NetScaler login request\nSource: WatchTowr\nThe flaw is caused by the use of the\nsnprintf\nfunction along with a format string containing the\n%.*s\nformat string.\n\"The %.*s format tells snprintf: “Print up to N characters, or stop at the first null byte (\\\\0) - whichever comes first.” That null byte eventually appears somewhere in memory, so while the leak doesn’t run indefinitely, you still get a handful of bytes with each invocation,\" explains\nwatchTowr's report\n.\n\"So, every time you hit that endpoint without the =, you pull more uninitialized stack data into the response.\"\nAccording to\nHorizon3\n, each request leaks approximately 127 bytes of data from data, allowing attackers to perform repeated HTTP requests to extract additional memory contents until they find the sensitive data they are looking for.\nWhile the attempts by WatchTowr were unsuccessful, Horizon3 demonstrates in the video below that they could exploit this flaw to steal user session tokens.\nIn addition to NetScaler endpoints, Horizon3 states that the flaw can also be exploited against configuration utilities used by administrators.\nExploited or not?\nCitrix continues to state that the flaw is not actively being exploited, and when BleepingComputer previously inquired about its status, the company referred us to a\nblog post\nabout the vulnerability.\n\"Currently, there is no evidence to suggest exploitation of\nCVE-2025-5777\n,\" reads the blog post.\nHowever, a June report by cybersecurity firm ReliaQuest indicates that there is evidence that CVE-2025-5777 may have been exploited in attacks, with the company seeing an increase in user session hijacks.\nFurthermore, security researcher\nKevin Beaumont disputes Citrix's statement\n, saying the vulnerability has been actively exploited since mid-June, with attackers leveraging the bug to dump memory and hijack sessions.\nHe highlighted the following indicators of compromise:\nIn Netscaler logs, repeated POST requests to *doAuthentication* - each one yields 126 bytes of RAM\nIn Netscaler logs, requests to doAuthentication.do with \"Content-Length: 5\"\nIn Netscaler user logs, lines with *LOGOFF* and user = \"*#*\" (i.e. # symbol in the username). RAM is played into the wrong field.\n\"Worth noting I was only able to find exploitation activity due to the WatchTowr and Horizon3 write ups,\" warned Beaumont.\n\"Citrix support wouldn't disclose any IOCs and incorrectly claimed (again — happened with CitrixBleed) that no exploitation [was] in the wild. Citrix have gotta get better at this, they're harming customers.\"\nCitrix has released patches to address CVE-2025-5777, and all organizations are strongly urged to apply them immediately now that public exploits are available.\nWhile Citrix recommends terminating all active ICA and PCoIP sessions, administrators should first review existing sessions for any suspicious activity before doing so.\n8 Common Threats in 2025\nWhile cloud attacks may be growing more sophisticated, attackers still succeed with surprisingly simple techniques.\nDrawing from Wiz's detections across thousands of organizations, this report reveals 8 key techniques used by cloud-fluent threat actors.\nGet the Report\nRelated Articles:\nNew 'CitrixBleed 2' NetScaler flaw let hackers hijack sessions\nCitrix Bleed 2 flaw now believed to be exploited in attacks\nCitrix warns of NetScaler vulnerability exploited in DoS attacks\nCitrix warns of login issues after NetScaler auth bypass patch\nOver 1,200 Citrix servers unpatched against critical auth bypass flaw"

        "Content": "Malware analyst discovered a new version of the Atomic macOS info-stealer (also known as 'AMOS') that comes with a backdoor, to attackers persistent access to compromised systems.\nThe new component allows executing arbitrary remote commands, it survives reboots, and permits maintaining control over infected hosts indefinitely.\nMacPaw's cybersecurity division Moonlock analyzed the backdoor in Atomic malware after a tip from independent researcher\ng0njxa\n, a close observer of infostealer activity.\n\"AMOS malware campaigns have already reached over 120 countries, with the United States, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada among the most affected,\" the researchers say.\n\"The backdoored version of Atomic macOS Stealer now has the potential to gain full access to thousands of Mac devices worldwide.\"\nCirculation of unique Atomic stealer samples\nSource: Moonlock\nEvolution of the Atomic stealer\nThe Atomic stealer,\nfirst documented in April 2023\n, is a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) operation promoted on Telegram channels for a hefty subscription of $1,000 per month. It targets macOS files, cryptocurrency extensions, and user passwords stored on web browsers.\nIn November 2023, it supported the first-ever\nexpansion of 'ClearFake'\ncampaigns onto macOS, while in September 2024, it was spotted in a large-scale campaign by the cybercrime group'\nMarko Polo\n,' who deployed it on Apple computers.\nMoonlock reports that Atomic has recently shifted from broad distribution channels like cracked software sites, to targeted phishing aimed at cryptocurrency owners, as well as job interview invitations to freelancers.\nThe analyzed version of the malware comes with an embedded backdoor, uses of LaunchDaemons to survive reboots on macOS, ID-based victim tracking, and new command-and-control infrastructure.\nEvolution of the Atomic stealer\nSource: Moonlock\nA backdoor into your Mac\nThe core backdoor executable is a binary named '.helper,' downloaded and saved in the victim's home directory as a hidden file post-infection, the\nresearchers say\n.\nA persistent wrapper script named '.agent' (also hidden) runs '.helper' in a loop as the logged-in user, while a LaunchDaemon (com.finder.helper) installed via AppleScript ensures that '.agent' executes at system startup.\nThis action is performed with elevated privileges using the user's password stolen during the initial infection phase under a false pretext. The malware can then execute commands and change ownership of the LaunchDaemon PLIST to 'root:wheel' (superuser level on macOS).\nThe backdoor execution chain\nSource: Moonlock\nThe backdoor allows the threat actors to execute commands remotely, log key strokes, introduce additional payloads, or explore lateral movement potential.\nTo evade detection, the backdoor checks for sandbox or virtual machine environments using 'system_profiler' and also features string obfuscation.\nThe evolution of Atomic malware shows that macOS users are becoming more attractive targets and malicious campaigns aimed at them are increasingly sophisticated.\n8 Common Threats in 2025\nWhile cloud attacks may be growing more sophisticated, attackers still succeed with surprisingly simple techniques.\nDrawing from Wiz's detections across thousands of organizations, this report reveals 8 key techniques used by cloud-fluent threat actors.\nGet the Report\nRelated Articles:\n'Stargazers' use fake Minecraft mods to steal player passwords\nDiscord flaw lets hackers reuse expired invites in malware campaign\nOperation Secure disrupts global infostealer malware operations\nHacker targets other hackers and gamers with backdoored GitHub code\n‘Russian Market’ emerges as a go-to shop for stolen credentials"

The breach exposed customer names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and frequent flyer numbers.\nHowever, Qantas says that no credit card or financial information, passport details, passwords, PINs, or login credentials were exposed in the breach.\nQantas is warning customers to be on the lookout for scams and phishing emails that may attempt to use the stolen data to steal further sensitive information. All legitimate emails from Qantas will be from the\nqantas.com\ndomain.\nQantas also said it will never ask customers for passwords, ticket confirmation codes, or other sensitive information by phone, text, or email.\nThe Qantas breach is part of attacks targeting the aviation sector by threat actors linked to\nScattered Spider\n. These threat actors are skilled at social engineering attacks used to gain initial access to corporate networks, commonly by tricking help desks and support vendors into resetting employees' passwords and MFA.\nThe threat actors behind these attacks first targeted the retail sector in April, with breaches on\nMarks & Spencer (M&S)\nand\nCo-o\np.\nFor M&S, the group gained access by impersonating an employee and convincing a service desk vendor to reset passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections.\nThe group later\nshifted its focus to insurance companies\n, and more recently, the\naviation and transportation industries\n, with attacks on\nWestJet\nand\nHawaiian Airlines\nlinked to the threat actors.\nQantas says it is working with cybersecurity experts and the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, and the Australian Federal Police to investigate the attack.\nBleepingComputer contacted Qantas with further questions regarding the extortion and will update this article if we hear back.\n8 Common Threats in 2025\nWhile cloud attacks may be growing more sophisticated, attackers still succeed with surprisingly simple techniques.\nDrawing from Wiz's detections across thousands of organizations, this report reveals 8 key techniques used by cloud-fluent threat actors.\nGet the Report\nRelated Articles:\nHunters International ransomware shuts down, releases free decryptors\nHunters International shifts from ransomware to pure data extortion\nScania confirms insurance claim data breach in extortion attempt\nPowerSchool hacker pleads guilty to student data extortion scheme\nCoinbase data breach exposes customer info and government IDs"
