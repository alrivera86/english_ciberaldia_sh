        "Content": "Virtualization and networking infrastructure have been targeted by a threat actor codenamed\nFire Ant\nas part of a prolonged cyber espionage campaign.\nThe activity, observed this year, is primarily designed Now to infiltrate organizations' VMware ESXi and vCenter environments as well as network appliances, Sygnia said in a new report published today.\n\"The threat actor leveraged combinations of sophisticated and stealthy techniques creating multilayered attack kill chains to facilitate access to restricted and segmented network assets within presumed to be isolated environments,\" the cybersecurity company\nsaid\n.\n\"The attacker demonstrated a high degree of persistence and operational maneuverability, operating through eradication efforts, adapting in real time to eradication and containment actions to maintain access to the compromise infrastructure.\"\nFire Ant is assessed to share tooling and targeting overlaps with prior campaigns orchestrated by\nUNC3886\n, a China-nexus cyber espionage group known for its persistent targeting of edge devices and virtualization technologies since at least 2022.\nAttacks mounted by the threat actor have been found to establish entrenched control of VMware ESXi hosts and vCenter servers, demonstrating advanced capabilities to pivot into guest environments and bypass network segmentation by compromising network appliances.\nAnother noteworthy aspect is the ability of the threat actor to maintain operational resilience by adapting to containment efforts, switching to different tools, dropping fallback backdoors for persistence, and altering network configurations to re-establish access to compromised networks.\nFire Ant's breach of the virtualization management layer is achieved by the exploitation of\nCVE-2023-34048\n, a known security flaw in VMware vCenter Server that has been exploited by UNC3886 as a zero-day for years prior to it being patched by Broadcom in October 2023.\n\"From vCenter, they extracted the 'vpxuser' service account credentials and used them to access connected ESXi hosts,\" Sygnia noted. \"They deployed multiple persistent backdoors on both ESXi hosts and the vCenter to maintain access across reboots. The backdoor filename, hash and deployment technique aligned the VIRTUALPITA malware family.\"\nAlso dropped is a Python-based implant (\"autobackup.bin\") that provides remote command execution, and file download and upload capabilities. It runs in the background as a daemon.\nUpon gaining unauthorized access to the hypervisor, the attackers are said to have leveraged another flaw in VMware Tools (\nCVE-2023-20867\n) to interact directly with guest virtual machines via PowerCLI, as well as interfered with the functioning of security tools and extracted credentials from memory snapshots, including that of domain controllers.\nSome of the other crucial aspects of the threat actor's tradecraft are as follows -\nDropping V2Ray framework to facilitate guest network tunneling\nDeploying unregistered virtual machines directly on multiple ESXi hosts\nBreaking down network segmentation barriers and establishing cross-segments persistence\nResist incident response and remediation efforts by re-compromising assets and, in some cases, blend in by renaming their payloads to impersonate forensic tools\nThe attack chain ultimately opened up a pathway for Fire Ant to maintain persistent, covert access from the hypervisor to guest operating systems. Sygnia also described the adversary as possessing a \"deep understanding\" of the target environment's network architecture and policies in order to reach otherwise isolated assets.\nFire Ant is unusually focused on remaining undetected and leaves a minimal intrusion footprint. This is evidenced in the steps taken by the attackers to tamper with logging on ESXi hosts by terminating the \"vmsyslogd\" process, effectively suppressing an audit trail and limiting forensic visibility.\nThe findings underscore a worrying trend involving the persistent and successful\ntargeting\nof\nnetwork edge devices\nby\nthreat actors\n, particularly\nthose from China\n, in recent years.\n\"This campaign underscores the importance of visibility and detection within the hypervisor and infrastructure layer, where traditional endpoint security tools are ineffective,\" Sygnia said.\n\"Fire Ant consistently targeted infrastructure systems such as ESXi hosts, vCenter servers, and F5 load balancers. The targeted systems are rarely integrated into standard detection and response programs. These assets lack detection and response solutions and generate limited telemetry, making them ideal long-term footholds for stealthy operation.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new versatile malware loader called\nCastleLoader\nthat has been put to use in campaigns distributing various information stealers and remote access trojans (RATs).\nThe activity employs Cloudflare-themed\nClickFix\nphishing attacks and fake GitHub repositories opened under the names of legitimate applications, Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe malware loader, first observed in the wild earlier this year, has been used to distribute\nDeerStealer\n,\nRedLine\n,\nStealC\n,\nNetSupport RAT\n,\nSectopRAT\n, and even other loaders like\nHijack Loader\n.\n\"It employs dead code injection and packing techniques to hinder analysis,\" the company said. \"After unpacking itself at runtime, it connects to a C2 (command-and-control) server, downloads target modules, and executes them.\"\nCastleLoader's modular structure allows it to act as both a delivery mechanism and a staging utility, enabling threat actors to separate initial infection from payload deployment. This separation complicates attribution and response because it decouples the infection vector from the eventual malware behavior, giving attackers more flexibility in adapting campaigns over time.\nCastleLoader payloads are distributed as portable executables containing an embedded shellcode, which then invokes the main module of the loader that, in turn, connects to the C2 server in order to fetch and execute the next-stage malware.\nAttacks distributing the malware have relied on the prevalent ClickFix technique on domains posing as software development libraries, videoconferencing platforms, browser update notifications, or document verification systems, ultimately tricking users into copying and executing PowerShell commands that activate the infection chain.\nVictims are directed to the bogus domains through Google searches, at which point they are served pages containing fake error messages and CAPTCHA verification boxes developed by the threat actors, asking them to carry out a series of instructions to supposedly address the issue.\nAlternatively, CastleLoader leverages fake GitHub repositories mimicking legitimate tools as a distribution vector, causing users who unknowingly download them to compromise their machines with malware instead.\n\"This technique exploits developers' trust in GitHub and their tendency to run installation commands from repositories that appear reputable,\" PRODAFT said.\nThis strategic abuse of social engineering mirrors techniques used in initial access brokers (IABs), underscoring its role within a broader cybercrime supply chain.\nPRODAFT said it has observed Hijack Loader being delivered via DeerStealer as well as CastleLoader, with the latter also propagating DeerStealer variants. This suggests the overlapping nature of these campaigns, despite them being orchestrated by different threat actors.\nSince May 2025, CastleLoader campaigns have leveraged seven distinct C2 servers, with over 1,634 infection attempts recorded during the time period. Analysis of its C2 infrastructure and its web-based panel—which is used to oversee and manage the infections – shows that as many as 469 devices were compromised, resulting in an infection rate of 28.7%.\nResearchers also observed elements of anti-sandboxing and obfuscation—features typical in advanced loaders like SmokeLoader or IceID. Combined with PowerShell abuse, GitHub impersonation, and dynamic unpacking, CastleLoader reflects a growing trend in stealth-first malware loaders that operate as stagers in malware-as-a-service (MaaS) ecosystems.\n\"Castle Loader is a new and active threat, rapidly adopted by various malicious campaigns to deploy an array of other loaders and stealers,\" PRODAFT\nsaid\n. \"Its sophisticated anti-analysis techniques and multi-stage infection process highlight its effectiveness as a primary distribution mechanism in the current threat landscape.\"\n\"The C2 panel demonstrates operational capabilities typically associated with malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings, suggesting the operators have experience in cybercriminal infrastructure development.\"\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "You wouldn't run your blue team once a year, so why accept this substandard schedule for your offensive side?\nYour cybersecurity teams are under intense pressure to be proactive and to find your network's weaknesses before adversaries do. But in many organizations, offensive security is still treated as a one-time event: an annual pentest, a quarterly red team engagement,\nmaybe an audit sprint before a compliance deadline\n.\nThat's not defense. It's a theater.\nIn the real world,\nadversaries don't operate in bursts.\nTheir recon is continuous, their tools and tactics are always evolving, and new vulnerabilities are often reverse-engineered into working exploits within hours of a patch release.\nSo, if your offensive validation isn't just as dynamic,\nyou're not just lagging, you're exposed.\nIt's time to move\nbeyond the once a year pentest.\nIt's time to build an\nOffensive Security Operations Center\n.\nWhy annual pentesting falls short\nPoint-in-time penetration tests still serve a role, and are here to remain a compliance requirement. But they fall short in environments that change faster than they can be assessed. This is true for a number of reasons:\nThe scope is limited.\nMost enterprise pentests are scoped to avoid business disruption, but we all know that attackers don't care about your scope, or unless they're in stealth mode, disrupting your business.\nControls decay silently.\nDrift is constant. An EDR policy gets loosened. A SIEM rule breaks. And annual pentests are not built to catch these problems. The security control that \"passed\" in the test may very well fail when it really matters, two weeks later.\nAccess escalates quietly.\nIn Active Directory environments, misconfigurations accumulate silently over time, nested groups, stale accounts, over-privileged service identities, and well-known privilege escalation paths are commonplace. These aren't just theoretical risks; they've been actively leveraged for decades. Attackers don't need zero-days to succeed. They rely on weak trust relationships, configuration drift, and a lack of visibility.\nTiming lags.\nBy the time a pentest report is delivered, your environment has already changed. You're chasing what\nwas\n, not what\nis\n. It's like looking at last month's video from your door camera to see what's happening today.\nHowever, this is not a call to abolish pentesting.\nQuite the opposite, manual pentests bring human creativity, contextual awareness, and adversarial thinking that no automation can replicate.\nBut relying on them alone, especially when performed only once or twice a year, limits their impact.\nBy building an Offensive SOC and operationalizing continuous validation, organizations enable pentesters to focus on what they do best:\nuncover edge cases\n,\nbypass defenses creatively\n, and\nexplore complex scenarios\nbeyond the reach of automation.\nIn short: an Offensive SOC doesn't replace pentesting, it gives it room to evolve.\nWithout continuous validation, a security posture becomes a snapshot, not a source of truth.\nFrom point-in-time defense to persistent offense\nThe\nOffensive Security Operations Center (Offensive SOC)\nflips the model from a one-off pentest as part of a decidedly defensive SOC to a team continuously out-maneuvering adversaries by thinking and acting like an attacker, every single day. Instead of waiting for trouble to respond to, the Offensive SOC is collaborative, transparent, and built to uncover tangible risks and drive actual fixes, in real time.\nThink of it this way: If a traditional SOC raises alerts on attacks that\nreach\nyou, the Offensive SOC raises alerts on vulnerabilities that\ncould\n.\nAnd the tools that power it? It's time to toss your outdated clipboards, and checklists, and power up\nBreach and Attack Simulation (BAS)\nand\nAutomated Penetration Testing\nsolutions.\nThe core pillars of the offensive SOC\n1. Continuously discovering what's exposed\nYou can't validate what you haven't found. Your organization's attack surface is rife with sprawling with cloud workloads, unmanaged assets, shadow IT, stale DNS records, and public S3 buckets. It's time to accept that periodic scans just don't cut it anymore.\nDiscovery must be persistent and continuous, just like an attacker would do.\n2. Real-world attack simulation with BAS\nBreach and Attack Simulation (BAS)\ndoesn't guess. It simulates real-world TTPs mapped to industry-recognized frameworks like\nMITRE ATT&CK®\nacross the kill chain.\nBAS answers a series of practical yet high-stakes questions:\nCan your SIEM catch a credential dumping attack?\nWill your EDR block known ransomware?\nDoes your WAF stop critical web attacks like Citrix Bleed or IngressNightmare?\nBAS is about controlled, safe, production-aware testing and executing the same techniques attackers use, against your actual controls without actually putting your data, bottom line, and reputation at risk. BAS will show you exactly what works, what fails, and where to best focus your efforts.\n3. Exploit Chain Testing with Automated Pentesting\nSometimes individual vulnerabilities may not be harmful on their own. However, adversaries carefully chain multiple vulnerabilities and misconfigurations together to achieve their objectives. With\nAutomated Penetration Testing\n, security teams can validate how a real compromise could unfold, step by step, end to end.\nAutomated Pentesting simulates an assumed breach from a domain-joined system, starting with access to a low-privileged or system-level user. From this foothold, it discovers and validates the shortest, stealthiest attack paths to critical assets, such as domain admin privileges, by chaining real techniques like credential theft, lateral movement, and privilege escalation.\nHere's an example:\nInitial access to an HR workstation exposes a Kerberoasting opportunity, triggered by misconfigured service account permissions.\nOffline password cracking reveals plaintext credentials.\nThose credentials enable lateral movement to another machine.\nEventually, the simulation captures a domain admin's NTLM hash, with no alerts triggered and no controls intervening.\nThis is just one scenario among thousands, but it mirrors the real tactics adversaries use to escalate their privileges\ninside your network\n.\n4. Drift Detection and Posture Tracking\nSecurity isn't static. Rules change. Configurations shift. Controls fail quietly.\nThe Offensive SOC keeps score over time. It tracks when your prevention and detection layer solutions start to slip, like:\nAn EDR policy update that disables known malware signatures\nA SIEM alert that quietly stops firing after a rule modification\nA firewall rule that's altered during maintenance, leaving a port exposed\nThe Offensive SOC doesn't just tell you what failed, it tells you when it started failing.\nAnd this is how you stay ahead: not by reacting to alerts, but by catching your vulnerabilities before they're exploited.\nWhere Picus fits in\nPicus helps security teams operationalize the\nOffensive SOC\n, with a unified platform that continuously validates exposures across prevention, detection, and response layers.\nWe combine:\nBAS to test how your controls respond to real-world threats.\nAutomated penetration testing to simulate attacker movement post-access, and identify high-risk paths.\nKnown threat and mitigation libraries to simulate attacks and close gaps faster.\nSeamless integration with your existing SOC stack.\nAnd Picus isn't just making promises.\nThe Blue Report 2024\nfound that:\nOrganizations using Picus\nreduced critical vulnerabilities by over 50%\n.\nCustomers\ndoubled their prevention effectiveness\nin 90 days.\nTeams\nmitigated security gaps 81% faster using Picus\n.\nWith Picus, you can boldly move beyond assumptions and make decisions backed by validation.\nThat's the value of an Offensive SOC: focused, efficient, and continuous security improvement.\nFinal thought: Validation isn't a report, it's a practice\nBuilding an\nOffensive SOC\nisn't about adding more dashboards, solutions, or noise; it's about turning your reactive security operations center into a\ncontinuous validation engine.\nIt means proving what's exploitable, what's protected, and what needs attention.\nPicus helps your security teams do exactly that, operationalizing validation across your entire stack.\nReady to explore the details?\nDownload\nThe CISO's Guide for Security and Exposure Validation\nto:\nUnderstand the complementary roles of\nBreach and Attack Simulation\nand\nAutomated Penetration Testing\nLearn how to prioritize risk based on\nexploitability, not just severity\nSee how to embed\nAdversarial Exposure Validation\ninto your CTEM strategy for continuous, measurable improvement\n🔗\nGet the Exposure Validation Guide\nand make validation part of your everyday SOC operations, not just something you check off a list once a year.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nGoogle News\n,\nTwitter\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

The web page also includes JavaScript code designed to collect the visitor's IP address and user-agent information, and exfiltrate the details to the threat actor via an HTTP POST request.\nOperation PhantomPrayers\nGh0st RAT is a fully-featured malware that supports file manipulation, screen capture, clipboard content extraction, webcam video recording, keylogging, audio recording and playback, process manipulation, and remote shell.\nThe second campaign, Operation PhantomPrayers, has been found to leverage another domain, \"hhthedalailama90.niccenter[.]net,\" to distribute a phony \"90th Birthday Global Check-in\" app (\"DalaiLamaCheckin.exe,\" dubbed PhantomPrayers) that, when opened, displays an interactive map and urges victims to \"send your blessings\" for the Dalai Lama by tapping their location on the map.\nHowever, the malicious functionality is stealthily triggered in the background, using DLL side-loading techniques to launch\nPhantomNet\n, a backdoor that establishes contact with a command-and-control (C2) server over TCP to receive additional plugin DLLs for execution on the compromised machine.\n\"PhantomNet can be set to operate only during specific hours or days, but this capability is not enabled in the current sample,\" the researchers said. \"PhantomNet used modular plugin DLLs, AES-encrypted C2 traffic, and configurable timed operations, to stealthily manage compromised systems.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The action is the result of an investigation that was launched by the French Police in July 2021.\nCoupled with the arrest, law enforcement has also taken control of the clearnet domain of XSS.is, greeting visitors with a seizure notice, \"This domain has been seized by la Brigade de Lutte Contre la Cybercriminalité with assistance of the SBU Cyber Department.\"\n\"The forum, which had more than 50,000 registered users, served as a key marketplace for stolen data, hacking tools and illicit services,\" the law enforcement agency\nsaid\n. \"It has long been a central platform for some of the most active and dangerous cybercriminal networks, used to coordinate, advertise and recruit.\"\nThe forum's administrator, besides engaging in the technical operations of the service, is said to have enabled criminal activity by acting as a trusted third-party to arbitrate disputes between criminals and guarantee the security of transactions.\nThe unnamed individual is also believed to have run thesecure.biz, a private messaging platform specially built to cater to the needs of cybercriminals. Through these illicit ventures, the suspect is estimated to have made €7 million ($8.24 million) in profits from advertising and facilitation fees.\n\"Investigators believe he has been active in the cybercrime ecosystem for nearly two decades, and maintained close ties to several major threat actors over the years,\" Europol added.\nAccording to the\nParis Prosecutor\n, XSS.is has been active since 2013, acting as a hub for all this cybercrime, ranging from access to compromised systems and ransomware-related services. It also offered an encrypted Jabber messaging server that let cybercriminals communicate anonymously.\nXSS.is, along with Exploit, has served as the backbone of the\nRussian-speaking cybercriminal ecosystem\n, with the threat actors on these forums primarily singling out non-Russian-speaking countries. Data shared by KELA shows that XSS currently has 48,750 registered users and more than 110,000 threads.\n\"To facilitate illicit transactions, the forum has a built-in reputation system,\" KELA\nsaid\n. \"Members can use a forum-appointed escrow service to ensure that deals are completed without scams, as well as add a deposit, contributing to their reputation.\"\nThe development comes a week after a Europol-led operation\ndisrupted\nthe online infrastructure associated with a pro-Russian\nhacktivist group\nknown as NoName057(16) and the arrest of two people for conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Ukraine and its allies using a volunteer-driven Go-based tool called DDoSia.\nRecorded Future's Insikt Group, in a report published this week, said the group targeted 3,776 unique hosts between July 1, 2024, and July 14, 2025, primarily government, public-sector, transportation, technology, media, and financial entities in European nations opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nUkrainian organizations accounted for the largest share of targets (29.47%), followed by France (6.09%), Italy (5.39%), Sweden (5.29%), Germany (4.60%), Israel (4.50%), Czechia (4%), Poland (4%), and the United Kingdom (3.30%). The United States is a notable exclusion, despite its support for Ukraine.\nAn extensive analysis of NoName057(16)'s infrastructure has laid bare a resilient, multi-tiered architecture consisting of rapidly rotated Tier 1 command-and-control (C2) servers and Tier 2 servers protected by access control lists (ACLs) to limit upstream access and maintain reliable C2 functionality. As many as 275 unique Tier 1 have been identified during the time period.\n\"The threat group maintains a high operational tempo, averaging 50 unique targets daily, with intense bursts of activity correlating to geopolitical and military developments in Ukraine,\" the Mastercard-owned cybersecurity company\nsaid\n.\n\"NoName057(16) uses a mixture of network and application-layer DDoS attacks, selecting methods designed to overwhelm server resources and disrupt availability. The threat group's attack methodology is straightforward yet effective, prioritizing high-volume floods and resource exhaustion techniques.\"\nFound this article interesting?

They are located in the \"wp-content/mu-plugins\" directory by default.\nWhat makes them an\nattractive option for attackers\nis that mu-plugins do not show in the default list of plugins on the Plugins page of wp-admin and cannot be disabled except by removing the plugin file from the must-use directory.\nAs a result, a piece of malware that leverages this technique allows it to function quietly, without raising any red flags.\nIn the infection spotted by web security company Sucuri, the PHP script in the mu-plugins directory (\"wp-index.php\") serves as a loader to fetch a next-stage payload and save it in the WordPress database within the\nwp_options table\nunder _hdra_core.\nThe remote payload is retrieved from a URL that's obfuscated using\nROT13\n, a simple substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it (i.e., A becomes N, B becomes O, C becomes P, and so forth).\n\"The fetched content is then temporarily written to disk and executed,\" security researcher Puja Srivastava\nsaid\n. \"This backdoor gives the attacker persistent access to the site and the ability to run any PHP code remotely.\nSpecifically, it injects a hidden file manager into the theme directory as \"pricing-table-3.php,\" permitting threat actors to browse, upload, or delete files. It also creates an administrator user named \"officialwp\" and then downloads a malicious plugin (\"wp-bot-protect.php\") and activates it.\nBesides reinstating the infection in the event of deletion, the malware incorporates the ability to change the passwords of common administrator usernames, such as \"admin,\" \"root,\" and \"wpsupport,\" to a default password set by the attacker. This also extends to its own \"officialwp\" user.\nIn doing so, the threat actors can enjoy persistent access to the sites and perform malicious actions, while effectively locking out other administrators. This can range from data theft to injecting code that can serve malware to site visitors or redirect them to other scammy sites.\n\"The attackers gain full administrator access and a persistent backdoor, allowing them to do anything on the site, from installing more malware to defacing it,\" Srivastava said. \"The remote command execution and content injection features mean the attackers can change the malware's behavior.\"\nTo mitigate against these threats, it's essential that site owners update WordPress, themes, and plugins periodically, secure accounts using two-factor authentication, and regularly audit all sections of the site, including theme and plugin files.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "A new Linux malware named Koske may have been developed with artificial intelligence and is using seemingly benign JPEG images of panda bears to deploy malware directly into system memory.\nResearchers from cybersecurity company AquaSec analyzed Koske and described it as \"a sophhisticated Linux threat.\" Based on the observed adaptive behavior, the researchers believe that the malware was developed using large language models (LLMs) or automation frameworks.\nKoske’s purpose is to deploy CPU and GPU-optimized cryptocurrency miners that use the host’s computational resources to mine over 18 distinct coins.\nAquaSec identified Serbia-based IP addresses used in the attacks, Serbian phrases in the scripts, and Slovak language in the GitHub repository hosting the miners, but it could make no confident attribution.\nPandas attack\nInitial access is achieved by leveraging misconfigurations of JupyterLab instances exposed online to achieve command execution.\nAfter gaining a foothold, the attacker downloads two .JPEG images of panda bears hosted on legitimate services like OVH images, freeimage, and postimage. However, the pictures hide malicious payloads.\nAquaSec underlines that the threat actor did not use\nsteganography\nto hide the malware inside images but relied on\npolyglot files\n, which are valid in multiple formats.\nIn Koske attacks, the same file can be interpreted as both an image and a script, depending on the application that opens or processes it.\nWhile the panda pics feature valid image headers for the JPEG format, they also include malicious shell scripts and C code at the end, allowing both formats to be interepreted separately.\nA user opening them will see a cute panda bear but a script interpreter will execute the shell code appended at the end of the file.\nSeemingly innocuous panda image (top), file contents (bottom)\nSource: AquaSec\nThe attacks AquaSec discovered hide one payload in each image, both launched in parallel.\n“One payload is C code written directly to memory, compiled, and executed as a shared object .so file that functions as a rootkit,”\nexplains AquaSec\n.\n“The second is a shell script, also executed from memory, which uses standard system utilities to run stealthily and maintain persistence while leaving few visible traces.”\nThe shell script is executed directly in memory by abusing native Linux utilities, establishing persistence via cron jobs that run every 30 minutes, and custom\nsystemd\nservices.\nIt also performs network hardening and proxy evasion, overwriting\n/etc/resolv.conf\nto use Cloudflare and Google DNS, locking it using the\nchattr +i\ncommand, flushing iptables, resetting proxy variables, and using a custom module to brute-force working proxies via curl, wget, and raw TCP checks.\nThis type of adaptability and behavior is what led AquaSec researchers to suspect that the threat actor developed the malware either with the help of a LLM or an automation platform.\nThe C-based rootkit is compiled in memory and uses\nLD_PRELOAD\nto override the readdir() function, hiding malware-related processes, files, and directories from user-space monitoring tools.\nThe rootkit filters entries based on strings like koske, hideproc, or by reading hidden PIDs from /dev/shm/.hiddenpid.\nAfter establishing network access and setting up persistence, the shell script downloads cryptominers from GitHub.\nComplete attack chain\nSource: AquaSec\nBefore deployment, the host’s CPU and GPU are evaluated to determine which miner would be the most efficient choice.\nKoske supports mining for 18 different coins, including the hard-to-trace Monero, Ravencoin, Zano, Nexa, and Tari.\nIf a coin or mining pool becomes unavailable, the malware automatically switches to a backup from its internal list, indicating a high degree of automation and adaptability.\nAquaSec warns that while AI-powered malware like Koske is already concerning, future variants may leverage real-time adaptability, evolving into a far more dangerous class of threats.\nThe Board Report Deck CISOs Actually Use\nCISOs know that getting board buy-in starts with a clear, strategic view of how cloud security drives business value.\nThis free, editable board report deck helps security leaders present risk, impact, and priorities in clear business terms.

The file uses PowerShell (‘worker.ps1’) to fetch the main payload from\nsoft-gets[.]com\n.\nFickle Stealer is an info-stealer that harvests data stored in web browsers, such as account credentials, auto-fill information, cookies, and cryptocurrency wallet data.\nEncryptHub used the same malware in a massive spear-phishing and social engineering campaign last year, which compromised\nover six hundred organizations\nworldwide.\nThe threat actor is a peculiar case in the cybercrime space as they are linked to both\nmalicious exploitation\nof Windows zero-day vulnerabilities and\nresponsible disclosures\nof critical flaws to Microsoft.\n“The compromised executable appears legitimate to users downloading from Steam, creating an effective social engineering component that relies on platform trust rather than traditional deception techniques,” reads the report Prodaft shared with BleepingComputer.\n“When users click on the Playtest of this game, which they find in the free games, they are actually downloading malicious software,” the researchers say.\nOverview of the EncryptHub attack\nSource: Prodaft\nProdaft explains that the malware is running in the background and does not impact gameplay performance, leaving gamers clueless of the compromise.\nIt is unclear how EncryptHub managed to add the malicious files to the game project but one explanation could be an insider helping out. The developer of the game has not published any official statements on their game's Steam page or on social media.\nBleepingComputer has contacted both Chemia and Valve with a request for comments and we will update this post when we receive a response.\nMeanwhile, the game remains available on Steam, and it is unclear if the latest version is clean of malware or still dangerous to download. Until official announcements are made from Steam, it would be better to avoid it entirely.\nThis is the third case of malware slipping into Steam this year. The previous ones were ‘\nSniper: Phantom’s Resolution\n’ in March, and ‘\nPirateFi\n’ in February.\nIn all three cases, the titles were early access games and not stable releases, which may indicate more lax reviewing procedures from Steam on such titles.

Ensure that the MX-ONE system is deployed within a trusted network. The risk may be mitigated by restricting access to the Provisioning Manager service,\"\nMitel said\n.\nCustomers running MiVoice MX-ONE version 7.3 and later are advised to submit a patch request to the company through their authorized service partner.\nToday, Mitel also disclosed a\nhigh-severity SQL injection vulnerability\n(CVE-2025-52914) in its MiCollab collaboration platform, which can be abused to execute arbitrary SQL database commands on unpatched devices.\nWhile these two security bugs have not been tagged as exploited in the wild, CISA\nwarned U.S. federal\nagencies\nin January of a MiCollab path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2024-55550) used in attacks and allowed authenticated threat actors with admin privileges to read arbitrary files on vulnerable servers.\nOne month earlier, the company\npatched a MiCollab arbitrary file read zero-day bug\n(CVE-2024-41713) discovered by watchTowr Labs researchers, which could let attackers access files on a server's file system.\nMitel's products are used by over 60,000 customers and more than 75 million users across various sectors, including education, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, and government.\nThe Board Report Deck CISOs Actually Use\nCISOs know that getting board buy-in starts with a clear, strategic view of how cloud security drives business value.\nThis free, editable board report deck helps security leaders present risk, impact, and priorities in clear business terms.

GTIG believes UNC6148 engages in data theft and extortion attacks, and may also deploy Abyss ransomware (also tracked as VSOCIETY).\nWhile investigating these attacks, the investigators found evidence suggesting that the threat actor had stolen the credentials for the targeted appliance in January by exploiting multiple vulnerabilities (\nCVE-2021-20038\n,\nCVE-2024-38475\n,\nCVE-2021-20035\n,\nCVE-2021-20039\n,\nCVE-2025-32819\n).\nSonicWall 'strongly' advised customers using SMA 100 virtual or physical appliances to check them for indicators of compromise (IoCs) from GTIG's report by checking for unauthorized access and reviewing appliance logs and connection history for suspicious activity. If they find any evidence of compromise, administrators are advised to reach out to SonicWall Support immediately for assistance.\nTo secure their devices, users should limit remote management access on external interfaces, reset all passwords, and reinitialize OTP (One-Time Password) binding for both users and administrators. They should also enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enable the Web Application Firewall (WAF).\nEarlier this year, SonicWall flagged other security vulnerabilities exploited in attacks targeting its Secure Mobile Access (SMA) appliances.\nIn May, the company\nprompted customers\nto patch three security vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-32819, CVE-2025-32820, and CVE-2025-32821) that could be chained to gain remote code execution as root, one of which was tagged as exploited in attacks.\nOne month earlier, SonicWall\ntagged another SMA100 flaw\n(CVE-2021-20035) as exploited in remote code execution attacks\nsince at least January 2025\n.\nCloud Detection & Response for Dummies\nContain emerging threats in real time - before they impact your business.\nLearn how cloud detection and response (CDR) gives security teams the edge they need in this practical, no-nonsense guide.\nGet the Guide\nRelated Articles:\nCisco: Maximum-severity ISE RCE flaws now exploited in attacks\nMax severity Cisco ISE bug allows pre-auth command execution, patch now\nSonicWall SMA devices hacked with OVERSTEP rootkit tied to ransomware\nHackers are exploiting critical RCE flaw in Wing FTP Server\nPerfektBlue Bluetooth flaws impact Mercedes, Volkswagen, Skoda cars"

        "Content": "KrebsOnSecurity recently heard from a reader whose boss’s email account got phished and was used to trick one of the company’s customers into sending a large payment to scammers. An investigation into the attacker’s infrastructure points to a long-running Nigerian cybercrime ring that is actively targeting established companies in the transportation and aviation industries.\nImage: Shutterstock, Mr. Teerapon Tiuekhom.\nA reader who works in the transportation industry sent a tip about a recent successful phishing campaign that tricked an executive at the company into entering their credentials at a fake Microsoft 365 login page. From there, the attackers quickly mined the executive’s inbox for past communications about invoices, copying and modifying some of those messages with new invoice demands that were sent to some of the company’s customers and partners.\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the reader said the resulting phishing emails to customers came from a newly registered domain name that was remarkably similar to their employer’s domain, and that at least one of their customers fell for the ruse and paid a phony invoice. They said the attackers had spun up a look-alike domain just a few hours after the executive’s inbox credentials were phished, and that the scam resulted in a customer suffering a six-figure financial loss.\nThe reader also shared that the email addresses in the registration records for the imposter domain — roomservice801@gmail.com — is tied to many such phishing domains. Indeed, a search on this email address at DomainTools.com finds it is associated with at least 240 domains registered in 2024 or 2025. Virtually all of them mimic legitimate domains for companies in the aerospace and transportation industries worldwide.\nAn Internet search for this email address reveals a humorous blog post from 2020 on the Russian forum hackware[.]ru, which found roomservice801@gmail.com was tied to a phishing attack that used the lure of phony invoices to trick the recipient into logging in at a fake Microsoft login page. We’ll come back to this research in a moment.\nDomainTools shows that some of the early domains registered to roomservice801@gmail.com in 2016 include other useful information. For example, the WHOIS records for alhhomaidhicentre[.]biz reference the technical contact of “Justy John” and the email address justyjohn50@yahoo.com.\nA search at DomainTools found justyjohn50@yahoo.com has been registering one-off phishing domains since at least 2012. At this point, I was convinced that some security company surely had already published an analysis of this particular threat group, but I didn’t yet have enough information to draw any solid conclusions.\nDomainTools says the Justy John email address is tied to more than two dozen domains registered since 2012, but we can find hundreds more phishing domains and related email addresses simply by pivoting on details in the registration records for these Justy John domains. For example, the street address used by the Justy John domain axisupdate[.]net — 7902 Pelleaux Road in Knoxville, TN — also appears in the registration records for accountauthenticate[.]com, acctlogin[.]biz, and loginaccount[.]biz, all of which at one point included the email address rsmith60646@gmail.com.\nThat Rsmith Gmail address is connected to the 2012 phishing domain alibala[.]biz (one character off of the Chinese e-commerce giant alibaba.com, with a different top-level domain of .biz). A search in DomainTools on the phone number in those domain records — 1.7736491613 — reveals even more phishing domains as well as the Nigerian phone number “2348062918302” and the email address michsmith59@gmail.com.\nDomainTools shows michsmith59@gmail.com appears in the registration records for the domain seltrock[.]com, which was used in the phishing attack documented in the 2020 Russian blog post mentioned earlier. At this point, we are just two steps away from identifying the threat actor group.\nThe same Nigerian phone number shows up in dozens of domain registrations that reference the email address sebastinekelly69@gmail.com, including 26i3[.]net, costamere[.]com, danagruop[.]us, and dividrilling[.]com. A Web search on any of those domains finds they were indexed in an “indicator of compromise” list on GitHub maintained by Palo Alto Networks‘ Unit 42 research team.\nAccording to Unit 42, the domains are the handiwork of a vast cybercrime group based in Nigeria that it dubbed “SilverTerrier” back in 2014. In an October 2021 report, Palo Alto said SilverTerrier excels at so-called “business e-mail compromise” or BEC scams, which target legitimate business email accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion activities. BEC criminals use that access to initiate or redirect the transfer of business funds for personal gain.\nPalo Alto says SilverTerrier encompasses hundreds of BEC fraudsters, some of whom have been arrested in various international law enforcement operations by Interpol. In 2022, Interpol and the Nigeria Police Force arrested 11 alleged SilverTerrier members, including a prominent SilverTerrier leader who’d been flaunting his wealth on social media for years. Unfortunately, the lure of easy money, endemic poverty and corruption, and low barriers to entry for cybercrime in Nigeria conspire to provide a constant stream of new recruits.\nBEC scams were the 7th most reported crime tracked by the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) in 2024, generating more than 21,000 complaints. However, BEC scams were the second most costly form of cybercrime reported to the feds last year, with nearly $2.8 billion in claimed losses. In its 2025 Fraud and Control Survey Report, the Association for Financial Professionals found 63 percent of organizations experienced a BEC last year.\nPoking at some of the email addresses that spool out from this research reveals a number of Facebook accounts for people residing in Nigeria or in the United Arab Emirates, many of whom do not appear to have tried to mask their real-life identities. Palo Alto’s Unit 42 researchers reached a similar conclusion, noting that although a small subset of these crooks went to great lengths to conceal their identities, it was usually simple to learn their identities on social media accounts and the major messaging services.\nPalo Alto said BEC actors have become far more organized over time, and that while it remains easy to find actors working as a group, the practice of using one phone number, email address or alias to register malicious infrastructure in support of multiple actors has made it far more time consuming (but not impossible) for cybersecurity and law enforcement organizations to sort out which actors committed specific crimes.\n“We continue to find that SilverTerrier actors, regardless of geographical location, are often connected through only a few degrees of separation on social media platforms,” the researchers wrote.\nPalo Alto has published a useful list of recommendations that organizations can adopt to minimize the incidence and impact of BEC attacks. Many of those tips are prophylactic, such as conducting regular employee security training and reviewing network security policies.\nBut one recommendation — getting familiar with a process known as the “financial fraud kill chain” or FFKC — bears specific mention because it offers the single best hope for BEC victims who are seeking to claw back payments made to fraudsters, and yet far too many victims don’t know it exists until it is too late.\nImage: ic3.gov.\nAs explained in this FBI primer, the International Financial Fraud Kill Chain is a partnership between federal law enforcement and financial entities whose purpose is to freeze fraudulent funds wired by victims. According to the FBI, viable victim complaints filed with ic3.gov promptly after a fraudulent transfer (generally less than 72 hours) will be automatically triaged by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).\nThe FBI noted in its IC3 annual report (PDF) that the FFKC had a 66 percent success rate in 2024. Viable ic3.gov complaints involve losses of at least $50,000, and include all records from the victim or victim bank, as well as a completed FFKC form (provided by FinCEN) containing victim information, recipient information, bank names, account numbers, location, SWIFT, and any additional information.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Thursday 24th of July 2025 01:57 PM \r\n         \nI was able to create a free email account with a well-known provider with that username.  Let me know if you want it Brian and I will happily hand it over to you.\nTo reduce the chance of a successful phishing, it would be useful if e-mail providers were to add an option that would only allow you to send e-mail to addresses in your contact list and disallow the automatic adding of addresses to your contact list.\nIn other words, presumably the address you entered in your address book is valid.  If you respond to an e-mail that purports to be someone you deal with, the current practice is to automatically assume that every e-mail you receive is from who it claims to be from and that you can respond to it without worry about it being bogus.\nFor example, suppose your e-mail is security@example.com and you get an e-mail from the president of your company, president@exampl.com, asks you to send them certain information.  Presumably, you would have president@example.com, not president@exampl.com in your contact list.  Replying to president@exampl.com ought to throw up some very strong red flags.  One way to do it would be to require every e-mail address in your contact list to have been personally added.\nEven if they use the address president@example.com, it would be difficult to catch homograph scams using a different character set, for example, maybe with Cyrillic characters.  If you could optionally require e-mails going out to addresses that are in your address book, it would flag domain names with other character sets unless the user entered them into their address book in that script.\nAnother thing that would help is if people would digitally sign their e-mails and encrypt them. That way if you got something from president@example.com, but not signed with their key and you had the filters set up to flag unsigned e-mails as being untrustworthy, then you would have some notice. I’ve pretty much given up on getting people to encrypt and sign e-mails, though.\nContinuing on…\nOne thing I have done for certain critical things such as banking and credit cards is to create unique e-mail addresses with long and unpredictable user names.  Only one recipient gets that address. I have set up filters to flag any e-mail coming in from that bank or credit card company that is not to my unique address for that bank or credit card company with a “WARNING” tag.  That way, if a scammer sends a phishing e-mail to me purporting to be from First State Bank of Fishermen, I won’t be at all likely to think it is legitimate.\nI wish I could do that with SMS messages.  SMS messges are inherently untrustworthy and are very widely abused. Other than “Honey, remember today is trash day”, they should never be trusted without some form of verificaiton.  I try to discourage people from sending me anything by SMS messages, but it doesn’t help.\nYour email address will not be published.

The data was reportedly released today, following a compromise that is said to have occurred on May 23, 2025. The publication of the data comes after the ransomware group’s deadline for negotiations apparently passed, with the group issuing a final warning: “Our group gives you the last chance to continue negotiations or the data will be published before time runs out.”\nNew American Funding is a significant player in the United States mortgage industry, providing a wide range of home loan services to customers across the nation.\nThe company’s importance in the financial sector makes this alleged data leak a serious concern, potentially impacting a large number of borrowers.\nThe origin of the attack is attributed to the Everest ransomware group, a known cybercriminal organization with a history of targeting prominent entities.\nRecent reports indicate that a ransomware attack by the Everest group was linked to a security incident at one of New American Funding’s third-party vendors, Mobile Notary Zone, which was first disclosed in June 2025.\nThe full extent of the published data is not yet publicly detailed, but based on initial breach notifications stemming from the third-party vendor incident, the compromised information could be extensive. The types of data allegedly stolen and now potentially released to the public include:\nFull names\nAddresses\nSocial Security numbers\nDates of birth\nGovernment-issued IDs\nFinancial account information\nMedical information\nThis incident highlights the growing threat of ransomware attacks and the cascading effect of supply chain vulnerabilities, where a breach at a single vendor can have significant consequences for larger organizations and their customers.\nTags:\nCyberSecurity\ndata-breach\ndata-leak\nEverest ransomware\nmortgage lender\nNew American Funding\nransomware"

        "Content": "Following a multi-year investigation, the alleged administrator of the notorious Russian-speaking cybercrime forum, XSS.is, has been arrested in Kyiv, Ukraine. The operation was a collaborative effort between French and Ukrainian authorities, with significant support from Europol. XSS.is, formerly known as DaMaGeLaB, has been a prominent marketplace for cybercriminals since 2013, boasting over 50,000 registered users. The platform served as a central hub for the trade of stolen data, hacking tools, and various other illicit services, making it one of the most significant forums in the Russian-speaking cybercrime ecosystem.\nThe arrested individual is suspected of not only managing the technical aspects of the forum but also acting as a key facilitator of criminal activities. This included arbitrating disputes between cybercriminals and guaranteeing the security of their transactions. The administrator is also believed to have operated a secure messaging service, thesecure.biz, tailored for the needs of the cybercriminal underground. Through these alleged illicit activities, the suspect is estimated to have made over €7 million. The takedown of the forum’s infrastructure and the arrest of its administrator represent a significant blow to the cybercrime community that relied on the platform for its operations.\nThe investigation, initiated by the French Police in 2021, involved extensive monitoring of the forum’s activities and associated infrastructure. The collaborative effort between international law enforcement agencies highlights the global nature of cybercrime and the importance of cross-border cooperation in combating it. The seizure of the XSS.is domain and the arrest of its alleged administrator will likely disrupt the activities of numerous cybercriminal networks that used the platform to coordinate, advertise, and recruit for their malicious operations.\nTags:\nArrest\ncybercrime\nCyberSecurity\ndark web\nEuropol\nFrance\nlaw enforcement\nmarketplace\nUkraine\nXSS.is"
