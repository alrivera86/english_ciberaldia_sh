        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a now-patched critical security flaw in a popular vibe coding platform called Base44 that could allow unauthorized access to private applications built by its users.\n\"The vulnerability we discovered was remarkably simple to exploit -- by providing only a non-secret app_id value to undocumented registration and email verification endpoints, an attacker could have created a verified account for private applications on their platform,\" cloud security firm Wiz\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\nA net result of this issue is that it bypasses all authentication controls, including Single Sign-On (SSO) protections, granting full access to all the private applications and data contained within them.\nFollowing responsible disclosure on July 9, 2025, an official fix was rolled out by Wix, which owns Base44, within 24 hours. There is no evidence that the issue was ever maliciously exploited in the wild.\nWhile\nvibe coding\nis an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered approach designed to generate code for applications by simply providing as input a text prompt, the latest findings highlight an emerging attack surface, thanks to the popularity of AI tools in enterprise environments, that may not be adequately addressed by traditional security paradigms.\nThe shortcoming unearthed by Wiz in Base44 concerns a misconfiguration that left two authentication-related endpoints exposed without any restrictions, thereby permitting anyone to register for private applications using only an \"app_id\" value as input -\napi/apps/{app_id}/auth/register, which is used to register a new user by providing an email address and password\napi/apps/{app_id}/auth/verify-otp, which is used to verify the user by providing a one-time password (OTP)\nAs it turns out, the \"app_id\" value is not a secret and is visible in the app's URL and in its manifest.json file path. This also meant that it's possible to use a target application's \"app_id\" to not only register a new account but also verify the email address using OTP, thereby gaining access to an application that they didn't own in the first place.\n\"After confirming our email address, we could just login via the SSO within the application page, and successfully bypass the authentication,\" security researcher Gal Nagli said. \"This vulnerability meant that private applications hosted on Base44 could be accessed without authorization.\"\nThe development comes as security researchers have shown that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) tools can be jailbroken or subjected to prompt injection attacks and make them behave in unintended ways, breaking free of their ethical or safety guardrails to produce malicious responses, synthetic content, or hallucinations, and, in some cases, even\nabandon correct answers\nwhen presented with false counterarguments, posing risks to multi-turn AI systems.\nSome of the attacks that have been documented in recent weeks include -\nA \"toxic\" combination of improper validation of context files, prompt injection, and misleading user experience (UX) in\nGemini CLI\nthat could\nlead\nto silent execution of malicious commands when inspecting untrusted code.\nUsing a special crafted email hosted in Gmail to\ntrigger\ncode execution through Claude Desktop by tricking Claude to rewrite the message such that it can bypass restrictions imposed on it.\nJailbreaking xAI's Grok 4 model using\nEcho Chamber and Crescendo\nto\ncircumvent\nthe model's safety systems and elicit harmful responses without providing any explicit malicious input. The LLM has also been\nfound\nleaking restricted data and abiding hostile instructions in over 99% of prompt injection attempts absent any hardened system prompt.\nCoercing OpenAI ChatGPT into\ndisclosing\nvalid Windows product keys via a guessing game\nExploiting Google Gemini for Workspace to\ngenerate\nan email summary that looks legitimate but includes malicious instructions or warnings that direct users to phishing sites by embedding a hidden directive in the message body using HTML and CSS trickery.\nBypassing Meta's Llama Firewall to\ndefeat\nprompt injection safeguards using prompts that used languages other than English or simple obfuscation techniques like leetspeak and invisible Unicode characters.\nDeceiving browser agents into\nrevealing\nsensitive information such as credentials via prompt injections attacks.\n\"The AI development landscape is evolving at unprecedented speed,\" Nagli said. \"Building security into the foundation of these platforms, not as an afterthought – is essential for realizing their transformative potential while protecting enterprise data.\"\nThe disclosure comes as Invariant Labs, the research division of Snyk, detailed toxic flow analysis (TFA) as a way to harden agentic systems against Model Control Protocol (\nMCP\n) exploits like\nrug pulls\nand\ntool poisoning attacks\n.\n\"Instead of focusing on just prompt-level security, toxic flow analysis pre-emptively predicts the risk of attacks in an AI system by constructing potential attack scenarios leveraging deep understanding of an AI system's capabilities and potential for misconfiguration,\" the company\nsaid\n.\nFurthermore, the MCP ecosystem has introduced traditional security risks, with as many as 1,862 MCP servers exposed to the internet sans any authentication or access controls, putting them at risk of data theft, command execution, and abuse of the victim's resources, racking up cloud bills.\n\"Attackers may find and extract OAuth tokens, API keys, and database credentials stored on the server, granting them access to all the other services the AI is connected to,\" Knostic\nsaid\n.\nFound this article interesting?

This method is harder to detect because there are no error messages or failed logins to trigger suspicion.\nPyPI said it's looking at different methods to handle the attack. In the meanwhile, it's urging users to inspect the URL in the browser before signing in and refrain from clicking on the link if they have already received such emails.\nIf you're unsure whether an email is legitimate, a quick check of the domain name—letter by letter—can help. Tools like browser extensions that highlight verified URLs or password managers that auto-fill only on known domains can add a second layer of defense. These kinds of attacks don't just trick individuals; they aim to gain access to accounts that may publish or manage widely used packages.\n\"If you have already clicked on the link and provided your credentials, we recommend changing your password on PyPI immediately,\" Fiedler said. \"Inspect your account's Security History for anything unexpected.\"\nIt's currently not clear who is behind the campaign, but the activity bears striking similarities to a\nrecent npm phishing attack\nthat employed a typosquatted domain \"npnjs[.]com\" (as opposed to \"npmjs[.]com\") to send similar email verification emails to capture users' credentials.\nThe attack ended up compromising seven different npm packages to deliver a malware called Scavenger Stealer to gather sensitive data from web browsers. In one case, the attacks paved the way for a JavaScript payload that captured system information and environment variables, and exfiltrated the details over a WebSocket connection.\nSimilar attacks have been seen across npm, GitHub, and other ecosystems where trust and automation play a central role. Typosquatting, impersonation, and reverse proxy phishing are all tactics in this growing category of social engineering that exploits how developers interact with tools they rely on daily.\nFound this article interesting?

A majority of the victims are located in the United States, based on\ndata\nfrom Ransomware.live.\nCompatible with Windows, ESXi, Linux and NAS systems, Chaos has been observed seeking ransoms of $300,000 from victims in exchange for a decryptor and a \"detailed penetration overview with main kill chain and security recommendations.\"\nThe attacks involve a combination of phishing and voice phishing techniques to obtain initial access by tricking victims into installing remote desktop software, particularly\nMicrosoft Quick Assist\n.\nThe threat actors subsequently carry out post-compromise discovery and reconnaissance, followed by installing other RMM tools such as AnyDesk, ScreenConnect, OptiTune, Syncro RMM, and Splashtop to establish persistent remote access to the network.\nAlso undertaken are steps to harvest credentials, delete PowerShell event logs, and delete security tools installed on the machine to undermine detection. The attacks culminate with the deployment of the ransomware, but not before lateral movement and data exfiltration using GoodSync.\nThe ransomware binary supports multithreading to facilitate rapid encryption of both local and network resources, all while blocking recovery efforts and implementing multi-layered anti-analysis techniques to evade debugging tools, virtual machine environments, automated sandboxes, and other security platforms.\nThe links to BlackSuit stem from similarities in the tradecraft employed, including in the encryption commands, the theme and structure of the ransom note, and the RMM tools used. It's worth noting that BlackSuit is a rebrand of the Royal ransomware group, which, in itself, was an offshoot of Conti, highlighting the shape-shifting nature of the threat.\nThe development comes around the same time BlackSuit's dark web sites were seized as part of a joint law enforcement effort called Operation Checkmate. Visitors are greeted by a splash screen that states, \"This site has been seized by U.S. Homeland Security Investigations as part of a coordinated international law enforcement investigation.\" There has been no official statement from authorities on the takedown.\nIn a related move, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DoJ)\npublicly\nannounced\nthe seizure of 20.2891382 BTC (now valued at over $2.4 million) from a cryptocurrency wallet address associated with a member of the Chaos ransomware group known as Hors.\nChaos is the latest entrant to the ransomware landscape, which has also witnessed the arrival of other new strains like\nBackups\n,\nBert\n,\nBlackFL\n,\nBQTLOCK\n,\nDark 101\n, Gunra,\nJackalock\n,\nMoscovium\n,\nRedFox\n, and\nSinobi\n.

        "Content": "Until recently, the cyber attacker methodology behind the biggest breaches of the last decade or so has been pretty consistent:\nCompromise an endpoint via software exploit, or social engineering a user to run malware on their device;\nFind ways to move laterally inside the network and compromise privileged identities;\nRepeat as needed until you can execute your desired attack — usually stealing data from file shares, deploying ransomware, or both.\nBut attacks have fundamentally changed as networks have evolved. With the SaaS-ification of enterprise IT, core business systems aren't locally deployed and centrally managed in the way they used to be. Instead, they're logged into over the internet, and accessed via a web browser.\nAttacks have shifted from targeting local networks to SaaS services, accessed through employee web browsers.\nUnder the shared responsibility model, the part that's left to the business consuming a SaaS service is mostly constrained to how they manage identities — the vehicle by which the app is accessed and used by the workforce. It's no surprise that this has become the soft underbelly in the crosshairs of attackers.\nWe've seen this time and again in the biggest breaches of recent years, with the highlights including the massive\nSnowflake campaign in 2024\nand the\n2025 crime wave attributed to Scattered Spider\n.\nThese attacks are so successful because while attackers have moved with the changes to enterprise IT, security hasn't really kept up.\nThe browser is the new battleground — and a security blind spot\nTaking over workforce identities is the first objective for attackers looking to target an organization, and the browser is the place where the attacks against users happen. This is because it's where these digital identities are created and used — and their credentials and sessions live. This is what the attacker wants to get their hands on.\nStolen credentials can be used as part of targeted attacks or in broader credential stuffing (cycling known username and credential pairs against various apps and platforms), while stolen session tokens can be used to log in directly to an active session, bypassing the authentication process.\nThere are a few different techniques that attackers can use to get access to these identities. Attackers harvest stolen credentials from various places —\ndata breach dumps\n,\nmass\ncredential\nphishing campaigns,\ninfostealer logs\n, even\nmalicious browser extensions\nthat they've tricked an employee into installing. In fact, the cyber crime ecosystem itself has shifted on its axis to cater to this, with hackers specifically taking on the role of harvesting credentials and establishing account access for others to exploit.\nThe high-profile\nSnowflake\nbreaches in 2024 signalled a watershed moment in the shift to identity-driven breaches, where attackers logged into accounts across hundreds of customer tenants using stolen credentials. One of the primary sources of the stolen credentials used in the attacks were infostealer logs dating back to 2020 — breached passwords that hadn't been rotated or mitigated with MFA.\nInfostealers are notable because they're an endpoint malware attack designed to harvest credentials and session tokens (primarily from the browser) to enable the attacker to then log into those services… through their own web browser.\nSo, even today's endpoint attacks are seeing the attacker pivot back into the browser in order to get to identities — the key to the online apps and services where exploitable data and functionality now resides.\nAttacks in the browser vs. on the browser\nThere's an important distinction to be made between attacks that happen in the browser, vs. those happening against the browser itself.\nThere's growing consensus that\nthe browser is the new endpoint\n. But the analogy isn't perfect — the reality is that web browsers have a comparatively limited attack surface compared to the complexity of the traditional endpoint — comparing something like Google Chrome with a Windows OS seems a very unbelievable concept.\nAttacks that target the browser itself as a mechanism to compromise identities are few and far between. One of the more obvious vectors is using malicious browser extensions — so, scenarios in which a user has either:\nBeen lured into installing an already malicious extension, or\nIs using a browser extension that is later compromised by an attacker\nBut the problem of malicious extensions is something you solve once, and then move on. The reality is that users should not be installing random browser extensions, and given the risk, you should:\nLock down your environment to allow only a handful of essential extensions.\nMonitor for indicators that an extension you trust is compromised.\nThis doesn't apply in an environment where you give users full access to install whatever extensions they choose.\nBut if the browser is the new endpoint, this is a bit like all your users being local admins — you're asking for trouble.\nAnd locking down extensions in your organizations is something that can be achieved using native tools if you're, for example, a\nChrome Enterprise\ncustomer. Audit your users once, approve only what's needed, and require further approval to install new extensions.\nIdentity is the prize, browser is the platform — and phishing is the weapon of choice\nBut the technique that's STILL driving the most impactful identity-driven breaches?\nIt's phishing\n. Phishing for credentials, sessions, OAuth consent, authorization codes. Phishing via email, instant messenger, social media, malicious Google ads… it all happens in, or leads to, the browser.\nAll phishing roads lead to the browser, regardless of the delivery channel.\nAnd modern phishing attacks are more effective than ever. Today, phishing operates on an industrial scale, using an array of obfuscation and detection evasion techniques to block email and network security tools from intercepting them. Probably the most common example today is the use of bot protection (think CAPTCHA or Cloudflare Turnstile), using legitimate anti-spam features to block security tools.\nCloudflare Turnstile is a simple way for security teams to prevent automated analysis — it should probably come with a trigger warning for incident responders.\nThe latest generation of fully customized AitM phishing kits are dynamically obfuscating the code that loads the web page, implementing custom CAPTCHA, and using runtime anti-analysis features, making them increasingly difficult to detect. The ways in which links are delivered has also increased in sophistication, with more delivery channels (as we showed above) and the use of legitimate SaaS services for camouflage.\nAnd the latest trends indicate that attackers are responding to increasingly hardened IdP/SSO configuration by exploiting alternative phishing techniques that\ncircumvent MFA and passkeys\n, most commonly by\ndowngrading to a phishable backup authentication method\n— which you can see in action below, and\nread more about here\n.\nIdentities are the lowest-hanging fruit for attackers to aim for\nThe goal of the modern attacker, and the easiest way into your business's digital environment, is to compromise identities. Whether you're dealing with phishing attacks, malicious browser extensions, or infostealer malware, the objective remains the same — account takeover.\nOrganizations are dealing with a vast and vulnerable attack surface consisting of:\nHundreds of applications, with thousands of accounts\nspread across the app estate.\nAccounts vulnerable to MFA-bypass phishing kits, because they are using a login method that is not phishing-resistant, or because\nthe login method can be downgraded\n.\nAccounts with a weak, reused, or breached password and no MFA altogether (usually the result of a forgotten-about\nghost login\n).\nBypassing the authentication process entirely to evade otherwise phishing-resistant authentication methods, by abusing features like\nAPI key creation\n,\napp-specific passwords\n, OAuth\nconsent phishing\n,\ncross-IdP impersonation\n, and more.\nA 1,000 user organization has over 15,000 accounts with various configurations and associated vulnerabilities.\nA key driver of identity vulnerability is the\nhuge variance in the configurability of accounts per application\n, with different levels of centralized visibility and security control of identities provided — for example, while one app can be locked down to only accept SSO logins via SAML and automatically remove any unused passwords, another provides no control or visibility of login method or MFA status (another big driver of the\nSnowflake\nbreaches last year). Unfortunately, as a by-product of product-led growth and something that is compounded by every new SaaS startup that hits the market, this situation doesn't look like it's going to change anytime soon.\nThe end result is that identities are misconfigured, invisible to the security team, and routinely exploited by commodity attacker tooling. It's no surprise that they're the primary target for attackers today.\nGhost logins, AitM phishing, downgrade attacks, and app-level configuration issues are fuelling identity-based breaches.\nThe solution: The browser as a telemetry source and control point\nBecause identity attacks play out in the browser, it's the perfect place for security teams to observe, intercept, and shut down these attacks.\nThe browser has a number of advantages over the different places where identity can be observed and protected, because:\nYou aren't limited to the apps and identities directly connected to your IdP (a fraction of your workforce identity sprawl).\nYou aren't limited to the apps that you know about and manage centrally — you can observe every login that passes through the browser.\nYou can observe all the properties of a login, including the login method, MFA method, etc. You'd otherwise need API access to\nmaybe\nget this information (depending on whether an API is provided and whether this specific data can be interrogated, also not standard for many apps).\nIt's obvious with all that we've covered so far that fixing every identity vulnerability is an ominous task — the SaaS ecosystem itself is working against you.\nThis is why detecting and responding to identity attacks is essential.\nBecause identity compromise almost always involves phishing or social engineering a user to perform an action in their browser (with some exceptions — like the\nScattered Spider-related help desk attacks\nseen recently), it's also the perfect place to monitor for and intercept attacks.\nIn the browser, you gather deep, contextualized information about page behavior and user inputs that can be used to detect and shut down risky scenarios in real time. Take the example of phishing pages. Because Push operates in the browser, it sees everything:\nThe page layout\nWhere the user came from\nThe password they enter\n(as a salted, abbreviated hash)\nWhat scripts are running\nAnd where credentials are being sent\nBeing in the browser gives you unrivalled visibility of phishing page activity and user behavior.\nConclusion\nIdentity attacks are the biggest unsolved problem facing security teams today and the leading cause of security breaches. At the same time, the browser presents security teams with all the tools they need to prevent, detect, and respond to identity-based attacks — proactively by finding and fixing identity vulnerabilities, and reactively by detecting and blocking attacks against users in real time.\nOrganizations need to move past the old ways of doing identity security — relying on MFA attestations, identity management dashboards, and\nlegacy email and network anti-phishing tools\n. And there's no better place to stop these attacks than in the browser.\nFind out more\nPush Security's browser-based security platform provides comprehensive detection and response capabilities against the leading cause of breaches. Push blocks identity attacks like AiTM phishing, credential stuffing, password spraying and session hijacking using stolen session tokens. You can also use Push to find and fix identity vulnerabilities across the apps that your employees use, like ghost logins, SSO coverage gaps, MFA gaps, vulnerable passwords, risky OAuth integrations, and more.\nIf you want to learn more about how Push helps you to detect and stop attacks in the browser,\nbook some time with one of our team for a live demo\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nGoogle News\n,\nTwitter\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

Users in South Korea appear to be the primary focus.\n\"This extensive campaign involved over 250 malicious Android applications and more than 80 malicious domains, all disguised as legitimate dating and social media applications,\" security researcher Rajat Goyal\nsaid\n.\nThe bogus domains, which impersonate legitimate app store listing pages, are used as a lure to trick users into installing these apps, resulting in the exfiltration of contact lists and images, all while keeping up an illusion of legitimacy.\nOnce installed, the Android apps also prompt the victim to enter an invitation code, after which it's validated against a command-and-control (C2) server. The app then proceeds to request sensitive permissions that allow it access to SMS messages, contact lists, and files under the pretext of offering the advertised functionality.\nCoupling the activation of the malicious behavior to an invitation code is, by turns, clever and sneaky as it allows the malware to evade dynamic analyses and antivirus scans and silently hoover data.\nThe iOS version of the campaign has been found to entice users into installing a deceptive mobile configuration profile on their device, and then use the configuration to facilitate the app installation to capture contacts, photos, and the photo library.\nThe campaign is said to be in active development, with new variants of the malware samples limiting themselves to collecting contacts, images, and device information to an external server. There is also evidence that the threat actors behind the activity have resorted to blackmailing victims with threats to share personal videos with family members.\n\"This unsettling story is not an isolated incident; it highlights the psychological manipulation and social engineering tactics that these campaigns employ to take advantage of emotional vulnerability,\" Goyal said.\n\"Victims are enticed into installing malware with the promise of companionship, only to discover that they are caught in a cycle of surveillance, extortion, and humiliation.\"\nThe disclosure comes in the wake of another campaign that has set up 607 Chinese-language domains to distribute malicious application files (APKs) posing as the Telegram messaging app via a QR code embedded on the site and execute remote commands in real-time to enable data theft, surveillance, and control over the device using the\nMediaPlayer API\n.\n\"The APK was signed with a\nv1 signature scheme\n, making it vulnerable to the\nJanus vulnerability\non Android 5.0 – 8.0,\" BforeAI\nsaid\n. \"This\nvulnerability\nallows attackers to craft deceptive applications.\"\n\"After crafting the malicious application, it is then repackaged using its original v1 signature. This modification goes undetected, allowing the compromised app to be installed without causing suspicion. In essence, it enables attackers to make an app more dangerous, redistribute it as an APK, and trick users (especially on older devices) into installing it while completely bypassing security checks.\"\nMimicking trusted and popular online platforms has been a successful compromise vector, as evidenced by Android campaigns that are targeting Indian bank customers and Bengali-speaking users, particularly people from Bangladesh living in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, and the United Arab Emirates, with malicious apps posing as financial services distributed via phishing sites and Facebook pages.\nThe applications are designed to deceive users into entering their personal information as part of a supposed account creation process, as well as capture data provided by them in the fake transaction interfaces engineered to simulate mobile money transfers, bill payments, and bank transfers. In reality, no actual transaction is carried out.\n\"While the attack techniques are not new, the campaign's cultural targeting and sustained activity reflect how cybercriminals continue to adapt their strategies to reach specific communities,\" McAfee Labs researcher Dexter Shin\nsaid\n.\nThe malware disseminated by impersonating Indian banking services, for its part,\nleverages\nFirebase for C2 operations and utilizes phishing pages to mimic genuine user interfaces and harvest a wide range of data, including debit card details and SIM information. It also features call forwarding and remote calling functions.\nAnother Asian country that has become the target of Android malware attacks is Vietnam, where phishing sites posing as financial and government institutions are being used to propagate a new banking trojan dubbed RedHook.\n\"It communicates to the command-and-control (C2) server using WebSocket and supports over 30 remote commands, enabling complete control over compromised devices,\" Cyble\nsaid\n. \"Code artifacts, including Chinese-language strings, suggest development by a Chinese-speaking threat actor or group.\"\nA notable feature of the RedHook is its combination of keylogging and remote access trojan (RAT) capabilities to conduct credential theft and financial fraud. It also abuses Android's accessibility services to perform overlay attacks and leverages the\nMediaProjection API\nto capture screen content.\nAlthough the campaign is new, an exposed AWS S3 bucket used by the threat actor has uncovered uploaded screenshots, fake banking templates, PDF documents, and images detailing the malware's behavior dating back to November 27, 2024.\n\"The discovery of RedHook highlights the growing sophistication of Android banking trojans that combine phishing, remote access, and keylogging to carry out financial fraud,\" the company added. \"By leveraging legitimate Android APIs and abusing accessibility permissions, RedHook stealthily gains deep control over infected devices while remaining under the radar of many security solutions.\"\nMalicious Android APKs masquerading as popular brands and exploiting social engineering and off-market distribution channels have also been found to siphon data and hijack network traffic for monetization purposes, often with the end goal of simulating user activity to inflate ad metrics or redirect users through affiliate funnels for illicit revenue generation.\nBesides incorporating checks for sandboxed and virtualized environments, the apps feature a modular design to turn on advanced functionality at will.\n\"It leverages the open-source tool ApkSignatureKillerEx to subvert Android's native signature verification process, allowing the injection of a secondary payload (origin.apk) into the application's directory,\" Trustwave SpiderLabs\nsaid\n. \"This effectively reroutes execution to malicious code while preserving the app's appearance as a legitimate, properly signed package, both to the operating system and users.\"\nThe campaign has not been attributed to any known threat actor or group, although the use of ad fraud tactics suggests a possible connection to Chinese-speaking criminal groups.\nThat's not all. New research from iVerify has revealed that setting up new Android-focused campaigns can be as easy as renting a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) kit like PhantomOS or Nebula for a monthly subscription, further lowering the bar for cybercrime.\n\"Some of these kits come with features 2FA interception, the ability to bypass antivirus software, silent app installs, GPS tracking, and even phishing overlays that are specific to a brand,\" researcher Daniel Kelley\nsaid\n. \"The platforms come with everything they need, like support through Telegram, backend infrastructure, and built-in ways to get around Google Play Protect.\"\nAlso offered on underground forums are crypters and exploit kits that allow the malware to stay under the radar and spread the infections at scale using social engineering techniques. One such tool is Android ADB Scanner, which looks for open Android Debug Bridge (ADB) ports and pushes a malicious APK file without the victim's knowledge. The service is available for around $600-$750.\n\"Perhaps the most interesting development in this ecosystem is the commoditization of infected devices themselves,\" Kelley noted. \"So-called 'install' markets let cybercriminals buy access to already compromised Android devices in bulk.\"\nMarkets such as Valhalla offer devices compromised by banking trojans like ERMAC, Hook, Hydra, and Octo in a chosen country for a fee. This approach obviates the need for attackers to distribute malware or infect devices on their own. Instead, they can just acquire a network of existing bots to carry out activities of their choice.\nTo mitigate the risks posed by such apps, it's advised to remain cautious of apps requiring unusual permissions or invitation codes, avoid downloading apps from untrusted sources or unofficial app stores, and periodically review device permissions and installed profiles.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "React conquered XSS? Think again. That's the reality facing JavaScript developers in 2025, where attackers have quietly evolved their injection techniques to exploit everything from prototype pollution to AI-generated code, bypassing the very frameworks designed to keep applications secure.\nFull 47-page guide\nwith framework-specific defenses (PDF, free).\nJavaScript conquered the web, but with that victory came new battlefields. While developers embraced React, Vue, and Angular, attackers evolved their tactics, exploiting AI prompt injection, supply chain compromises, and prototype pollution in ways traditional security measures can't catch.\nA Wake-up Call: The Polyfill.io Attack\nIn June 2024, a single JavaScript injection attack compromised over 100,000 websites in the biggest JavaScript injection attack of the year. The\nPolyfill.io supply chain attack\n, where a Chinese company acquired a trusted JavaScript library and weaponized it to inject malicious code, affected major platforms including Hulu, Mercedes-Benz, and WarnerBros. This wasn't an isolated incident targeting vulnerable forms or outdated systems. This was a sophisticated injection that turned websites' own security tools against them, proving that traditional JavaScript defenses have become dangerously obsolete.\nThe Threat Landscape Has Changed\nGone are the days when a simple innerHTML sanitization could keep your app secure. Today's attackers are leveraging:\nSupply chain compromises\ntargeting your favorite npm packages\nPrototype pollution attacks\nthat can hijack your entire object model\nAI-driven prompt injections\nthat trick LLMs into generating malicious code\nDOM-based XSS in single-page applications\nthat bypass server-side protections\nThe numbers tell the story: 22,254 CVEs were reported by mid-2024, a\n30% jump\nfrom 2023 and 56% increase from 2022. With 98% of websites using JavaScript client-side and 67.9% of developers relying on it as their primary language, the attack surface has never been larger.\nWhat Makes This Different\nMost security guides still focus on decade-old attack patterns. This comprehensive analysis breaks down modern threats with a\ndefense-in-depth approach\nthat prioritizes protections by impact:\nFor real-world code samples and a prioritized roadmap,\nsee the full guide\nThe Framework Reality Check\nEven modern frameworks aren't bulletproof:\nThis React code looks safe but isn't –\n// 🚨 Vulnerable: unsanitized input\nBetter approach with proper sanitization -\n// ✅ Secure: React component with DOMPurify\nWhy it matters:\ndangerouslySetInnerHTML bypasses React's built-in XSS protection by directly injecting HTML into the DOM. When user content contains malicious scripts, they execute immediately in the victim's browser, potentially:\nStealing authentication cookies and session tokens\nPerforming actions on behalf of the user\nRedirecting to malicious sites\nKeylogging sensitive information\nDOMPurify sanitizes HTML by parsing the content and removing any potentially malicious elements while preserving safe formatting tags like <b>, <i>, <p>, etc.\nThe Banking Sector Under Siege\nThe financial industry has become prime target for sophisticated JavaScript injection attacks. In March 2023, IBM uncovered a\nmalware campaign\nthat targeted over 40 banks across the Americas, Europe, and Japan, compromising more than 50,000 individual user sessions. The attack leveraged advanced JavaScript web injections that detect specific page structures used by banking platforms, then dynamically inject malicious scripts to steal user credentials and one-time password tokens.\nWhat made this campaign particularly dangerous was its adaptive behavior, the malware constantly communicated with command-and-control servers, adjusting its tactics in real-time based on page states and security detection attempts. Using sophisticated\nobfuscation techniques\n, the malware could patch functions to remove traces of its presence and avoid execution when security products were detected, proving that traditional JavaScript defenses are no match for modern, dynamically evolving threats.\nThe Store Raw, Encode on Output Principle\nOne of the guide's most practical insights reinforces a fundamental security best practice: always store raw data and encode based on output context.\nThis approach:\nStore raw, unencoded data in your database\nApply context-specific encoding at render time based on where data appears\nUse different encoding methods for each output context (HTML entities for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JS contexts, URL encoding for URLs, CSS escaping for stylesheets)\nThis context-aware encoding approach prevents double-encoding issues, maintains data integrity, and ensures proper protection regardless of how the data is eventually displayed, something any TypeScript developer building robust domain models will appreciate. The key insight is that the same user input might need HTML encoding when displayed in a div, JavaScript escaping when used in a script tag, and URL encoding when used in a link parameter.\nWebAssembly Security Considerations\nWhile WebAssembly offers performance benefits and sandboxing, it's important to understand its security implications. The guide examines how Wasm introduces specific considerations that developers should be aware of:\nSource code vulnerabilities carry over\n: Memory-unsafe languages like C/C++ compiled to Wasm retain their original vulnerability patterns (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.)\nReduced transparency\n: The binary format makes security auditing more challenging compared to readable JavaScript source\nNovel attack surfaces\n: Side-channel attacks through timing analysis and potential VM escape vectors, though these remain largely theoretical\nWebAssembly's sandboxed execution model does provide strong isolation, but like any technology, it requires thoughtful implementation and shouldn't be viewed as an automatic security upgrade from JavaScript.\nEmerging AI Threats\nAs LLMs become integrated into web applications, a new attack vector has emerged:\nprompt injection attacks\n. Malicious users craft prompts that trick AI models into generating JavaScript code that executes on the client side, a completely new category of injection vulnerability. You can learn more about it in the full guide.\nThe Bottom Line\nModern JavaScript security isn't about implementing a checklist, it's about understanding how attackers think and building layered defenses that adapt to evolving threats. Whether you're building with React, Angular, or Vue, the fundamental principle remains:\nnever trust client-side code, always validate server-side, and encode based on context\n.\nThe complete guide provides implementation examples for all major frameworks, practical code samples, and a prioritized approach that helps teams tackle the most critical vulnerabilities first.\nDownload the full PDF playbook here\n.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nGoogle News\n,\nTwitter\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

Because the admin console typically runs on internal web servers, an exploited vulnerability here could give attackers an easy foothold into broader systems if overlooked.\nIn a potential attack scenario, a threat actor could leverage the flaw to target an admin user with a current login session, and deceive them into clicking on a specially crafted link that leads to unauthorized changes.\nIt's currently not known how the vulnerability is being exploited in real-world attacks. But given that shortcomings in the software solution have been abused by\nIranian nation-state actors\nas well as e-crime groups like\nBl00dy\n,\nCl0p, and LockBit\nransomware for initial access, it's essential that users apply necessary updates, if not already.\nAt the time of writing, no public proof-of-concept is available, but attackers could exploit the bug through a phishing email or a malicious site that tricks a logged-in admin into triggering the request. Mitigation requires more than patching—organizations should also review session timeouts, restrict admin access to known IPs, and enforce strong CSRF token validation.\nPursuant to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to update their instances to a patched version by August 18, 2025.\nAdmins should cross-check with MITRE ATT&CK techniques like T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) and T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) to align detection rules. For broader context, tracking PaperCut incidents in relation to ransomware entry points or initial access vectors can help shape long-term hardening strategies.\nFound this article interesting?

Its members then splintered into numerous other ransomware gangs.\nIn January 2023, the\nRoyal (Quantum) ransomware gang was launched\n, which was believed to be the direct successor to the notorious Conti operation.\nIn June 2023, after feeling pressure from law enforcement for the attack on\nthe City of Dallas, Texas\n, the Royal ransomware operation began\ntesting a new BlackSuit encryptor\n, eventually rebranding as BlackSuit.\nCisco Talos researchers believe the new Chaos ransomware is a rebrand of BlackSuit based on similarities in the encryption, ransom note structure, and the toolset used in the attacks.\nWhile the U.S. DOJ and FBI have not explicitly distinguished which Chaos group 'Hors' belonged to, BleepingComputer confirmed that the Bitcoin seizure is linked to the new Chaos operation.\nAs the BlackSuit ransomware operation had its dark web extortion sites\nseized by law enforcement last week\n, it's possible that the law enforcement investigation uncovered this cryptocurrency wallet as part of the operation.\nThe Board Report Deck CISOs Actually Use\nCISOs know that getting board buy-in starts with a clear, strategic view of how cloud security drives business value.\nThis free, editable board report deck helps security leaders present risk, impact, and priorities in clear business terms.

        "Link": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-attackers-are-still-phishing-phishing-resistant-authentication/",
        "Summary": "Think passkeys make you phishing-proof? Think again. Attackers are using downgrade attacks, device-code phishing, and OAuth tricks to sneak past modern MFA. See how Push Security shuts them down. [...]",
        "Date": "2025-07-29",
        "Content": "As awareness grows around many MFA methods being “phishable” (i.e. not phishing resistant), passwordless, FIDO2-based authentication methods (aka. passkeys) like YubiKeys, Okta FastPass, and Windows Hello are being increasingly advocated.\nThis is a good thing. The most commonly used MFA factors (like SMS codes, push notifications, and app-based OTP) are routinely bypassed, with modern reverse-proxy “Attacker-in-the-Middle” phishing kits the most common method (and the standard choice for phishing attacks today).\nThese work by intercepting the authenticated session created when a victim enters their password and completes an MFA check. To do this, the phishing website simply passes messages between the user and the real website — hence “Attacker-in-the-Middle”.\nIn contrast, passkey-based logins can’t be phished. Because passkey-based logins are domain-bound, trying to use a passkey for\nmicrosoft.com\non\nphishing.com\nsimply won’t generate the correct value to pass the authentication check, even when proxied using an AitM kit.\nBut attackers haven’t given up that easily. As passkeys become more popular, we’re seeing a number of techniques designed to downgrade or otherwise circumvent the authentication process to make it vulnerable to phishing attacks.\nSo, here’s all the techniques that attackers have used to get around passkeys (so far).\nDowngrade attacks\nDowngrade attacks\nare the go-to method used by attackers to get around phishing-resistant MFA. MFA downgrade functionality has been observed in a number of criminal AitM kits and is even possible using commodity kits like Evilginx.\nWhen conducting an Attacker-in-the-Middle phishing attack, the attacker doesn’t need to relay 100% of the messages accurately. Instead, they can alter some of them. The app might ask the user “You need to MFA — do you want to use your passkey, or your backup authenticator code?”, but the phishing website might modify this page to say “You need to MFA — use your backup authenticator code” not giving you the option to use your secure passkey. This is called a downgrade attack.\nThis can also be applied to accounts that use SSO as the default login method. In this scenario, the phish kit can select a backup username and password option to allow the phishing attack to proceed.\nHere’s an example of Evilginx with a custom phishlet to downgrade authentication for a Microsoft account using Windows Hello.\nSo, you have a situation where even if a phishing-resistant login method exists, the presence of a less secure backup method means the account is still vulnerable to phishing attacks.\nWant to learn more about MFA downgrade attacks and how to stop them?\nCheck out the latest blog post from Push Security to see MFA downgrade in action, real excerpts from criminal phishing kits.\nLearn more about how Push detects and blocks MFA downgrade attacks as they happen — in the victim’s browser.\nRead our Research\nDevice code phishing\nTo get around phishing-resistant authentication methods, attackers are also using\ndevice code phishing\nattacks that take advantage of alternative authentication flows for devices which do not support passkey-based logins, e.g. because they don’t have web browsers, or have limited input capabilities.\nThis alternative login flow operates by supplying a user with a unique code and instructing them to visit a webpage in a browser on a different device to enter the code in order to authorize the device.\nThis can be used by an adversary to conduct a phishing attack against a target by convincing them to visit their authentication provider website and enter a code supplied by the adversary, thereby granting access to their account.\nThis attack has the advantage of linking the target to a legitimate URL, with no prompt to consent to explicit permissions beyond entering the device code and signing in. Additionally, verified apps can be impersonated in some cases.\nThis technique has been observed in a number of recent campaigns, including repeated Russia-sponsored targeting of M365 accounts\n(1)\n(2)\n.\nConsent phishing\nConsent phishing\nwas one of the first techniques added to the\nSaaS attacks matrix\nand has been around for some time, but with a recent uptick in malicious activity.\nOAuth allows users to grant third-party apps permissions to access their data. Adversaries can abuse this functionality by tricking users into authorizing access for malicious OAuth apps.\nIn a consent phishing attack, an adversary sends a phishing link to a target that requests permissions to access sensitive data or permissions to perform dangerous actions. If the target grants consent for the permissions, the adversary gains that level of access over the target’s account. This level of access will bypass MFA and persist through password changes.\nConsent phishing is most commonly associated with attacks aimed at getting access to Microsoft Azure or Google Workspace tenants. However, it has become more common for SaaS apps to implement their own OAuth-authenticated APIs and app stores that can be targeted in the same way —\nas seen in this recent example targeting GitHub users\n.\nGitHub malicious OAuth app.\nOnce authorized, the attacker has extensive access to the account. In this example affecting GitHub, the attacker would be able to modify repositories to conduct further attacks against users (e.g. by infecting them with malware), poison the repos and services connected to the repository, and exfiltrate any sensitive data the account has access to.\nVerification phishing\nEmail verification is sometimes used as a control, such as when registering new accounts. This is typically implemented by emailing the target user with either a clickable link for them to verify or a verification code that they need to enter.\nVerification phishing\nis when an adversary uses phishing, or some other type of social engineering, to convince a user to click a verification link or pass them the verification code in order to defeat this control.\nAn example of this technique being used to bypass MFA is with\ncross-IdP impersonation\n. This is where an attacker simply registers a new IdP account to the victim’s corporate email domain. In many cases, this allows you to log in via SSO using the new IdP without any further checks — in fact, 3 in 5 apps were found to allow this behavior.\nWhen you consider the large number of apps that can function as an IdP for the purposes of SSO, there are quite a few possible targets (depending on the app, and the login methods it supports).\nManaged IdPs can be administered centrally by the organization (which owns and operates the IdP and the identities on it), whereas unmanaged ‘social’ IdPs are controlled by the vendor, and identities are owned and administered by the user.\nYou can see an example of this in the video below, or\nread an analysis of two in-the-wild examples here\n.\nApp-specific password phishing\nApp-Specific password phishing\nis a social engineering technique where an adversary tricks a user into generating an \"app-specific password\" for their account and then sharing it with the attacker. These legacy passwords are a feature in some major SaaS providers (like Google and Apple) designed to allow older applications that do not support modern authentication (like OAuth 2.0) to access account data.\nThe attack flow typically involves a pretext where the attacker, posing as a trusted entity (e.g., tech support, a service provider), directs the user to their account's security settings. The user is then guided through the process of creating a new app-specific password and is instructed to paste this password into a form or chat window controlled by the attacker.\nBecause app-specific passwords are designed for use in environments that do not support MFA, once the attacker possesses this password, they can gain persistent, programmatic access to the user's account data (e.g., emails, contacts, files) via APIs, often without triggering the same level of security alerts as a traditional interactive login from an unrecognized device.\nThis makes the access stealthier and more durable than a session token, as these passwords typically remain valid until manually revoked by the user.\nA recent example of this was disclosed\nwhere an expert on Russian information operations was targeted with a sophisticated and personalized social engineering attack, where the attacker was able to establish persistent access to the victim’s mailbox using ASPs by logging into a mail client.\nThis involved a sophisticated lure impersonating the US Department of State instructing the victim on how to create and share an ASP with the attacker, granting access to their Google mailbox.\nA highly convincing ASP phishing lure used in a targeted attack.\nBonus: Targeting local accounts not using passkeys\nPossibly the easiest way to get around passkeys, though, is to target apps that don’t support passkeys natively. Passkeys are typically used in combination with SSO, where you log into your primary IdP provider with a secure, passkey-protected login, and then on to connected apps via SSO. Many apps do not allow passkey logins directly.\nAs a result, apps like Slack, Mailchimp, Postman, GitHub, and other commonly-used business apps are being increasingly targeted directly — bypassing IdPs (MS, Google, Okta, etc.) that typically have more robust authentication controls in place.\nJust like backup MFA methods are often registered alongside passkeys, local\n“ghost login”\nmethods are often registered alongside SSO, meaning that accounts have multiple possible entry points.\nIn many cases, they don’t have MFA deployed at all — making them equally susceptible to attacks using stolen credentials (as seen in the\nSnowflake\nattacks last year, and\nJira\nattacks this year).\nThis results in a\nvast and vulnerable identity attack surface\nfor organizations to manage.\nA 1,000 user organization has over 15,000 accounts with various configurations and associated vulnerabilities.\nConclusion\nMost of the time, attackers don’t have to do anything different to get around passkeys. Simply using the same phishing tools and techniques they usually apply will get the job done in the likely event that a backup, non-passkey MFA method is registered to the account.\nThe only accounts that are truly secure are those with only passkeys, and no backup methods OR conditional access policies preventing non-passkey authentication.\nBut the devil is in the detail here too (such as\nthis recent example\nof Microsoft-provided CA templates setting “risky” sign-ins as false positives and allowing them to proceed).\nAnd auditing your app and identity sprawl is no mean feat when you consider the varying levels of visibility and control available to security teams per app (and the fact that many apps are simply not centrally adopted or known to begin with).\nPrevent and intercept phishing attacks with Push Security\nDowngrade attacks using AitM phishing kits make up the vast majority of passkey-bypassing phishing attacks.\nPush Security’s browser-based security platform provides comprehensive identity attack detection and response capabilities against techniques like AitM phishing, credential stuffing, password spraying and session hijacking using stolen session tokens.\nYou can also use Push to find and fix identity vulnerabilities across every app that your employees use, like: ghost logins; SSO coverage gaps; MFA gaps; weak, breached and reused passwords; risky OAuth integrations; and more.\nIf you want to learn more about how Push helps you to detect and defeat common identity attack techniques,\nbook some time with one of our team for a live demo\n.\nSponsored and written by\nPush Security\n."

        "Date": "2025-07-29",
        "Content": "The connected sex toy platform Lovense is vulnerable to a zero-day flaw that allows an attacker to get access to a member's email address simply by knowing their username, putting them at risk of doxxing and harassment.\nLovense is an interactive sex toy manufacturer, best known for producing app-controlled sex toys with names like the Lush, the Gush, and, perhaps most boldly, the Kraken. The company claims to have 20 million customers worldwide.\nWhile Lovense toys are commonly used for both local and long-distance entertainment, they are also popular among cam models who allow viewers to tip or subscribe for remote control of their toys.\nHowever, the connected experience can also expose their Lovense username, and due to this flaw, potentially reveal their private email address.\nLovense usernames are often publicly shared on forums and social media, making them easy targets for attackers.\nThe flaw was discovered by security researcher BobDaHacker, who collaborated with researchers Eva and Rebane to reverse engineer the app and automate the attack.\nThe researchers disclosed two flaws over four months ago, on March 26, 2025. However, only one of the flaws, a critical account hijacking flaw, was subsequently fixed.\nThe Lovense flaws\nThe vulnerability stems from the interaction between Lovense's XMPP chat system, used for communication between users, and the platform's backend.\n\"So it all started when I was using the Lovense app and muted someone. That's it. Just muted them,\" explains\nBobDaHacker's report\n.\n\"But then I saw the API response and was like... wait, is that an email address? Why is that there? After digging deeper, I figured out how to turn any username into their email address.\"\nTo exploit the flaw, an attacker makes a POST request to the\n/api/wear/genGtoken\nAPI endpoint with their credentials, which returns a gtoken (authentication token) and AES-CBC encryption keys.\nThe attacker then takes any publicly known Lovense username and encrypts it using the retrieved encryption keys. This encrypted payload is sent to the\n/app/ajaxCheckEmailOrUserIdRegisted?email={encrypted_username}\nAPI endpoint.\nThe server responds with data containing a fake email address, which the researcher converted into a fake Jabber ID (JID) used by Lovense's XMPP server.\nBy adding this fake JID to their XMPP contact list and sending a presence subscription over XMPP (similar to a friend request), the attacker can refresh the roster (contact list), which now includes both the fake JID and the real one associated with the target's account.\nHowever, the problem is that the real JID is constructed using the user's actual email, in the format username!!!domain.com_w@im.lovense.com, allowing attackers to extract the victim's email address.\nFor example, if it returned bleeping!!!example.com_w@im.lovense.com, the resulting actual email of the Lovense account is bleeping@example.com.\nThe researchers confirmed that the entire process can be completed in less than one second per user with a script. BleepingComputer created a fake account today and shared our username with BobDaHacker, allowing them to simply connect as a friend and return the email we registered with.\nThe researcher also stated that it's not necessary to accept a friend request to exploit the flaw.\nBleepingComputer also confirmed that it is relatively easy to find legitimate usernames on forums and Lovense-related sites, like lovenselife.com.\nThe researcher also claims that the FanBerry extension, created by Lovense, can be used to harvest usernames as many of the cam models use the same username, making wide-scale email harvesting possible.\nThe researchers also discovered a critical vulnerability that let them completely hijack an account.\nUsing only an email address, an attacker could generate authentication tokens without needing a password. Using these tokens, an attacker could impersonate a user on Lovense platforms, including Lovense Connect, StreamMaster, and Cam101.\nThese tokens reportedly worked on admin accounts as well.\nWhile Lovense has mitigated this flaw by rejecting the tokens on its APIs, the researchers noted that gtokens can still be generated without a password.\nBoth issues were reported to Lovense on March 26, 2025. In April, after also submitting the bugs on HackerOne, Lovense informed the researchers that the email issue was already known and fixed in an upcoming version.\nThe company initially downplayed the account hijacking flaw, but after being told it could allow full admin account access, Lovense reclassified it as critical.\nIn total, the researchers received $3,000 for the disclosure of the flaws.\nOn June 4, the company claimed the flaws were fixed, but the researchers confirmed this was not the case. Lovense ultimately fixed the account hijack flaw in July but stated that it would take approximately 14 months to resolve the email flaw, as it would break compatibility with older versions of their app.\n\"We've launched a long-term remediation plan that will take approximately ten months, with at least four more months required to fully implement a complete solution,\" Lovense told the researcher.\n\"We also evaluated a faster, one-month fix. However, it would require forcing all users to upgrade immediately, which would disrupt support for legacy versions. We've decided against this approach in favor of a more stable and user-friendly solution.\"\nThe researchers criticized this response, stating the company repeatedly claimed the issues were fixed when they were not.\n\"Your users deserve better. Stop putting old app support over security. Actually fix things. And test your fixes before saying they work,\" BobDaHacker wrote in the report.\nUltimately, Lovense says they deployed a proxy feature on July 3rd that was suggested by the researchers to mitigate the attack. However, even after doing a force update of the app, the flaw was not fixed, so its unclear what was changed.\nIn 2016,\nmultiple Lovense flaws\nexposed email addresses or allowed attackers to determine if an email address had an account at Lovense.\nAfter the publishing of this story, BobDaHacker was told that other researchers named\n@Krissy\nand\n@SkeletalDemise\ndiscovered the same account takeover bug in 2023, which was disclosed through HackerOne.\nHowever, Lovense allegedly marked the flaw as fixed when it was not, changing the severity from high to medium, and only paying out a $350 bug bounty for the disclosure.\nThe researchers also found another API, /api/getUserNameByEmailV2, that allowed you to convert a username to an email address or vice-versa, without having to utilize XMPP.\nThis API was allegedly patched and stopped working after the disclosure, without alerting the researcher.\nUpdate 7/29/25 10:51 AM ET:\nIn a statement to BleepingComputer, Lovense thanked BobDaHacker for disclosing the flaws and said that a fix is rolling out in the app stores.\n\"We are pleased to inform you that the update addressing the latest vulnerabilities, as referenced by the researcher in his/her blog post last night, was already submitted to app stores before the post was published,\" Lovense told BleepingComputer.\n\"The full update is expected to be pushed to all users within the next week. Once all users have updated to the new version and we disable older versions, this issue will be completely resolved.\"\nHowever, the spokesperson also stated that the flaw that exposed email addresses was fixed at the end of June. This statement conflicts with how the researcher demonstrated to BleepingComputer yesterday that they could retrieve our email address for our test account simply by accepting their friend request.\nBleepingComputer sent follow-up questions to Lovense about the flaw still working and will update our story with any reply.\nCloud Detection & Response for Dummies\nContain emerging threats in real time - before they impact your business.\nLearn how cloud detection and response (CDR) gives security teams the edge they need in this practical, no-nonsense guide.\nGet the Guide\nRelated Articles:\nVMware fixes four ESXi zero-day bugs exploited at Pwn2Own Berlin\nRuckus Networks leaves severe flaws unpatched in management devices\nMicrosoft July 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes one zero-day, 137 flaws\nApple fixes two zero-days exploited in targeted iPhone attacks\nHackers exploited Windows WebDav zero-day to drop malware"

The company, which operates a vast network of hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic laboratories, is a key player in the Polish healthcare system, serving a large number of patients.

The post alleges that the compromised accounts provide access to a wealth of sensitive patient information and highlights a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the accounts, making them more vulnerable to unauthorized access. The exposed credentials allegedly allow access to the following:\nPersonal medical records\nAppointment history\nLaboratory results\nThe data was allegedly shared in a plain text format containing URLs, logins, and passwords for the patient accounts. While the initial sample is small, it suggests a potentially larger dataset may be compromised.

The seller has set an asking price between $2,000 and $2,500 for this highly privileged access.\nThe gravity of this alleged breach is highlighted by the level of access being sold. The threat actor claims to provide full ‘Domain Admin’ privileges, which would give a buyer complete and unrestricted control over the company’s entire IT infrastructure. This “keys to the kingdom” level of access is reportedly available through a combination of VPN and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), indicating a potential compromise of the company’s remote work infrastructure.\nThis incident is a classic example of the work of an Initial Access Broker (IAB), a type of cybercriminal who specializes in infiltrating corporate networks and then selling that access to other malicious parties. The buyers are often ransomware gangs who use the access to deploy their malware and extort the victim. While the targeted company has not been identified, the sale of such high-level access poses a severe and imminent threat of a major cyberattack, such as a devastating ransomware incident or large-scale data theft.\nTags:\ncyberattack\nCyberSecurity\ndark web\nIndia\nInitial Access Broker\nRDP\nVPN"

Tea, which boasts over 1.6 million users and recently topped app store charts, is designed as a space for women to confidentially share information about men to enhance their safety. This new incident follows a breach reported just last week that exposed user selfies and ID photos. This latest exposure, however, is far more alarming as it allegedly involves recent, private conversations, directly contradicting the company’s initial claims that only legacy data was affected.\nAn independent security researcher discovered the vulnerability, which reportedly allowed access to a database containing over a million user messages from early 2023 until as recently as last week. The exposed communications are of an extremely sensitive nature, potentially putting users at significant risk of blackmail, harassment, or real-world harm. While the app encourages anonymous usernames, the content of the messages often contained personally identifiable information that could easily unmask the users. The allegedly leaked data includes:\nPrivate messages between users discovering they were dating the same person.\nDiscussions between women about their abortions.\nConversations where users shared phone numbers and other contact details.\nChats where women identified cheating partners.\nThis second security failure compounds the fallout from the first breach, where user selfies and driver’s license photos were leaked from an exposed database. That data was maliciously used to create a website that pitted users’ photos against each other in a “hot or not” style ranking.
