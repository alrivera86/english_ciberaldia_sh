        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a mobile forensics tool called\nMassistant\nthat's used by law enforcement authorities in China to gather information from seized mobile devices.\nThe hacking tool, believed to be a successor of\nMFSocket\n, is developed by a Chinese company named\nSDIC Intelligence Xiamen Information Co., Ltd.\n, which was formerly known as Meiya Pico. It\nspecializes\nin the research, development, and sale of electronic data forensics and network information security technology products.\nAccording to a report published by Lookout, Massistant works in conjunction with a corresponding desktop software, allowing for access to the device's GPS location data, SMS messages, images, audio, contacts, and phone services.\n\"Meiya Pico maintains partnerships with domestic and international law enforcement partners, both as a surveillance hardware and software provider, as well as through training programs for law enforcement personnel,\" security researcher Kristina Balaam\nsaid\n.\nMassistant requires physical access to the device in order to install the application, meaning it can be used to collect data from confiscated devices from individuals when stopped at border checkpoints.\nLookout said it obtained Massistant samples between mid-2019 and early 2023 and that they were signed with an Android signing certificate referencing Meiya Pico.\nBoth Massistant and its predecessor,\nMFSocket\n, work similarly in that they need to be connected to a desktop computer running forensics software to extract the data from the device. Once launched on the phone, the tool prompts the users to grant it permissions to access sensitive data, after which no further interaction is required.\n\"If the user attempts to exit the application they receive a notice that the application is in 'get data' mode and exiting would result in some error,\" Balaam explained. \"This message is translated to only two languages: Chinese (Simplified characters) and 'US' English.\"\nThe application is designed such that it's automatically uninstalled from the device when it is disconnected from a USB. Massistant also expands on MFSocket's features by including the ability to connect to a phone using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) over Wi-Fi and to download additional files to the device.\nAnother new functionality incorporated into Massistant is to collect data from third-party messaging apps beyond Telegram to include Signal and Letstalk, a Taiwanese chat application with more than 100,000 downloads on Android.\nWhile Lookout's analysis focuses mainly on the Android version of Massistant, images shared on its website\nshow\niPhones connected to its forensic hardware device, suggesting that there is an iOS equivalent to pull data from Apple devices.\nThe fact that Meiya Pico may also be focused on iOS devices stems from the\nvarious patents\nfiled by the company related to gathering evidence from Android and iOS devices, including voiceprints for internet-related cases.\n\"Voiceprint features are one of the important biological features of the human body, and can uniquely determine the identity of a user,\"\naccording\nto one patent. \"After the voiceprint library is built, a plurality of police seeds can be directly served, and the efficiency and the capability of detecting and solving a case of a related organization can be effectively improved.\"\nThe digital forensics firm's involvement in the\nsurveillance space\nis not new. In December 2017, The Wall Street Journal\nreported\nthat the company worked with police officials in Ürümqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwestern China, to scan smartphones for terrorism-related content by plugging them into a handheld device.\nFour years later, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\nsanctioned\nMeiya Pico for enabling the \"biometric surveillance and tracking of ethnic and religious minorities in China, particularly the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang.\"\n\"Travel to and within mainland China carries with it the potential for tourists, business travelers, and persons of interest to have their confidential mobile data acquired as part of lawful intercept initiatives by state police,\" Lookout said.\nThe disclosure comes a couple of months after Lookout unearthed another spyware called\nEagleMsgSpy\nthat's suspected to be used by Chinese police departments as a lawful intercept tool to gather a wide range of information from mobile devices.\nFound this article interesting?

INET RAT is assessed to be a modified version of Shadow RAT, whereas the Blister DLL implant functions as a shellcode loader, eventually paving the way for a reverse-shell based implant.\nThe exact origins of the threat actor remain unclear, but evidence points to it being an espionage-focused group from Southeast Asia.\n\"UNG0002 represents a sophisticated and persistent threat entity from South Asia that has maintained consistent operations targeting multiple Asian jurisdictions since at least May 2024,\" Singha said. \"The group demonstrates high adaptability and technical proficiency, continuously evolving their toolset while maintaining consistent tactics, techniques, and procedures.\"\nFound this article interesting?

It was addressed by Ivanti in early January 2025. CVE-2025-22457, patched in April 2025, concerns a stack-based buffer overflow that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.\nWhile both vulnerabilities have been weaponized in the wild as zero-days, previous findings from JPCERT/CC in April have revealed that the first of the two issues had been abused to deliver malware families like\nSPAWNCHIMERA\nand\nDslogdRAT\n.\nThe latest analysis of the attacks involving ICS vulnerabilities has unearthed the use of DLL side-loading techniques to launch MDifyLoader that includes an encoded Cobalt Strike beacon payload. The beacon has been identified as version 4.5, which was\nreleased\nin December 2021.\n\"MDifyLoader is a loader created based on the open-source project\nlibPeConv\n,\" JPCERT/CC researcher Yuma Masubuchi\nsaid\n. \"MDifyLoader then loads an encrypted data file, decodes Cobalt Strike Beacon, and runs it on memory.\"\nAlso put to use is a Go-based remote access tool named VShell and another open-source network scanning utility written in Go called\nFscan\n. It's worth noting that both programs have been\nadopted\nby\nvarious\nChinese hacking groups\nin recent months.\nThe execution flow of Fscan\nFscan has been found to be executed by means of a loader, which, in turn, is launched using DLL side-loading. The rogue DLL loader is based on the open-source tool\nFilelessRemotePE\n.\n\"The used VShell has a function to check whether the system language is set to Chinese,\" JPCERT/CC said. \"The attackers repeatedly failed to execute VShell, and it was confirmed that each time they had installed a new version and attempted execution again. This behavior suggests that the language-checking function, likely intended for internal testing, was left enabled during deployment.\"\nUpon gaining a foothold into the internal network, the attackers are said to have carried out brute-force attacks against FTP, MS-SQL, and SSH servers and leveraged the\nEternalBlue SMB exploit\n(MS17-010) in an attempt to extract credentials and laterally move across the network.\n\"The attackers created new domain accounts and added them to existing groups, allowing them to retain access even if previously acquired credentials were revoked,\" Masubuchi said.\n\"These accounts blend in with normal operations, enabling long-term access to the internal network. Additionally, the attackers registered their malware as a service or a task scheduler to maintain persistence, ensuring it would run at system startup or upon specific event triggers.\"\nFound this article interesting?

It has been addressed by the GPU maker in versions 1.17.8 and 25.3.1, respectively.\nThe NVIDIA Container Toolkit refers to a collection of libraries and utilities that enable users to build and run GPU-accelerated Docker containers. The NVIDIA GPU Operator is designed to deploy these containers automatically on GPU nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.\nWiz, which shared details of the flaw in a Thursday analysis, said the shortcoming affects 37% of cloud environments, allowing an attacker to potentially access, steal, or manipulate the sensitive data and proprietary models of all other customers running on the same shared hardware by means of a three-line exploit.\nThe vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in how the toolkit handles the Open Container Initiative (OCI) hook \"createContainer.\" A successful exploit for CVE-2025-23266 can result in a complete takeover of the server. Wiz also characterized the flaw as \"incredibly\" easy to weaponize.\n\"By setting LD_PRELOAD in their Dockerfile, an attacker could instruct the nvidia-ctk hook to load a malicious library,\" Wiz researchers Nir Ohfeld and Shir Tamari\nadded\n.\n\"Making matters worse, the createContainer hook executes with its working directory set to the container's root filesystem. This means the malicious library can be loaded directly from the container image with a simple path, completing the exploit chain.\"\nAll of this can be achieved with a \"stunningly simple three-line Dockerfile\" that loads the attacker's shared object file into a privileged process, resulting in a container escape.\nThe disclosure comes a couple of months after Wiz\ndetailed\na bypass for another vulnerability in NVIDIA Container Toolkit (CVE-2024-0132, CVSS score: 9.0 and CVE-2025-23359, CVSS score: 8.3) that could have been abused to achieve complete host takeover.\n\"While the hype around AI security risks tends to focus on futuristic, AI-based attacks, 'old-school' infrastructure vulnerabilities in the ever-growing AI tech stack remain the immediate threat that security teams should prioritize,\" Wiz said.\n\"Additionally, this research highlights, not for the first time, that containers are not a strong security barrier and should not be relied upon as the sole means of isolation. When designing applications, especially for multi-tenant environments, one should always 'assume a vulnerability' and implement at least one strong isolation barrier, such as virtualization.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The vast majority of BADBOX infections have been reported in Brazil, the United States, Mexico , and Argentina.\nWhile early iterations of the malware were propagated via supply chain compromises that backdoored the IoT devices with malware prior to purchase, the attack chains have since adapted to allow infections to spread via malicious apps downloaded from unofficial marketplaces.\nMore than 10 million devices are estimated to have been roped into the botnet, allowing its operators to sell access to compromised home networks to facilitate various kinds of illicit activity by other threat actors.\nIn a\ncomplaint\nfiled on July 11, 2025, Google alleged that the BADBOX enterprise comprises multiple groups, each of which are responsible for different aspects of the criminal infrastructure -\nThe Infrastructure Group, which established and manages BADBOX 2.0's primary command-and-control (C2) infrastructure\nThe Backdoor Malware Group, which develops and pre-installs backdoor malware in the bots\nThe Evil Twin Group, which are behind an ad fraud campaign that\ncreates \"evil twin\" versions\nof legitimate apps available on Google Play Store to serve ads and launch hidden web browsers that load hidden ads\nThe Ad Games Group, which uses fraudulent \"games\" to generate ads\nThe company also accused BADBOX 2.0 actors of creating publisher accounts on the Google Ad Network to offer ad space on their apps or websites, for which they are compensated by Google.\n\"The sole purpose of the Enterprise's apps and websites is to provide ad space for BADBOX 2.0 bots to generate traffic,\" Google said. \"The Enterprise will deploy BADBOX 2.0 bots to 'view' those ads, generating numerous impressions of the ad. Google pays the BADBOX 2.0 Enterprise [...] for those impressions.\"\nFurthermore, Google pointed out the illegal operation allows the threat actors to profit from ad fraud on its network in three different ways: Using seemingly legitimate apps to stealthily load hidden ads via the \"evil twin\" scheme, opening hidden web browsers and interacting with ads on game websites created by them, and leveraging infected devices to conduct click fraud.\n\"The court has issued a preliminary injunction, i.e. has mandated that the BADBOX 2.0 Enterprise immediately stop their botnet operations and associated criminal schemes globally, and has compelled third-party internet service providers and domain registries to actively assist in dismantling the botnet's infrastructure, for instance, by blocking traffic to and from specified domains,\" Google\nsaid\n.\nIn a statement shared with The Hacker News, Stu Solomon, CEO of HUMAN Security, welcomed Google's action against the threat actors behind BADBOX 2.0, stating the effort exemplifies the power of collaborating against such threats.\n\"This takedown marks a significant step forward in the ongoing battle to secure the internet from sophisticated fraud operations that hijack devices, steal money, and exploit consumers without their knowledge,\" Solomon added.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "With IT outages and disruptions escalating, IT teams are shifting their focus beyond simply backing up data to maintaining operations during an incident. One of the key drivers behind this shift is the growing threat of ransomware, which continues to evolve in both frequency and complexity. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) platforms have made it possible for even inexperienced threat actors with less or no technical expertise to launch large-scale, damaging attacks. And these attacks don't just encrypt data now. They exfiltrate sensitive information for double and triple extortion, alter or delete backups, and disable recovery infrastructure to block restoration efforts.\nThis is especially critical for small and midsize businesses (SMBs), which are increasingly targeted due to their leaner defenses. For an SMB generating $10 million in annual revenue,\neven a single day of downtime can cost $55,076\n, without factoring in the long-term impact on customer trust and brand reputation. While also considering the mounting pressure to meet compliance mandates, tightening regulations in sectors like finance and healthcare, and the evolving standards set by cyber insurance providers, it's no longer enough to simply back up critical data. Organizations need a cyber resilience strategy that enables them to maintain operations even during major disruptions.\nLet's examine where traditional backup strategies fall short and how SMBs can build true cyber resilience to keep their businesses running when it matters most.\nWhy traditional backups are necessary but no longer sufficient\nFor years, backup strategies have followed a familiar playbook: periodic snapshots of critical systems, defined recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO), off-site replication and an occasional test restore. It's a setup that's served many IT teams well — after all, if restoring a lost file worked the last time, why wouldn't it work again?\nHowever, here's the problem: that thinking is rooted in a time when failures were usually accidental — caused by hardware faults, human error or software issues. It doesn't account for today's reality: targeted, persistent cyberattacks that are designed specifically to destroy your ability to recover.\nAttackers now routinely wipe or corrupt local backups, compromise admin credentials to gain control of backup systems and disable recovery infrastructure entirely. Many use double and triple extortion tactics, encrypting data, exfiltrating it and threatening to leak it publicly. Worse, the risk doesn't stop within your own perimeter.\nMany ransomware campaigns now target supply chains to disrupt multiple organizations at once. As an IT leader, it's essential to recognize the operational risks introduced by third-party vendors in your supply chain. Consider asking:\nHow you plan to extend cyber resilience expectations to vendors and partners\nWhat contractual clauses (such as HITRUST in healthcare) actually give you confidence in their backup and disaster recovery readiness\nFrame the situation in terms of risk appetite.\nWould your board tolerate a scenario where your backups were encrypted by ransomware? Ask the hard questions:\nAre we willing to accept a three-day infrastructure rebuild just to restore from legacy backups?\nAre we comfortable with a recovery that could take weeks, risking data loss due to untested systems?\nCan we prove to auditors — and cyber insurers — that we can restore operations within the documented window?\nIf the answer is \"no\" to any of these, then it's time to rethink your approach to business continuity and resilience.\nWhat is cyber resilience & why it's a strategic shift\nBackup focuses on copying data and restoring it later. However, cyber resilience goes one step further and keeps your business running even during an attack.\nA resilient cyber posture integrates:\nImmutable backups that are stored off-site in the cloud. These backups can't be modified or deleted by ransomware, unlike local systems that may be compromised if admin credentials are breached.\nAutomated, verified recovery testing to ensure your systems can actually restore under pressure. An untested backup is only a theory, not a plan.\nOrchestrated recovery playbooks that rebuild entire services and applications, not just files. Solutions like Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service (DRaaS) help streamline this, enabling faster, more reliable business service restoration.\nFig 1: Why cyber resilience is important for IT\nBefore taking a decision, also consider the budget vs. risk conversation: What costs your organization more — a week-long outage that stalls production, delays payroll or halts customer transactions, or investing in tooling that prevents it entirely?\nCyber resilience reduces both the likelihood of severe disruption and the impact when it occurs. Insurance may cover losses after the fact, but resilience ensures the business can still operate while the threat unfolds.\nHow to build a resilience-first strategy that protects your business operations\nAchieving cyber resilience demands a framework that connects IT readiness with business continuity. Here's how IT leaders can start building a resilience-first posture that aligns with operational priorities and board-level expectations:\n1. Start with a business impact lens\nBegin with a business impact analysis (BIA) to map IT systems to the functions they support. Not every system carries the same weight, but your enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), e-commerce platforms and scheduling systems might be mission-critical. Identify:\nWhich systems are essential to revenue and service delivery?\nWhat is the financial and reputational cost of each hour of downtime?\nThis isn't just about RTO and RPO; it's about knowing which business services must stay online to prevent cascading disruptions.\n2. Layer defenses around critical recovery infrastructure\nYour backup and recovery systems must be protected like production workloads — or better.\nEnforce multifactor authentication (MFA) and use separate admin credentials for backup consoles.\nChoose solutions that can detect ransomware activity early within backup environments.\nImplement immutable backups and store them off-site, in the cloud, to reduce risk from both ransomware and physical threats.\nMonitor logs and alerts for abnormal behavior. Early visibility buys valuable time during a breach.\n3. Automate backup verification and testing\nA backup that hasn't been tested is unreliable. Confidence in your recovery plan should come from proof, not assumptions. Automate verification to ensure the recoverability of not just files but also full application-level services.\nIncorporate:\nAutomated backup testing to validate integrity.\nOrchestrated DR runbook testing to simulate full recovery workflows.\n4. Develop and document recovery playbooks\nYour recovery strategy should be step-by-step, clear and role-specific.\nDefine who restores what, in what order and where.\nInclude guidance for reconnecting staff to systems and resuming operations.\nTrain non-technical teams to respond appropriately.\nFor example, if your retail POS goes down, how do store teams inform customers and process orders without eroding trust? Don't overlook crisis communications. Prepare your PR and leadership teams with clear internal and external messaging protocols. Silence and confusion create lasting damage.\nPro tip: Prepare a board-level resilience scorecard\nIT leaders should be ready to brief executives with metrics that matter. Create a one-page resilience scorecard that includes:\nRecovery time estimates for key systems.\nDates of last successful recovery tests.\nEvidence of test results and improvements.\nThis becomes your conversation starter with board members, compliance auditors and cyber insurers — turning technical readiness into strategic credibility.\nInsurance and audit readiness: Turning resilience into ROI\nCyber resilience is a key lever in managing financial risk. Today's insurers and auditors demand clear evidence of preparedness before offering coverage or approving claims.\nExpect questions like:\nDo you have immutable backups?\nHow often are restores tested — with proof?\nIs backup infrastructure segmented from production?\nAre cloud systems backed up independently?\nWhat are your actual RTOs and RPOs?\nFig 2: Example of a questionnaire in a cyber insurance application form\nBeing able to show documented proof — like logs, test reports, coverage maps or screenshots — can help reduce premiums and ensure claims align with your policy terms.\nThis is also a strategic conversation with your CFO: \"Investments in resilience don't just mitigate risk; they protect our ability to recover financially and unlock insurance value.\"\nHow modern platforms like Datto power the resilience stack\nBuilding a resilience-first posture doesn't have to mean stitching together multiple tools.

        "Content": "CrushFTP is warning that threat actors are actively exploiting a zero-day vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-54309, which allows attackers to gain administrative access via the web interface on vulnerable servers.\nCrushFTP is an enterprise file transfer server used by organizations to securely share and manage files over FTP, SFTP, HTTP/S, and other protocols.\nAccording to CrushFTP, threat actors were first detected exploiting the vulnerability on July 18th at 9AM CST, though it may have begun in the early hours of the previous day.\nCrushFTP CEO Ben Spink told BleepingComputer that they had previously fixed a vulnerability related to AS2 in HTTP(S) that inadvertantly blocked this zero-day flaw as well.\n\"A prior fix by chance happened to block this vulnerability too, but the prior fix was targeting a different issue and turning off some rarely used feature by default,\" Spink told BleepingComputer.\nCrushFTP says it believes threat actors reverse engineered their software and discovered this new bug and had begun exploiting it on devices that are not up-to-date on their patches.\n\"We believe this bug was in builds prior to July 1st time period roughly...the latest versions of CrushFTP already have the issue patched,\" reads\nCrushFTP's advisory\n.\n\"The attack vector was HTTP(S) for how they could exploit the server. We had fixed a different issue related to AS2 in HTTP(S) not realizing that prior bug could be used like this exploit was. Hackers apparently saw our code change, and figured out a way to exploit the prior bug.\n\"As always we recommend regularly and frequent patching. Anyone who had kept up to date was spared from this exploit.\"\nThe attack occurs via the software's web interface in versions prior to CrushFTP v10.8.5 and CrushFTP v11.3.4_23. It is unclear when these versions were released, but CrushFTP says around July 1st.\nCrushFTP stresses that systems that have been kept up to date are not vulnerable.\nEnterprise customers using a DMZ CrushFTP instance to isolate their main server are not believed to be affected by this vulnerability.\nAdministrators who believe their systems were compromised are advised to restore the default user configuration from a backup dated before July 16th. Indicators of compromise include:\nUnexpected entries in MainUsers/default/user.XML, especially recent modifications or a\nlast_logins\nfield\nNew, unrecognized admin-level usernames such as\n7a0d26089ac528941bf8cb998d97f408m\n.\nSpink says that they are most commonly seeing the default user modified as the main IOC.\n\"In general we have seen the default user modified as the main IOC. In general, modified in very invalid ways that were still useable for the attacker but no one else,\" Spink told BleepingComputer.\nCrushFTP recommends reviewing the upload and download logs for unusual activity and taking the following steps to mitigate exploitation:\nIP whitelisting for server and admin access\nUse of a DMZ instance\nEnabling automatic updates\nHowever, cybersecurity firm Rapid7 says using a DMZ may not be a reliable strategy to prevent exploitation.\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, Rapid7 advises against relying on a demilitarized zone (DMZ) as a mitigation strategy,\"\nwarned Rapid7\n.\nAt this time, it is unclear if the attacks were used for data theft or to deploy malware. However, managed file transfer solutions have become high-value targets for data theft campaigns in recent years.\nIn the past, ransomware gangs, usually Clop, have repeatedly exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in similar platforms, including\nCleo\n,\nMOVEit Transfer\n,\nGoAnywhere MFT\n, and\nAccellion FTA\n, to conduct mass data theft and extortion attacks.\nCloud Detection & Response for Dummies\nContain emerging threats in real time - before they impact your business.\nLearn how cloud detection and response (CDR) gives security teams the edge they need in this practical, no-nonsense guide.\nGet the Guide\nRelated Articles:\nHackers exploit OttoKit WordPress plugin flaw to add admin accounts\nGoogle fixes fourth actively exploited Chrome zero-day of 2025\nHackers exploited Windows WebDav zero-day to drop malware\nGoogle patches new Chrome zero-day bug exploited in attacks\nQualcomm fixes three Adreno GPU zero-days exploited in attacks"

These packages were installing a script  coming from the same GitHub repository that was identified as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\"\nOne of the malicious AUR packages\nSource: BleepingComputer\nThe AUR is a repository where Arch Linux users can publish package build scripts (PKGBUILDs) to automate the process of downloading, building, and installing software that is not included with the operating system.\nHowever, like many other package repositories, the AUR has no format review process for new or updated packages, making it the user's responsibility to review the code and installation scripts before building and installing the package.\nAlthough all the packages have now been removed, BleepingComputer found archived copies of all three, indicating that the threat actor began submitting the packages at 18:46 UTC on July 16.\nEach package, \"\nlibrewolf-fix-bin\n\", \"\nfirefox-patch-bin\n\", and \"\nzen-browser-patched-bin\n,\" all contained a source entry in the PKGBUILD file called \"\npatches\n\" that pointed to a GitHub repository under the attacker's control: https://github.com/danikpapas/zenbrowser-patch.git.\nWhen the BUILDPKG is processed, this repository is cloned and treated as part of the package's patching and building process. However, instead of being a legitimate patch, the GitHub repository contained malicious code that was executed during the build or installation phase.\nThis GitHub repository has since been removed, and the .git repository is no longer available for analysis.\nHowever, a Reddit account began responding to various Arch Linux threads on the platform today, promoting these packages on the AUR. The comments were posted by an account that appears to have been dormant for years and likely compromised to spread the malicious packages.\nArch users on\nReddit\nquickly found the comments suspicious, with one of them uploading one of the components to\nVirusTotal\n, which detects it as the Linux malware called CHAOS RAT.\nCHAOS RAT is an open-source remote access trojan (RAT) for Windows and Linux that can be used to upload and download files, execute commands, and open a reverse shell. Ultimately, threat actors have full access to an infected device.\nOnce installed, the malware repeatedly connects back to a command and control (C2) server where it waits for commands to execute. In this campaign, the C2 server was located at 130.162[.]225[.]47:8080.\nThe malware is commonly used in cryptocurrency mining campaigns but can also be used for harvesting credentials, stealing data, or conducting cyber espionage.\nDue to the severity of the malware, anyone who has mistakenly installed these packages should immediately check for the presence of a suspicious \"systemd-initd\" executable running on their computer, which may be located in the /tmp folder. If found, it should be deleted.\nThe Arch Linux team removed all three packages by July 18th at around 6 PM UTC+2.\n\"We strongly encourage users that may have installed one of these packages to remove them from their system and to take the necessary measures in order to ensure they were not compromised,\" warned the Arch Linux team.\nThe Board Report Deck CISOs Actually Use\nCISOs know that getting board buy-in starts with a clear, strategic view of how cloud security drives business value.\nThis free, editable board report deck helps security leaders present risk, impact, and priorities in clear business terms.

In exchange, any ransom payments were split between the affiliate and the operators.\nWhile the ransomware operation did not receive as much media attention as other ransomware operations, Phobos is considered one of the most widely distributed ransomware operations, responsible for many attacks on businesses worldwide.\nIn 2023, a group of affiliates\nlaunched the 8-Base operation\nutilizing a modified Phobos encryptor. Unlike other affiliates, this group engaged in double extortion where they encrypted files and stole data, threatening to release it if a ransom was not paid.\nIn 2024, a Russian national suspected of being the administrator for the Phobos ransomware operation was\nextradited from South Korea to the United States\nto face charges in a 13-count indictment.\nThis year, the\nPhobos operation suffered a massive disruption\n, with a coordinated international law enforcement operation taking down and seizing 27 servers. As part of this operation, four Russian nationals suspected of leading the 8Base ransomware group were arrested.\nFree Phobos decryptor\nThe Japanese police have now released a free decryptor for organizations and people whose files were encrypted by Phobos and 8Base ransomware operations.\nWhile it is unclear how they were able to create the decryptor, it is believed it was made possible through information obtained during this year's disruption of the ransomware gang.\nThe decryptor can be downloaded from the\nJapanese police's website\n, with\ninstructions shared in English\n. The decryptor is also available from Europol's\nNoMoreRansom\nplatform and is being promoted by\nEuropol\nand the\nFBI\nto demonstrate its official status.\nIt should be noted that web browsers, including Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, are detecting the decryptor as malware, making it difficult to download and use. However, BleepingComputer has tested the decryptor, and not only is it not malicious, but it also successfully decrypts encrypted files from recent encryptors.\nThe decryptor currently supports encrypted files with the following extensions: \"\n.phobos\n\", \"\n.8base\n\", \"\n.elbie\n\", \"\n.faust\n\", and \"\n.LIZARD\n\".\nHowever, the Japanese police says that several other extensions may be supported, so it is worth testing the decryptor even if your files do not have the listed extensions.\nAs a test, BleepingComputer infected a virtual machine with a recent Phobos ransomware variant that adds the\n.LIZARD\nextension to encrypted file names, as shown below.\nFiles encrypted by \"Lizard\" Phobos ransomware variant\nSource: BleepingComputer\nTo decrypt files, launch the decryptor and agree to its license agreement.

        "Content": "Researchers are seeing exploitation attempts for the CVE-2025-48927 vulnerability in the TeleMessage SGNL app, which allows retrieving usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data.\nTeleMessage SGNL is a Signal clone app now\nowned by Smarsh\n, a compliance-focused company that provides cloud-based or on-premisses communication solutions to various organizations.\nScanning for vulnerable endpoints\nThreat monitoring firm GreyNoise has observed multiple attempts to exploit CVE-2025-48927, likely by different threat actors.\n“As of July 16, GreyNoise has observed 11 IPs attempting to exploit CVE-2025-48927,”\nreports GreyNoise\n.\n“Related reconnaissance behavior is ongoing. Our telemetry shows active scanning for Spring Boot Actuator endpoints, a potential precursor to identifying systems affected by CVE-2025-48927.”\nAccording to GreyNoise, more than two thousand IPs have scanned for Sprint Boot Actuator endpoints over the past months, a little over 75% of them targeting the ‘/health’ endpoints specifically.\nThe\nCVE-2025-48927\nvulnerability is caused by exposing the ‘/heapdump’ endpoint from Spring Boot Actuator without authentication. TeleMessage addressed the issue but some on-prem installations are still vulnerable.\nWhen using outdated Spring Boot configurations that do not restrict access to diagnostic endpoints, the flaw lets an attacker download a full Java heap memory dump of approximately 150MB, which may contain plaintext usernames, passwords, tokens, and other sensitive data.\nTo defend against these attacks, it is recommended to disable or restrict access to the /heapdump endpoint only to trusted IP ranges and limit the exposure of all Actuator endpoints as much as possible.\nArchiving Signal messages\nThe TeleMessage SGNL app is designed to provide encrypted communication with\nbuilt-in archival\n, so that all chats, calls, and attachments are automatically stored for compliance, auditing, or record-keeping.\nThese claims have been disputed by past research saying that end-to-end encryption isn’t maintained and sensitive data, including messages, is stored in plaintext.\nThis was\nexposed in May 2025\n, when a hacker accessed a diagnostic endpoint and downloaded credentials and archived content. The event triggered concerns about national security in the U.S., after revelations that the product was being used by the Customs & Border Protection and officials, including Mike Waltz.\nCVE-2025-48927 was disclosed in May and CISA added it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog on July 1, requesting that all federal agencies apply mitigations by July 22.\nThe agency also listed CVE-2025-48928, a flaw in SGNL where a JSP app exposes a memory dump containing passwords sent over HTTP to unauthorized users.\nCloud Detection & Response for Dummies\nContain emerging threats in real time - before they impact your business.\nLearn how cloud detection and response (CDR) gives security teams the edge they need in this practical, no-nonsense guide.\nGet the Guide\nRelated Articles:\nCitrix Bleed 2 exploited weeks before PoCs as Citrix denied attacks\nNew Fortinet FortiWeb hacks likely linked to public RCE exploits\nHackers exploit OttoKit WordPress plugin flaw to add admin accounts\nGoogle fixes actively exploited sandbox escape zero day in Chrome\nHackers are exploiting critical RCE flaw in Wing FTP Server"

        "Content": "Security researchers recently revealed that the personal information of millions of people who applied for jobs at McDonald’s was exposed after they guessed the password (“123456”) for the fast food chain’s account at Paradox.ai, a company that makes artificial intelligence based hiring chatbots used by many Fortune 500 firms. Paradox.ai said the security oversight was an isolated incident that did not affect its other customers, but recent security breaches involving its employees in Vietnam tell a more nuanced story.\nA screenshot of the paradox.ai homepage showing its AI hiring chatbot “Olivia” interacting with potential hires.\nEarlier this month, security researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry wrote about simple methods they found to access the backend of the AI chatbot platform on McHire.com, the McDonald’s website that many of its franchisees use to screen job applicants. As first reported by Wired, the researchers discovered that the weak password used by Paradox exposed 64 million records, including applicants’ names, email addresses and phone numbers.\nParadox.ai acknowledged the researchers’ findings but said the company’s other client instances were not affected, and that no sensitive information — such as Social Security numbers — was exposed.\n“We are confident, based on our records, this test account was not accessed by any third party other than the security researchers,” the company wrote in a July 9 blog post. “It had not been logged into since 2019 and frankly, should have been decommissioned. We want to be very clear that while the researchers may have briefly had access to the system containing all chat interactions (NOT job applications), they only viewed and downloaded five chats in total that had candidate information within. Again, at no point was any data leaked online or made public.”\nHowever, a review of stolen password data gathered by multiple breach-tracking services shows that at the end of June 2025, a Paradox.ai administrator in Vietnam suffered a malware compromise on their device that stole usernames and passwords for a variety of internal and third-party online services. The results were not pretty.\nThe password data from the Paradox.ai developer was stolen by a malware strain known as “Nexus Stealer,” a form grabber and password stealer that is sold on cybercrime forums. The information snarfed by stealers like Nexus is often recovered and indexed by data leak aggregator services like Intelligence X, which reports that the malware on the Paradox.ai developer’s device exposed hundreds of mostly poor and recycled passwords (using the same base password but slightly different characters at the end).\nThose purloined credentials show the developer in question at one point used the same seven-digit password to log in to Paradox.ai accounts for a number of Fortune 500 firms listed as customers on the company’s website, including Aramark, Lockheed Martin, Lowes, and Pepsi.\nSeven-character passwords, particularly those consisting entirely of numerals, are highly vulnerable to “brute-force” attacks that can try a large number of possible password combinations in quick succession. According to a much-referenced password strength guide maintained by Hive Systems, modern password-cracking systems can work out a seven number password more or less instantly.\nImage: hivesystems.com.\nIn response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity, Paradox.ai confirmed that the password data was recently stolen by a malware infection on the personal device of a longtime Paradox developer based in Vietnam, and said the company was made aware of the compromise shortly after it happened. Paradox maintains that few of the exposed passwords were still valid, and that a majority of them were present on the employee’s personal device only because he had migrated the contents of a password manager from an old computer.\nParadox also pointed out that it has been requiring single sign-on (SSO) authentication since 2020 that enforces multi-factor authentication for its partners. Still, a review of the exposed passwords shows they included the Vietnamese administrator’s credentials to the company’s SSO platform — paradoxai.okta.com. The password for that account ended in 202506 — possibly a reference to the month of June 2025 — and the digital cookie left behind after a successful Okta login with those credentials says it was valid until December 2025.\nAlso exposed were the administrator’s credentials and authentication cookies for an account at Atlassian, a platform made for software development and project management. The expiration date for that authentication token likewise was December 2025.\nInfostealer infections are among the leading causes of data breaches and ransomware attacks today, and they result in the theft of stored passwords and any credentials the victim types into a browser. Most infostealer malware also will siphon authentication cookies stored on the victim’s device, and depending on how those tokens are configured thieves may be able to use them to bypass login prompts and/or multi-factor authentication.\nQuite often these infostealer infections will open a backdoor on the victim’s device that allows attackers to access the infected machine remotely. Indeed, it appears that remote access to the Paradox administrator’s compromised device was offered for sale recently.\nIn February 2019, Paradox.ai announced it had successfully completed audits for two fairly comprehensive security standards (ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II). Meanwhile, the company’s security disclosure this month says the test account with the atrocious 123456 username and password was last accessed in 2019, but somehow missed in their annual penetration tests. So how did it manage to pass such stringent security audits with these practices in place?\nParadox.ai told KrebsOnSecurity that at the time of the 2019 audit, the company’s various contractors were not held to the same security standards the company practices internally. Paradox emphasized that this has changed, and that it has updated its security and password requirements multiple times since then.\nIt is unclear how the Paradox developer in Vietnam infected his computer with malware, but a closer review finds a Windows device for another Paradox.ai employee from Vietnam was compromised by similar data-stealing malware at the end of 2024 (that compromise included the victim’s GitHub credentials). In the case of both employees, the stolen credential data includes Web browser logs that indicate the victims repeatedly downloaded pirated movies and television shows, which are often bundled with malware disguised as a video codec needed to view the pirated content.\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Thursday 17th of July 2025 09:23 PM \r\n         \n“A developer”, so someone who should know better?\nBut plural its developers developers developers.  There’s no accountability when you’re just a hivemind.\nSomeone shocked me in a casual conversation on Wednesday when he argued that all wifi access points should have the password “12345678” (without the quotes) and he couldn’t understand why I thought that was a terrible idea. In the past he has said that no person, no business, and no government should be permitted to have any secrets.\nOn the surface, he’s one of the most intelligent people I know, but he doesn’t seem to have much in the way of common sense to guide his use of that intelligence.\nWhy don’t these systems adopt a delay and lockout after failed login attempts?\nEven my phone does this, requiring a ten minute rest after three failures; it completely locks up after a hundred (or something like that).\nWouldn’t this policy protect all but the most feeble passwords?\nThis is not that type of attack. The attack you are referring to is simply trying to guess a password, then entering that password to an online service at a login prompt. That type of attack is typically easily thwarted by the measures you mentioned… timeout, lockout, and rate limiting.\nThe attack the article is referring to is when a hacker breaks into a service and steals their encrypted user password database, then attempts to decrypt the passwords stored in the database. In this scenario the hacker gets an unlimited number of tries to decrypt the passwords.\nToo often also the timeout restrictions and MFA requirements for trying passwords can be bypassed by trying to log into an API (a programming interface rather than a user one) and trying user names and passwords there. If the developer codes the timeout into the mobile app or web interface only and not the actual API that those communicate with on the backend. And those API transactions may either not be logged the same way as the intended end user interactions, or those logs may not be analyzed for abuse.\n“the digital cookie left behind after a successful Okta login with those credentials says it was valid until December 2025”\nBut bear in mind this does not ipso facto mean that an Okta login is valid for six months. Okta could use all manner of logic on the server side to decide to reject a cookie that hasn’t expired. A shorter expiration, an unexpected IP address, or manual action by an administrator, to name a few. I don’t know which of this Okta has implemented; hopefully all of them and more.\nAll I could do after the first sentence of this article was laugh. They used 123456 as a password, and this year’s winner\nof the Darwin award is… Come on, use your pet’s name, it would be more secure.\nI’m gonna have to change the combination to my luggage.\nWhy in this day and age are they not using an API to prevent the use of passwords like this?\n> “123456”\n> seven character password\nDid you use an LLM to count the characters?\nThere’s nothing wrong with the story. I guess at some point they improved their passwords by adding a digit.\n“Paradox.ai told KrebsOnSecurity that at the time of the 2019 audit, the company’s various contractors were not held to the same security standards the company practices internally. Paradox emphasized that this has changed, and that it has updated its security and password requirements multiple times since then.”\nDoes this mean that Paradox took on jobs from customers to build something for them and then outsourced the implementation to contractors and never even bothered to verify whether the end result actually matches any product requirements (like features, quality and security)? 😮 If they did such checks, how could it escape them that a significant number of the delivered solutions (built by their contractors for Paradox customers, e.g. McDonalds, Aramark, Lockheed Martin, Lowes and Pepsi) allowed a password like “123456”? I mean checking password complexity requirements should be on the top of every kind of security reviews/audits. Paradox’s reasoning sounds very weak to say the least.\nYour email address will not be published.

        "Content": "The Akira ransomware group has allegedly intensified its campaign, adding 12 new victims to its dark web data leak portal between July 15 and July 17, 2025. This string of attacks targets a diverse range of industries across the globe, from food production and manufacturing to legal and IT services. The group operates on a double-extortion model, exfiltrating sensitive data before encrypting the victim’s systems and threatening to publish the stolen information if a ransom is not paid.\nThe list of allegedly compromised organizations spans multiple sectors and countries, highlighting the indiscriminate nature of the ransomware gang. The threat actors have provided descriptions of the companies and have begun listing the types of sensitive data they claim to have stolen, putting significant pressure on the victims. The victims include:\n🇺🇸\nThe Colgin Companies:\nA US-based company that offers authentic liquid smoke sauces. The group claims to have stolen files related to clients, contracts, and agreements.\n🇮🇹\nMazzoleni:\nAn Italian firm specializing in the drawing, heat treatment, and coating of steel wires. Allegedly exfiltrated data includes agreements, detailed financial data, and other confidential files.\n🇮🇹\nStudioc:\nAn IT consulting and services firm. The group claims to possess its accounting and financial data, as well as client information.\n🇩🇪\nBAF Management Consulting:\nA consulting services provider. Stolen data allegedly includes client accounting and financial information, along with employee data.\n🇺🇸\nPEPRO:\nA US-based manufacturer of shielded enclosure systems for mission-critical communications. The group threatens to leak over 15 GB of data, including employee personal documents, customer information, financial data, contracts, and NDAs.\n🇺🇸\nTitle XI:\nA software and support company providing cloud-based case management for bankruptcy trustees. The attackers claim to have over 50 GB of data, including a huge amount of customer personal information like financial statements, passport/DL/SSN scans, employee information, court documents, and NDAs.\n🇮🇹\nAcetificio Andrea Milano:\nA historic Italian vinegar production company. Over 47 GB of data was allegedly stolen, containing personal document scans of owners and employees, financial data, customer information, and NDAs.\n🇺🇸\nGoldberg & Osborne:\nA law firm representing plaintiff injury victims. The group boasts of having over 150 GB of data, including personal documents of more than 200 clients, passports, medical records, financial data, and court documents.\n🇺🇸\nGreenVest:\nAn environmental development and consulting firm. The breach allegedly involves over 7 GB of financial data and project files.\n🇷🇴\nMultilift Logistic Group:\nA company specializing in port operations and terminal warehousing. The threat actors claim to have 17 GB of data, including complete employee personal information with passport scans, client data, and numerous contracts.\n🇬🇧\nFayrefield Foods:\nA producer and marketer of dairy products across Europe, the Middle East, and North America. Over 41 GB of data was allegedly exfiltrated, including employee scans, financial files, client information, contracts, and NDAs.\n🇸🇪\nSib-Tryck Holding:\nA digital printing firm from Sweden. The group claims to have 45 GB of corporate documents, including client and employee information, project data, and agreements.\nThe publication of these companies on Akira’s leak site serves as a public declaration of the breach and the starting point for the countdown until the data is potentially released. This tactic aims to maximize pressure on the victims to negotiate a payment. The diverse nature of the targeted industries demonstrates that no sector is immune to such cyber attacks, and the claimed data types, particularly from the legal and software firms, could have severe consequences for both the companies and their clients if released.\nTags:\nAcetificio Andrea Milano\nAkira\nBAF Management Consulting\ncyber-attack\nCyberSecurity\ndata-breach\nFayrefield Foods\nGoldberg & Osborne\nGreenVest\nMazzoleni\nMultilift Logistic Group\nPEPRO\nransomware\nSib-Tryck Holding\nStudioc\nThe Colgin Companies\nTitle XI"

        "Content": "A cybercriminal is allegedly selling a zero-day exploit that targets the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) of gas pump automation systems developed by a Russian company. The seller claims the vulnerability allows for complete control over the affected gas pumps, posing a significant threat to potentially thousands of gas stations.\nThe targeted system is the “БУК TS-G” (BUK TS-G), a gas station automation system created by “Нефтепродукттехника” (Nefteprodukttekhnika), a company based in Russia. This system is reportedly utilized in over 2,500 gas stations across Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), highlighting the widespread potential impact of the alleged exploit. The “БУК TS-G” system manages the core operations of a gas station, including fuel dispensing, payment processing, and monitoring of tank levels. An exploit affecting this system could lead to severe disruptions and financial damage.\nAccording to a post on a criminal forum, the zero-day exploit is being offered for $40,000. The seller alleges that the vulnerability grants full administrative access to the gas pump’s control panel. The potential for misuse is significant, with the seller listing a range of malicious actions possible through this access. The leaked data titles or capabilities allegedly include:\nInventory access and manipulation\nComplete closure of services\nAbility to alter system settings\nThe seller claims that over 50 publicly accessible devices are vulnerable, with the implication that many more private or internally-hosted systems are also at risk. If the claims are accurate, this vulnerability could be exploited to manipulate fuel prices, steal fuel by altering pump readings, or cause widespread service outages at affected gas stations. The alleged sale of such a powerful exploit underscores the growing threat of cyberattacks against critical infrastructure.\nTags:\n0-day exploit\nCritical Infrastructure\ncybercrime\nCyberSecurity\ngas station\nHMI\nRussia\nvulnerability"
