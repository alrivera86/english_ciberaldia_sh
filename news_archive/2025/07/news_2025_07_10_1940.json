The npm package has been\ndownloaded\nmore than 437,000 times to date.\nThe vulnerability affects mcp-remote versions from 0.0.5 to 0.1.15. It has been addressed in version 0.1.16 released on June 17, 2025. Anyone using mcp-remote that connects to an untrusted or insecure MCP server using an affected version is at risk.\n\"While previously published research has demonstrated risks from MCP clients connecting to malicious MCP servers, this is the first time that full remote code execution is achieved in a real-world scenario on the client operating system when connecting to an untrusted remote MCP server,\" Peles said.\nThe shortcoming has to do with how a malicious MCP server operated by a threat actor could embed a command during the initial communication establishment and authorization phase, which, when processed by mcp-remote, causes it to be executed on the underlying operating system.\nWhile the issue leads to arbitrary OS command execution on Windows with full parameter control, it results in the execution of arbitrary executables with limited parameter control on macOS and Linux systems.\nTo mitigate the risk posed by the flaw, users are advised to update the library to the latest version and only connect to trusted MCP servers over HTTPS.\n\"While remote MCP servers are highly effective tools for expanding AI capabilities in managed environments, facilitating rapid iteration of code, and helping ensure more reliable delivery of software, MCP users need to be mindful of only connecting to trusted MCP servers using secure connection methods such as HTTPS,\" Peles said.\n\"Otherwise, vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-6514 are likely to hijack MCP clients in the ever-growing MCP ecosystem.\"\nThe disclosure comes after Oligo Security\ndetailed\na critical vulnerability in the MCP Inspector tool (CVE-2025-49596, CVSS score: 9.4) that could pave the way for remote code execution.\nEarlier this month, two other high-severity security defects were uncovered in Anthropic's\nFilesystem MCP Server\n, which, if successfully exploited, could let attackers break out of the server's sandbox, manipulate any file on the host, and achieve code execution.\nThe two flaws, per Cymulate, are listed below -\nCVE-2025-53110\n(CVSS score: 7.3) - A directory containment bypass that makes it possible to access, read, or write outside of the approved directory (e.g., \"/private/tmp/allowed_dir\") by using the allowed directory prefix on other directories (e.g., \"/private/tmp/allow_dir_sensitive_credentials\"), thereby opening the door data theft and possible privilege escalation\nCVE-2025-53109\n(CVSS score: 8.4) - A symbolic link (aka symlink) bypass stemming from poor error handling that can be used to point to any file on the file system from within the allowed directory, allowing an attacker to read or alter critical files (e.g., \"/etc/sudoers\") or drop malicious code, resulting in code execution by making use of Launch Agents, cron jobs, or other persistence techniques\nBoth shortcomings impact all Filesystem MCP Server versions prior to 0.6.3 and 2025.7.1, which include the relevant fixes.\n\"This vulnerability is a serious breach of the Filesystem MCP Servers security model,\" security researcher Elad Beber\nsaid\nabout CVE-2025-53110. \"Attackers can gain unauthorized access by listing, reading or writing to directories outside the allowed scope, potentially exposing sensitive files like credentials or configurations.\"\n\"Worse, in setups where the server runs as a privileged user, this flaw could lead to privilege escalation, allowing attackers to manipulate critical system files and gain deeper control over the host system.\"\nFound this article interesting?

The campaign was codenamed Meeten by Cado Security (which was acquired by Darktrace earlier this year) in reference to one of the phony videoconferencing services.\nThat said, there are indications that the activity may have been ongoing since at least March 2024, when Jamf Threat Labs\ndisclosed\nthe use of a domain named \"meethub[.]gg\" to deliver Realst.\nThe latest findings from Darktrace show that the campaign not only still remains an active threat, but has also adopted a broader range of themes related to artificial intelligence, gaming, Web3, and social media.\nFurthermore, the attackers have been observed leveraging compromised X accounts associated with companies and employees, primarily those that are verified, to approach prospective targets and give their fake companies an illusion of legitimacy.\n\"They make use of sites that are used frequently with software companies such as X, Medium, GitHub, and Notion,\" Gould said. \"Each company has a professional looking website that includes employees, product blogs, whitepapers and roadmaps.\"\nOne such non-existent company is Eternal Decay (@metaversedecay), which claims to be a blockchain-powered game and has shared digitally altered versions of legitimate pictures on X to give the impression that they are presenting at various conferences. The end goal is to build an online presence that makes these firms appear as real as possible and increases the likelihood of infection.\nSome of the other identified companies are listed below -\nBeeSync (X accounts: @BeeSyncAI, @AIBeeSync)\nBuzzu (X accounts: @BuzzuApp, @AI_Buzzu, @AppBuzzu, @BuzzuApp)\nCloudsign (X account: @cloudsignapp)\nDexis (X account: @DexisApp)\nKlastAI (X account: Links to Pollens AI's X account)\nLunelior\nNexLoop (X account: @nexloopspace)\nNexoraCore\nNexVoo (X account: @Nexvoospace)\nPollens AI (X accounts: @pollensapp, @Pollens_app)\nSlax (X accounts: @SlaxApp, @Slax_app, @slaxproject)\nSolune (X account: @soluneapp)\nSwox (X accounts: @SwoxApp, @Swox_AI, @swox_app, @App_Swox, @AppSwox, @SwoxProject, @ProjectSwox)\nWasper (X accounts: @wasperAI, @WasperSpace)\nYondaAI (X account: @yondaspace)\nThe attack chains begin when one of these adversary-controlled accounts messages a victim through X, Telegram, or Discord, urging them to test out their software in exchange for a cryptocurrency payment.\nShould the target agree to the test, they are redirected to a fictitious website from where they are promoted to enter a registration code provided by the employee to download either a Windows Electron application or an Apple disk image (DMG) file, depending on the operating system used.\nOn Windows systems, opening the malicious application displays a Cloudflare verification screen to the victim while it covertly profiles the machine and proceeds to download and execute an MSI installer. Although the exact nature of the payload is unclear, it's believed that an information stealer is run at this stage.\nThe macOS version of the attack, on the other hand, leads to the deployment of the Atomic macOS Stealer (\nAMOS\n), a known infostealer malware that can siphon documents as well as data from web browsers and crypto wallets, and exfiltrate the details to external server.\nThe DMG binary is also equipped to fetch a shell script that's responsible for setting up persistence on the system using a\nLaunch Agent\nto ensure that the app starts automatically upon user login. The script also retrieves and runs an Objective-C/Swift binary that logs application usage and user interaction timestamps, and transmits them to a remote server.\nDarktrace also noted that the campaign shares tactical similarities with those orchestrated by a traffers group called\nCrazy Evil\nthat's known to dupe victims into installing malware such as StealC, AMOS, and Angel Drainer.\n\"While it is unclear if the campaigns [...] can be attributed to CrazyEvil or any sub teams, the techniques described are similar in nature,\" Gould said. \"This campaign highlights the efforts that threat actors will go to make these fake companies look legitimate in order to steal cryptocurrency from victims, in addition to the use of newer evasive versions of malware.\"\nFound this article interesting?

They were apprehended in the West Midlands and London on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offenses, blackmail, money laundering, and participating in the activities of an organized crime group.\nAll four suspects were arrested from their homes and their electronic devices have been seized for further forensic analysis. Their names were not disclosed.\n\"Since these attacks took place, specialist NCA cybercrime investigators have been working at pace and the investigation remains one of the Agency's highest priorities,\" Deputy Director Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit,\nsaid\nin a statement.\n\"Today's arrests are a significant step in that investigation but our work continues, alongside partners in the U.K. and overseas, to ensure those responsible are identified and brought to justice.\"\nAccording to the Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC), the April 2025 cyber attacks targeting Marks & Spencer and Co-op have been\nclassified\nas a \"single combined cyber event\" with a financial impact of anywhere between £270 million ($363 million) and £440 million ($592 million).\nThe NCA did not name the \"organized crime group\" the individuals are part of, but it's\nbelieved\nthat some of these attacks have been perpetrated by a decentralized cybercrime crew called\nScattered Spider\n, which is notorious for its advanced social engineering ploys to breach organizations and deploy ransomware.\nIn a Business and Trade Sub-Committee on Economic Security, Arms and Export Controls Committee hearing at the U.K. Parliament on July 8, Marks & Spencer\nsaid\nthe attack on its systems was ransomware-related and that it was carried out by the\nDragonForce\nransomware group, working together with other \"loosely aligned\" actors.\n\"While ransomware is an ever-present threat, Scattered Spider represents a persistent and capable adversary whose operations have been historically effective even against organizations with mature security programs,\" Grayson North, Senior Security Consultant at GuidePoint Security, told The Hacker News.\n\"The success of Scattered Spider is not exactly the result of any new or novel tactics, but rather their expertise in social engineering and willingness to be extremely persistent in attempting to gain initial access to their targets.\"\nThe majority of individuals associated with the\nfinancially driven group\nare young,\nnative English speakers\nwhich gives them an edge when attempting to gain trust with their targets by making fake calls to IT help desks posing as employees.\nScattered Spider is part of The Com, a larger loose-knit collective that's responsible for a wide range of crimes, including social engineering, phishing, SIM swapping, extortion, sextortion, swatting, kidnapping, and murder.\n\"Scattered Spider demonstrates a calculated and opportunistic targeting strategy, rotating across industries and geographies based on visibility, payout potential, and operational heat,\" Halcyon\npointed out\n.\nGoogle-owned Mandiant said Scattered Spider has a habit of focusing on a single sector at a time, while keeping their core tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) consistent. This includes\nsetting up phishing domains\nthat closely mimic legitimate corporate login portals and are designed to trick employees into revealing their credentials.\n\"This means that organizations can take proactive steps like training their help desk staff to enforce robust identity verification processes and deploying phishing-resistant MFA to defend against these intrusions,\" said Charles Carmakal, CTO, Mandiant Consulting at Google Cloud.\nCarmakal also called the arrests of alleged Scattered Spider members a \"significant win\" in the fight against the e-crime syndicate, adding the action illustrates the importance of international collaboration in tackling such threats.\n\"Their aggressive social engineering tactics and relentless pursuit of access have proven particularly challenging for many defenders, and resulted in considerable damage to organizations in the U.K. and U.S.,\" Carmakal added. \"Previous arrests have impacted their operations, causing a significant lull in activity.

        "Content": "Generative AI is not arriving with a bang, it's slowly creeping into the software that companies already use on a daily basis. Whether it is video conferencing or CRM, vendors are scrambling to integrate AI copilots and assistants into their SaaS applications. Slack can now provide AI summaries of chat threads, Zoom can provide meeting summaries, and office suites such as Microsoft 365 contain AI assistance in writing and analysis. This trend of AI usage implies that the majority of businesses are awakening to a new reality: AI capabilities have spread across their SaaS stack overnight, with no centralized control.\nA recent\nsurvey\nfound 95% of U.S. companies are now using generative AI, up massively in just one year. Yet this unprecedented usage comes tempered by growing anxiety. Business leaders have begun to worry about where all this unseen AI activity might lead. Data security and privacy have quickly emerged as top concerns, with many fearing that sensitive information could leak or be misused if AI usage remains unchecked. We've already seen some cautionary examples: global banks and tech firms have banned or restricted tools like ChatGPT internally after incidents of confidential data being shared inadvertently.\nWhy SaaS AI Governance Matters\nWith AI woven into everything from messaging apps to customer databases, governance is the only way to harness the benefits without inviting new risks.\nWhat do we mean by\nAI governance\n?\nIn simple terms, it basically refers to the policies, processes, and controls that ensure AI is used responsibly and securely within an organization. Done right, AI governance keeps these tools from becoming a free-for-all and instead aligns them with a company's security requirements, compliance obligations, and ethical standards.\nThis is especially important in the SaaS context, where data is constantly flowing to third-party cloud services.\n1.\nData exposure\nis the most immediate worry. AI features often need access to large swaths of information – think of a sales AI that reads through customer records, or an AI assistant that combs your calendar and call transcripts. Without oversight, an unsanctioned AI integration could tap into confidential customer data or intellectual property and send it off to an external model. In one\nsurvey\n, over 27% of organizations said they banned generative AI tools outright after privacy scares. Clearly, nobody wants to be the next company in the headlines because an employee fed sensitive data to a chatbot.\n2.\nCompliance violations\nare another concern. When employees use AI tools without approval, it creates blind spots that can lead to breaches of laws like GDPR or HIPAA. For example, uploading a client's personal information into an AI translation service might violate privacy regulations – but if it's done without IT's knowledge, the company may have no idea it happened until an audit or breach occurs. Regulators worldwide are expanding laws around AI use, from the EU's new AI Act to sector-specific guidance. Companies need governance to ensure they can prove what AI is doing with their data, or face penalties down the line.\n3.\nOperational reasons\nare another reason to rein in AI sprawl. AI systems can introduce biases or make poor decisions (hallucinations) that impact real people. A hiring algorithm might inadvertently discriminate, or a finance AI might give inconsistent results over time as its model changes. Without guidelines, these issues go unchecked. Business leaders recognize that managing AI risks isn't just about avoiding harm, it can also be a competitive advantage. Those who start to use AI ethically and transparently can generally build greater trust with customers and regulators.\nThe Challenges of Managing AI in the SaaS World\nUnfortunately, the very nature of AI adoption in companies today makes it hard to pin down. One big challenge is visibility. Often, IT and security teams simply don't know how many AI tools or features are in use across the organization. Employees eager to boost productivity can enable a new AI-based feature or sign up for a clever AI app in seconds, without any approval. These shadow AI instances fly under the radar, creating pockets of unchecked data usage. It's the classic shadow IT problem amplified: you can't secure what you don't even realize is there.\nCompounding the problem is the fragmented ownership of AI tools. Different departments might each introduce their own AI solutions to solve local problems – Marketing tries an AI copywriter, engineering experiments with an AI code assistant, customer support integrates an AI chatbot – all without coordinating with each other. With no real centralized strategy, each of these tools might apply different (or nonexistent) security controls. There's no single point of accountability, and important questions start to fall through the cracks:\n1. Who vetted the AI vendor's security?\n2. Where is the data going?\n3. Did anyone set usage boundaries?\nThe end result is an organization using AI in a dozen different ways, with loads of gaps that an attacker could potentially exploit.\nPerhaps the most serious problem is the lack of data provenance with AI interactions. An employee could copy proprietary text and paste it into an AI writing assistant, get a polished result back, and use that in a client presentation – all outside normal IT monitoring. From the company's perspective, that sensitive data just left their environment without a trace. Traditional security tools might not catch it because no firewall was breached and no abnormal download occurred; the data was voluntarily given away to an AI service. This black box effect, where prompts and outputs aren't logged, makes it extremely hard for organizations to ensure compliance or investigate incidents.\nDespite these hurdles, companies can't afford to throw up their hands.\nThe answer is to bring the same rigor to AI that's applied to other technology – without stifling innovation. It's a delicate balance: security teams don't want to become the department of no that\nbans\nevery useful AI tool. The goal of SaaS AI governance is to enable safe adoption. That means putting protection in place so employees can leverage AI's benefits while minimizing the downsides.\n5 Best Practices for AI Governance in SaaS\nEstablishing AI governance might sound daunting, but it becomes manageable by breaking it into a few concrete steps. Here are some best practices that leading organizations are using to get control of AI in their SaaS environment:\n1. Inventory Your AI Usage\nStart by shining a light on the shadow. You can't govern what you don't know exists. Take an audit of all AI-related tools, features, and integrations in use. This includes obvious standalone AI apps and less obvious things like AI features within standard software (for example, that new AI meeting notes feature in your video platform). Don't forget browser extensions or unofficial tools employees might be using. A lot of companies are surprised by how long the list is once they look. Create a centralized registry of these AI assets noting what they do, which business units use them, and what data they touch. This living inventory becomes the foundation for all other governance efforts.\n2. Define Clear AI Usage Policies\nJust as you likely have an acceptable use policy for IT, make one specifically for AI. Employees need to know what's allowed and what's off-limits when it comes to AI tools. For instance, you might permit using an AI coding assistant on open-source projects but forbid feeding any customer data into an external AI service. Specify guidelines for handling data (e.g. \"no sensitive personal info in any generative AI app unless approved by security\") and require that new AI solutions be vetted before use. Educate your staff on these rules and the reasons behind them. A little clarity up front can prevent a lot of risky experimentation.\n3. Monitor and Limit Access\nOnce AI tools are in play, keep tabs on their behavior and access. Principle of least privilege applies here: if an AI integration only needs read access to a calendar, don't give it permission to modify or delete events. Regularly review what data each AI tool can reach. Many SaaS platforms provide admin consoles or logs – use them to see how often an AI integration is being invoked and whether it's pulling unusually large amounts of data. If something looks off or outside policy, be ready to intervene. It's also wise to set up alerts for certain triggers, like an employee attempting to connect a corporate app to a new external AI service.\n4. Continuous Risk Assessment\nAI governance is not a set and forget task. AI changes too quickly. Establish a process to re-evaluate risks on a regular schedule – say monthly or quarterly. This could involve rescanning the environment for any newly introduced AI tools, reviewing updates or new features released by your SaaS vendors, and staying up to date on AI vulnerabilities. Make adjustments to your policies as needed (for example, if research exposes a new vulnerability like a prompt injection attack, update your controls to address it). Some organizations form an AI governance committee with stakeholders from security, IT, legal, and compliance to review AI use cases and approvals on an ongoing basis.\n5. Cross-Functional Collaboration\nFinally, governance isn't solely an IT or security responsibility. Make AI a team sport. Bring in legal and compliance officers to help interpret new regulations and ensure your policies meet them. Include business unit leaders so that governance measures align with business needs (and so they act as champions for responsible AI use in their teams). Involve data privacy experts to assess how data is being used by AI. When everyone understands the shared goal – to use AI in ways that are innovative and safe – it creates a culture where following the governance process is seen as enabling success, not hindering it.\nTo translate theory into practice, use this checklist to track your progress:\nGovernance Action\nDone\nInventory all SaaS apps and AI tools in use (including shadow AI and embedded features)\nDevelop and distribute a clear AI usage policy (data handling, approved tools, vetting process)\nImplement strict access control measures (least privilege access, regular permission reviews)\nMonitor all AI data access (using automated tools for oversight and alerts)\nConduct periodic risk reviews (assessing new tools, vendor updates, threats)\nBy taking these foundational steps, organizations can use AI to increase productivity while ensuring security, privacy, and compliance are protected.\nHow Reco Simplifies AI Governance\nWhile establishing AI governance frameworks is critical, the manual effort required to track, monitor, and manage AI across hundreds of SaaS applications can quickly overwhelm security teams. This is where specialized platforms like Reco's Dynamic SaaS Security solution can make the difference between theoretical policies and practical protection.\n👉\nGet a demo\nof Reco to assess the AI-related risks in your SaaS apps.\nFound this article interesting?\nThis article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.\nFollow us on\nTwitter\n\nand\nLinkedIn\nto read more exclusive content we post."

Some of the other popular software that has been trojanized to deliver the malware include Microsoft's Remote Desktop for Mac, along with SecureCRT and Navicat.\nThe fact that ZuRu primarily relies on sponsored web searches for distribution indicates the threat actors behind the malware are more opportunistic than targeted in their attacks, while also ensuring that only those looking for remote connections and database management are compromised.\nLike the samples detailed by Jamf, the newly discovered ZuRu artifacts employ a modified version of the open-source post-exploitation toolkit known as\nKhepri\nto enable attackers to gain remote control of infected hosts.\n\"The malware is delivered via a .dmg disk image and contains a hacked version of the genuine Termius.app,\" the researchers said. \"Since the application bundle inside the disk image has been modified, the attackers have replaced the developer's code signature with their own ad hoc signature in order to pass macOS code signing rules.\"\nThe altered app packs in two extra executables within Termius Helper.app, a loader named \".localized\" that's designed to download and launch a Khepri command-and-control (C2) beacon from an external server (\"download.termius[.]info\") and \".Termius Helper1,\" which is a renamed version of the actual Termius Helper app.\n\"While the use of Khepri was seen in earlier versions of ZuRu, this means of trojanizing a legitimate application varies from the threat actor's previous technique,\" the researchers explained.\n\"In older versions of ZuRu, the malware authors modified the main bundle's executable by adding an additional load command referencing an external .dylib, with the dynamic library functioning as the loader for the Khepri backdoor and persistence modules.\"\nBesides downloading the Khepri beacon, the loader is designed to set up persistence on the host and checks if the malware is already present at a pre-defined path in the system and employs(\"/tmp/.fseventsd\") and if so, compares the MD5 hash value of the payload against the one that's hosted on the server.\nA new version is subsequently downloaded if the hash values don't match. It's believed that the feature likely serves as an update mechanism to fetch new versions of the malware as they become available. But SentinelOne also theorized it could be a way to ensure that the payload has not been corrupted or modified after it was dropped.\nThe modified Khepri tool is a feature-packed C2 implant that allows file transfer, system reconnaissance, process execution and control, and command execution with output capture. The C2 server used to communicate with the beacon is \"ctl01.termius[.]fun.\"\n\"The latest variant of macOS.ZuRu continues the threat actor's pattern of trojanizing legitimate macOS applications used by developers and IT professionals,\" the researchers said.\n\"The shift in technique from Dylib injection to trojanizing an embedded helper application is likely an attempt to circumvent certain kinds of detection logic. Even so, the actor's continued use of certain TTPs - from choice of target applications and domain name patterns to the reuse of file names, persistence and beaconing methods - suggest these are offering continued success in environments lacking sufficient endpoint protection.\"\nFound this article interesting?

As the load did not actually complete, data associated with that load is considered invalid. The load will be re-executed later in order to complete successfully, and any dependent operations will re-execute with the valid data when it is ready.\nUnlike other speculative behavior such as Predictive Store Forwarding, loads that experience a false completion do not result in an eventual pipeline flush. While the invalid data associated with a false completion may be forwarded to dependent operations, load and store instructions which consume this data will not attempt to fetch data or update any cache or TLB state. As such, the value of this invalid data cannot be inferred using standard transient side channel methods.\nIn processors affected by TSA, the invalid data may however affect the timing of other instructions being executed by the CPU in a way that may be detectable by an attacker.\nThe chipmaker said it has identified two variants of TSA, TSA-L1 and TSA-SQ, based on the source of the invalid data associated with a false completion: either the L1 data cache or the CPU store queue.\nIn a worst-case scenario, successful attacks carried out using TSA-L1 or TSA-SQ flaws could lead to information leakage from the operating system kernel to a user application, from a hypervisor to a guest virtual machine, or between two user applications.\nWhile TSA-L1 is caused by an error in the way the L1 cache uses microtags for data-cache lookups, TSA-SQ vulnerabilities arise when a load instruction erroneously retrieves data from the CPU store queue when the necessary data isn't yet available. In both cases, an attacker could infer any data that is present within the L1 cache or used by an older store, even if they were executed in a different context.\nThat said, exploiting these flaws requires an attacker to obtain malicious access to a machine and possess the ability to run arbitrary code. It's not exploitable through malicious websites.\n\"The conditions required to exploit TSA are typically transitory as both the microtag and store queue will be updated after the CPU detects the false completion,\" AMD said.\n\"Consequently, to reliably exfiltrate data, an attacker must typically be able to invoke the victim many times to repeatedly create the conditions for the false completion. This is most likely possible when the attacker and victim have an existing communication path, such as between an application and the OS kernel.\"\nFound this article interesting?

It has been codenamed\nCount(er) Strike\n.\n\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Now Platform that could result in data being inferred without authorization,\" ServiceNow\nsaid\nin a bulletin. \"Under certain conditional access control list (ACL) configurations, this vulnerability could enable unauthenticated and authenticated users to use range query requests to infer instance data that is not intended to be accessible to them.\"\nCybersecurity company Varonis, which discovered and reported the flaw in February 2024, said it could have been exploited by malicious actors to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information, including personally identifiable information (PII) and credentials.\nAt its core, the shortcoming impacts the record count UI element on list pages, which could be trivially abused to infer and expose confidential data from various tables within ServiceNow.\n\"This vulnerability could have potentially affected all ServiceNow instances, impacting hundreds of tables,\" Varonis researcher Neta Armon\nsaid\nin a Wednesday analysis.\n\"Most concerning, this vulnerability was relatively simple to exploit and required only minimal table access, such as a weak user account within the instance or even a self-registered anonymous user, which could bypass the need for privilege elevation and resulted in sensitive data exposure.\"\nSpecifically, the company found that access to ServiceNow tables, while governed by ACL configurations, could be used to glean information, even in scenarios where access is denied due to a failed \"Data Condition\" or \"Script Condition\" -- which makes it possible to conditionally provide access based on an evaluation of certain data-related criteria or custom logic.\nIn these cases, users are displayed a message, stating \"Number of rows removed from this list by Security constraints\" along with the count. However, when access to a resource is blocked due to \"Required Roles\" or \"Security Attribute Condition,\" users are displayed a blank page with the message \"Security constraints prevent access to the requested page.\"\nIt's worth mentioning that the four ACL conditions are evaluated in a particular order, starting with roles, followed by security attributes, data condition, and lastly, script condition. For a user to gain access to a resource, all of these conditions must be satisfied. Any condition that's left empty is considered as not having any kind of restriction.\nThe fact that the responses are different based on the four ACL conditions opens a new attack pathway that a threat actor can exploit to determine which access conditions are not satisfied, and then repeatedly query the database table to enumerate the desired information using a combination of query parameters and filters. Tables protected only by a data or script condition are susceptible to the inference attack.\n\"Any user in an instance can exploit this vulnerability, even those with minimal privileges and no assigned roles, as long as they have access to at least one misconfigured table,\" Armon said. \"This vulnerability applies to any table in the instance with at least one ACL rule where the first two conditions are either left empty or are overly permissive — a common situation.\"\nTo make matters worse, a threat actor could expand the blast radius of the flaw using techniques like\ndot-walking\nand\nself-registration\nto access additional data from referenced tables, create accounts and gain access to an instance without requiring prior approval from an administrator.\nServiceNow, in response to the findings, has introduced new security mechanisms, such as\nQuery ACLs\n,\nSecurity Data Filters\n, and\nDeny-Unless ACLs\n, to counter the risk posed by the data inference blind query attack. While there is no evidence that the issue was ever exploited in the wild, all ServiceNow customers are urged to apply the necessary guardrails on sensitive tables.\n\"ServiceNow customers should also be aware that query range Query ACLs will soon be set to default deny, so they should create exclusions to maintain authorized user ability to perform such actions,\" Armon said.\nDLL Hijacking Flaw in Lenovo's TrackPoint Quick Menu Software\nThe development comes as TrustedSec detailed a privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2025-1729) in TrackPoint Quick Menu software (\"TPQMAssistant.exe\") present in Lenovo computers that could permit a local attacker to escalate privileges by means of a DLL hijacking vulnerability.\nThe flaw has been\naddressed\nin version 1.12.54.0 released on July 8, 2025, following responsible disclosure earlier this January.\n\"The directory housing 'TPQMAssistant.exe' is writable by standard users, which is already a red flag,\" security researcher Oddvar Moe\nsaid\n. \"The folder's permission allows the CREATOR OWNER to write files, meaning any local user can drop files into this location.\"\n\"When the scheduled task (or the binary itself) is triggered, it attempts to load 'hostfxr.dll' from its working directory but fails, resulting in a NAME NOT FOUND event. This tells us the binary is looking for a dependency that doesn't exist in its own directory – a perfect opportunity for sideloading.\"\nAs a result, an attacker can place a malicious version of 'hostfxr.dll' in the directory \"C: \\ProgramDatalLenovolTPQM\\Assistant\" to hijack control flow when the binary is launched, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.\nMicrosoft Addresses Kerberos DoS Bug\nThe findings also follow the public disclosure of an out-of-bounds read flaw in Windows Kerberos' Netlogon protocol (\nCVE-2025-47978\n, CVSS score: 6.5) that could permit an authorized attacker to deny service over a network. The vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft as part of its\nPatch Tuesday updates for July 2025\n.\nSilverfort, which has assigned the name\nNOTLogon\nto CVE-2025-47978, said it permits any \"domain-joined machine with minimal privileges to send a specially-crafted authentication request that will crash a domain controller and cause a full reboot.\"\n\"This vulnerability does not require elevated privileges -- only standard network access and a weak machine account are needed. In typical enterprise environments, any low-privileged user can create such accounts by default,\" security researcher Dor Segal\nsaid\n.\nThe cybersecurity company also noted that the crash primarily affected Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (\nLSASS\n), a critical security process in Windows that's responsible for enforcing security policies and handling user authentication. Successful exploitation of CVE-2025-47978 could therefore destabilize or disrupt Active Directory services.\n\"With only a valid machine account and a crafted RPC message, an attacker can remotely crash a domain controller – a system responsible for the core functionalities of Active Directory, including authentication, authorization, Group Policy enforcement, and service ticket issuance,\" Segal said.\nFound this article interesting?

At least one major OEM learned only recently about the security risks.\nThe security issues can be chained together into an exploit that researchers call a\nPerfektBlue attack\nand can be delivered over-the-air by an attacker, requiring \"at most 1-click from a user.\"\nAlthough OpenSynergy's BlueSDK is widely used in the automotive industry, vendors from other sectors also use it.\nPerfektBlue attacks\nThe pentesters team at\nPCA Cyber Security\n, a company specialized in automotive security, discovered the PerfektBlue vulnerabilities and reported them to OpenSynergy in May 2024. They are regular participants at Pwn2Own Automotive competitions and have uncovered over 50 vulnerabilities in car systems since last year.\nAccording to them, the PerfektBlue attack affects \"millions of devices in automotive and other industries.\"\nFinding the flaws in BlueSDK was possible by analyzing a compiled binary of the software product, since the did not have access to the source code.\nThe glitches, listed below, range in severity from low to high and can provide access to the car's internals through the infotainment system.\nCVE-2024-45434\n(high severity) – use-after-aree in the AVRCP service for Bluetooth profile that allows remote control over media devices\nCVE-2024-45431\n(low severity) – improper validation of an L2CAP ((Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol)) channel's remote channel identifier (CID)\nCVE-2024-45433\n(medium severity) – incorrect function termination in the Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) protocol\nCVE-2024-45432\n(medium severity) – function call with incorrect parameter in the RFCOMM protocol\nThe researchers did not share complete technical details about exploiting the PerfektBlue vulnerabilities but said that an attacker paired to the affected device could exploit them to \"manipulate the system, escalate privileges and perform lateral movement to other components of the target product.\"\nPCA Cyber Security\ndemonstrated PerfektBlue attacks\non infotainment head units in Volkswagen ID.4 (ICAS3 system), Mercedes-Benz (NTG6), and Skoda Superb (MIB3), and obtained a reverse shell on top of the TCP/IP that allows communication between devices on a network, such as components in a car.\nThe researchers say that with remote code execution on in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) a hacker could track GPS coordinates, eavesdrop on conversations in the car, access phone contacts, and potentially move laterally to more critical subsystems in the vehicle.\nGetting a reverse shell on a Mercedes-Benz NTG6 system\nSource: PCA Cyber Security\nRisk and exposure\nOpenSynergy's BlueSDK is widely used in the automotive industry but it is difficult to determine what vendors rely on it due to customization and repackaging processes, as well as lack of transparency regarding the embedded software components of a car.\nPerfektBlue is mainly a 1-click RCE because most of the times it requires tricking the user to allow pairing with an attacker device. However, some automakers configure infotainment systems to pair without any confirmation.\nPCA Cyber Security told BleepingComputer that they informed Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and Skoda about the vulnerabilities and gave them sufficient time to apply the patches but the researchers received no reply from the vendors about addressing the issues.\nBleepingComputer has contacted the three automakers asking if they pushed OpenSynergy's fixes. A statement from Mercedes was not immediately avaialable and Volkswagen said that they started investigating the impact and ways to address the risks immediatelly after learning about the issues.\n\"The investigations revealed that it is possible under certain conditions to connect to the vehicle's infotainment system via Bluetooth without authorization,\" a Volkwagen spokesperson told us.\nThe German car maker said that leveraging the vulnerabilities is possible only if several conditions are met at the same time:\nThe attacker is within a maximum distance of 5 to 7 meters from the vehicle.\nThe vehicle's ignition must be switched on.\nThe infotainment system must be in pairing mode, i.e., the vehicle user must be actively pairing a Bluetooth device.\nThe vehicle user must actively approve the external Bluetooth access of the attacker on the screen.\nEven if these conditions occur and an attacker connects to the Bluetooth interface, \"they must remain within a maximum distance of 5 to 7 meters from the vehicle\" to maintain access, the Volkswagen representative said.\nThe vendor underlined that in the case of a successful exploit, a hacker could not interfere with critical vehicle functions like steering, driver assistance, engine, or brakes because they are \"on a different control unit protected against external interference by its own security functions.\"\nPCA Cyber Security told BleepingComputer that last month they confirmed PerfektBlue at a fourth OEM in the automotive industry, who said that OpenSynergy hadn't informed them of the issues.\n\"We decided not to disclose this OEM because there was not enough time for them to react,\" the researchers told us.\n\"We plan to disclose the details about this affected OEM as well as the full technical details of PerfektBlue in November 2025, in the format of a conference talk.\"\nBleepingComputer has also contacted OpenSynergy to inquire about the impact PerfektBlue has on its customers and how many are affected but we have not received a reply at publishing time.\n8 Common Threats in 2025\nWhile cloud attacks may be growing more sophisticated, attackers still succeed with surprisingly simple techniques.\nDrawing from Wiz's detections across thousands of organizations, this report reveals 8 key techniques used by cloud-fluent threat actors.\nGet the Report\nRelated Articles:\nSitecore CMS exploit chain starts with hardcoded 'b' password\nBeyondTrust warns of pre-auth RCE in Remote Support software\nNew Veeam RCE flaw lets domain users hack backup servers\nTrend Micro fixes critical vulnerabilities in multiple products\nHacker selling critical Roundcube webmail exploit as tech info disclosed"

        "Content": "Imagine your organization has just won a contract to handle sensitive law-enforcement data – you might be a cloud provider, a software vendor, or an analytics firm. It won’t be long before CJIS is top of mind.\nYou know the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Security Policy governs how criminal histories, fingerprints, and investigation files must be protected, but beyond that, it all feels a bit opaque.\nWhether you’re a veteran security pro or new to the world of criminal-justice data, understanding CJIS compliance is critical. We’ll start by exploring the origin and\npurpose of CJIS\n: why it exists, and why it matters to every organization that comes anywhere near criminal-justice information.\nThen we’ll pay special attention to the pillars of identity (passwords, multifactor authentication, and strict access controls) and how to embed those controls seamlessly into your environment.\nWhat is CJIS?\nCJIS traces its roots to the late 1990s, when the FBI consolidated various state and local criminal databases into a single, nationwide system. Today, it serves as the nerve center for sharing biometric data, criminal histories, and tactical intelligence across federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.\nAt its core, the CJIS Security Policy exists to ensure that every party touching this data (government or private contractor alike) adheres to a uniform standard of security. When you think “CJIS,” think “unbreakable chain of custody,” from the moment data leaves a patrol car’s mobile terminal until it’s archived in a forensic lab.\nWho needs to comply?\nYou might assume CJIS concerns only police departments, as it’s the FBI’s policy. In reality, the net is much wider:\nLaw-enforcement agencies (SLTF): Every state, local, tribal, and federal agency that stores or queries criminal-justice information.\nThird-Party Vendors and Integrators: If your software ingests, processes, or stores CJIS data (records-management systems, background-check services, cloud-hosting providers) you fall under the policy’s umbrella.\nMulti-jurisdictional task forces: Even temporary coalitions sharing access across different agencies must comply for the duration of their collaboration.\nBottom line: if your systems ever see fingerprints, rap sheets, or dispatch logs, CJIS applies.\nSecure your Active Directory passwords with Specops Password Policy\nVerizon’s Data Breach Investigation Report found stolen credentials are involved in 44.7% of breaches.\nEffortlessly secure Active Directory with compliant password policies, blocking 4+ billion compromised passwords, boosting security, and slashing support hassles!\nTry it for free\nKey requirements\nCJIS touches many domains (physical security, personnel background checks, incident response) but its beating heart is identity and access management. When the FBI audits your environment, they want to know three things: Who accessed what? How did they prove who they were? And were they allowed to see it? Let’s walk through the story:\nUnique identities & unquestionable accountability:\nEvery individual should have their own user ID. Generic or shared accounts are forbidden. This helps with tracing actions back to specific people.\nStrong passwords\n: CJIS calls for at least 12-character passwords, blending uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. However, at Specops we recommend going further and\nenforcing 16+ character passphrases\n. CJIS also requires you to enforce history (no reusing the last 24 passwords) and lock out accounts after no more than five failed attempts.\nMFA as another layer of defense:\nA password alone is no longer sufficient. CJIS requires\ntwo factors\nfor any non-console access: something you know (your password) plus something you have (a hardware token, phone authenticator, etc.). By separating those factors, you dramatically\nreduce the risk of compromised credentials\n.\nLeast privilege and quarterly recertifications:\nGrant only the permissions each user needs to do their job, and no more. Then, every 90 days, pull together your system owners and review who still needs what access. Users change roles, projects end, and inactive accounts accumulate risk.\nAudit trails and immutable logs:\nLogging every authentication event, privilege change, and data query is non-negotiable. CJIS mandates at least 90 days of on-site log retention, plus one year off-site. That way, if you need to reconstruct an incident or answer an auditor’s question, your logs tell the full story without gaps.\nEncryption and network segmentation:\nData must travel and rest under a cloak of FIPS-validated cryptography: TLS 1.2+ for in-flight data, AES-256 for storage. Beyond encryption, segregate your CJIS environment from the rest of your corporate network. Firewalls, VLANs, or air-gapped enclaves keep your most sensitive systems insulated from everyday operations.\nConsequences of non-compliance\nPicture this: a breached set of credentials leaves a CJIS database open to the internet. A hacker exploits it, meaning fingerprints and criminal histories of thousands are compromised overnight.\nThe fallout is swift:\nCJIS access suspended:\nThe FBI can yank your agency’s connection, halting investigations.\nRegulatory scrutiny & fines:\nState and federal bodies may levy penalties, and civil suits can follow.\nReputational damage:\nNews of a breach erodes public trust in your company’s capabilities.\nGet CJIS right with third party tools\nCompliance isn’t just about ticking boxes. it’s about embedding security deeply into your processes, so you can prove it at audit time and fend off attacks day to day.\nHere’s how Specops can simplify your CJIS journey:\nSpecops Password Policy\nmakes it simple to enforce a strong password policy. It embeds CJIS-approved complexity, rotation, and history rules directly in Active Directory. Your Active Directory will also be continuously scanned against a database of 4 billion compromised passwords, notifying end users with breached passwords to immediately change.\nSpecops Secure Access\nelevates your MFA game with authentication factors that are less resistant for social engineering and phishing.\nSpecops uReset\ngives users a self-service portal (protected by MFA) to unlock their AD accounts securely. Every reset is logged, timestamped, and reportable, ticking the audit-trail box without a mountain of help-desk tickets.\nThese solutions share a common theme: they dovetail with your existing Active Directory estate, minimize administrative overhead, and give you clear, auditable evidence of CJIS-compliant controls.\nWant to know Specops products could fit in with your organization?\nGet in touch and we’ll arrange a demo\n.\nSponsored and written by\nSpecops Software\n."

        "Content": "The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested four people suspected of being involved in cyberattacks on major retailers in the country, including Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and Harrods.\nThe arrested individuals are two 19-year-old males, one 17-year-old male, and a 20-year-old female, who were apprehended earlier today in their homes in London and the West Midlands. One of them is Latvian, and the rest are English.\nThe police also confiscated electronic devices to examine them for potential incriminating evidence or information that might lead to co-conspirators.\nThe four suspects now face charges of Computer Misuse Act offenses, blackmail, money laundering, and participation in organized crime.\nThe suspects are believed to be linked to cyberattacks on M&S, Co-op, and Harrods between late April and early May, causing\nmassive disruptions\nand\na negative impact\non the\nbusinesses targeted by the hackers\n.\nMarks & Spencer had to\npause online orders\nsoon after the attack, and later\nconfirmed that customer data had been stolen\n, forcing password resets for all customers. It was later estimated that the incident would\ncause a $402,000,000 (£300 million) impact\non its profits.\nDuring the attacks on Co-op and Marks & Spencer, the threat actors attempted to deploy the\nDragonForce ransomware\n. However, the ransomware attack was only successful on M&S, as Co-op shut down its systems before the encryptors could be deployed.\nAs first reported by BleepingComputer, the cyberattacks were\nattributed to threat actors classified as Scattered Spider\n, with associated hackers tied to numerous breaches over the past few years, including\nMGM\n,\nTwilio\n,\nCoinbase\n,\nDoorDash\n,\nCaesars\n,\nMailChimp\n,\nRiot Games\n, and\nReddit\n.\n\"Since these attacks took place, specialist NCA cybercrime investigators have been working at pace and the investigation remains one of the Agency's highest priorities,\"\nstated NCA's Deputy Director, Paul Foster\n.\n\"Today's arrests are a significant step in that investigation, but our work continues, alongside partners in the UK and overseas, to ensure those responsible are identified and brought to justice.\"\nAlthough the NCA did not mention Scattered Spider in its announcement, the ethnicity,\nsocial engineering tactics\n, and ages of the arrested individuals match the typical profile of Scattered Spider members, as has been established from previous\narrests in the US\n,\nBritain\n, and\nSpain\n.\nAfter targeting retail, the focus of the attackers shifted to\nU.S. insurance companies\n, and later to\naviation and transportation firms\n, also suspected of being behind the\nQantas breach\n.\nQantas confirmed yesterday that the incident impacted\n5.7 million customers\n, exposing their sensitive information.\nThe arrests in Britain could have a chilling effect on Scattered Spiders' ongoing campaigns, as remaining members may choose to pause and go into hiding for a while.\nHowever, as these threat actors are believed to be part of a larger collective of diverse English-speaking threat actors that congregate on Discord, Telegram, and online forums, it is unlikely to cause a complete halt to attacks.\n8 Common Threats in 2025\nWhile cloud attacks may be growing more sophisticated, attackers still succeed with surprisingly simple techniques.\nDrawing from Wiz's detections across thousands of organizations, this report reveals 8 key techniques used by cloud-fluent threat actors.\nGet the Report\nRelated Articles:\nService desks are under attack: What can you do about it?\nM&S confirms social engineering led to massive ransomware attack\nUS disrupts North Korean IT worker \"laptop farm\" scheme in 16 states\nEuropol helps disrupt $540 million crypto investment fraud ring\nRyuk ransomware’s initial access expert extradited to the U.S."

        "Summary": "Authorities in the United Kingdom this week arrested four alleged members of \"Scattered Spider,\" a prolific data theft and extortion group whose recent victims include multiple airlines and the U.K. retail chain Marks &#038; Spencer.",
        "Date": "2025-07-10",
        "Content": "Authorities in the United Kingdom this week arrested four people aged 17 to 20 in connection with recent data theft and extortion attacks against the retailers Marks & Spencer and Harrods, and the British food retailer Co-op Group. The breaches have been linked to a prolific but loosely-affiliated cybercrime group dubbed “Scattered Spider,” whose other recent victims include multiple airlines.\nThe U.K.’s National Crime Agency (NCA) declined verify the names of those arrested, saying only that they included two males aged 19, another aged 17, and 20-year-old female.\nScattered Spider is the name given to an English-speaking cybercrime group known for using social engineering tactics to break into companies and steal data for ransom, often impersonating employees or contractors to deceive IT help desks into granting access. The FBI warned last month that Scattered Spider had recently shifted to targeting companies in the retail and airline sectors.\nKrebsOnSecurity has learned the identities of two of the suspects. Multiple sources close to the investigation said those arrested include Owen David Flowers, a U.K. man alleged to have been involved in the cyber intrusion and ransomware attack that shut down several MGM Casino properties in September 2023. Those same sources said the woman arrested is or recently was in a relationship with Flowers.\nSources told KrebsOnSecurity that Flowers, who allegedly went by the hacker handles “bo764,” “Holy,” and “Nazi,” was the group member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the MGM hack. His real name was omitted from a September 2024 story about the group because he was not yet charged in that incident.\nThe bigger fish arrested this week is 19-year-old Thalha Jubair, a U.K. man whose alleged exploits under various monikers have been well-documented in stories on this site. Jubair is believed to have used the nickname “Earth2Star,” which corresponds to a founding member of the cybercrime-focused Telegram channel “Star Fraud Chat.”\nIn 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published an investigation into the work of three different SIM-swapping groups that phished credentials from T-Mobile employees and used that access to offer a service whereby any T-Mobile phone number could be swapped to a new device. Star Chat was by far the most active and consequential of the three SIM-swapping groups, who collectively broke into T-Mobile’s network more than 100 times in the second half of 2022.\nJubair allegedly used the handles “Earth2Star” and “Star Ace,” and was a core member of a prolific SIM-swapping group operating in 2022. Star Ace posted this image to the Star Fraud chat channel on Telegram, and it lists various prices for SIM-swaps.\nSources tell KrebsOnSecurity that Jubair also was a core member of the LAPSUS$ cybercrime group that broke into dozens of technology companies in 2022, stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants including Microsoft, Nvidia, Okta, Rockstar Games, Samsung, T-Mobile, and Uber.\nIn April 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published internal chat records from LAPSUS$, and those chats indicated Jubair was using the nicknames Amtrak and Asyntax. At one point in the chats, Amtrak told the LAPSUS$ group leader not to share T-Mobile’s logo in images sent to the group because he’d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.\nAs shown in those chats, the leader of LAPSUS$ eventually decided to betray Amtrak by posting his real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram.\nIn March 2022, the leader of the LAPSUS$ data extortion group exposed Thalha Jubair’s name and hacker handles in a public chat room on Telegram.\nThat story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats connected Amtrak/Asyntax/Jubair to the identity “Everlynn,” the founder of a cybercriminal service that sold fraudulent “emergency data requests” targeting the major social media and email providers. In such schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data while claiming the information being requested can’t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.\nThe roster of the now-defunct “Infinity Recursion” hacking team, from which some member of LAPSUS$ hail.\nSources say Jubair also used the nickname “Operator,” and that until recently he was the administrator of the Doxbin, a long-running and highly toxic online community that is used to “dox” or post deeply personal information on people. In May 2024, several popular cybercrime channels on Telegram ridiculed Operator after it was revealed that he’d staged his own kidnapping in a botched plan to throw off law enforcement investigators.\nIn November 2024, U.S. authorities charged five men aged 20 to 25 in connection with the Scattered Spider group, which has long relied on recruiting minors to carry out its most risky activities. Indeed, many of the group’s core members were recruited from online gaming platforms like Roblox and Minecraft in their early teens, and have been perfecting their social engineering tactics for years.\n“There is a clear pattern that some of the most depraved threat actors first joined cybercrime gangs at an exceptionally young age,” said Allison Nixon, chief research officer at the New York based security firm Unit 221B. “Cybercriminals arrested at 15 or younger need serious intervention and monitoring to prevent a years long massive escalation.”\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Thursday 10th of July 2025 01:31 PM \r\n         \njared antwon aka bo764 owned 764 in past he must stand charges related to child grooming as well, they sized his laptop but never inspected it, it contains recordings of his crimes also contains recordings of crimes of his team mates, including extortions of minors (including individuals who go by soldier of christ/light yagami/comfy/cloak/hibari and poodle)\ndidnt jared cuckwon also social engineer his way with operator, convict and reiko (valhal.la) into “orange” the romanian mobile services provider\nHigh greed, low fear of getting caught = recipe for disaster because the chances of getting caught increase over time.  So many get caught, so few get away with it.\nI heard that a person named Raven from a group known as Blood Council based in Barking & Dagenham was involved in some of the scattered spider attacks and lone attacks to children’s health care facilities\nYeah. Heard some stuff about this ‘Convict 764’ guy, real name Baron Martin. Really active dude within the ransomware scene apparently, got arrested earlier this year for CSAM. I know he’s been affiliated with a few threat actors before, but I wouldn’t ever think for him to be affiliated with Scattered Spider, this is pretty insane. I guess it does make sense as he was friends with Starfall Reiko who was involved in hacking Lenovo. Must’ve met some of Reiko’s friends and got involved in that space\nthis sounds legit\nmy name is javin antwon and I worked with operator, but I am smoking operator pack right now, please contact me on telegram if you need more intel on their attacks:  @weback1257\nP.s idc about hiding my face, i hope you all like my kenzo shirt https://i.imgur.com/XSHSqyK.jpeg\nYour email address will not be published.
