        "Content": "Threat actors with ties to North Korea have been observed targeting Web3 and cryptocurrency-related businesses with malware written in the Nim programming language, underscoring a constant evolution of their tactics.\n\"Unusually for macOS malware, the threat actors employ a process injection technique and remote communications via wss, the TLS-encrypted version of the WebSocket protocol,\" SentinelOne researchers Phil Stokes and Raffaele Sabato\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\"A novel persistence mechanism takes advantage of SIGINT/SIGTERM signal handlers to install persistence when the malware is terminated or the system rebooted.\"\nThe cybersecurity company is tracking the malware components collectively under the name NimDoor. It's worth noting that some aspects of the campaign were previously documented by\nHuntabil.IT\nand later by\nHuntress\nand\nValidin\n, but with differences in the payloads deployed.\nThe attack chains involve social engineering tactics, approaching targets on messaging platforms like Telegram to schedule a Zoom meeting via Calendly, an appointment scheduling software. The target is then sent an email containing a supposed Zoom meeting link along with instructions to run a Zoom SDK update script to ensure that they are running the latest version of the videoconferencing software.\nThis step results in the execution of an AppleScript that acts as a delivery vehicle for a second-stage script from a remote server, while ostensibly redirecting the user to a legitimate Zoom redirect link. The newly downloaded script subsequently unpacks ZIP archives containing binaries that are responsible for setting up persistence and launching information stealing bash scripts.\nAt the heart of the infection sequence is a C++ loader called InjectWithDyldArm64 (aka InjectWithDyld), which decrypts two embedded binaries named Target and trojan1_arm64. InjectWithDyldArm64 launches Target in a suspended state and injects into it the trojan1_arm64's binary's code, after which the execution of the suspended process is resumed.\nThe malware proceeds to establish communication with a remote server and fetch commands that allow it to gather system information, run arbitrary commands, and change or set the current working directory. The results of the execution are sent back to the server.\nTrojan1_arm64, for its part, is capable of downloading two more payloads, which come fitted with capabilities to harvest credentials from web browsers like Arc, Brave, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox, as well as extract data from the Telegram application.\nAlso dropped as part of the attacks is a collection of Nim-based executable that are used as a launchpad for CoreKitAgent, which monitors for user attempts to kill the malware process and ensures persistence.\n\"This behavior ensures that any user-initiated termination of the malware results in the deployment of the core components, making the code resilient to basic defensive actions,\" the researchers said.\nThe malware also launches an AppleScript that beacons out every 30 seconds to one of two hard-coded command-and-control (C2) servers, while also exfiltrating a snapshot of the list of running processes and executing additional scripts sent by the server.\nThe findings demonstrate how North Korean threat actors are increasingly training their sights on macOS systems, weaponizing AppleScript to act as a post-exploitation backdoor to meet their data gathering goals.\n\"North Korean-aligned threat actors have previously experimented with Go and Rust, similarly combining scripts and compiled binaries into multi-stage attack chains,\" the researchers said.\n\"However, Nim's rather unique ability to execute functions during compile time allows attackers to blend complex behaviour into a binary with less obvious control flow, resulting in compiled binaries in which developer code and Nim runtime code are intermingled even at the function level.\"\nKimsuky's Use of ClickFix Continues\nThe disclosure comes as South Korean cybersecurity company Genians\nexposed\nKimusky's continued use of the\nClickFix social engineering tactic\nto deliver a variety of remote access tools as part of a campaign dubbed\nBabyShark\n, a known cluster of activity attributed to the North Korean hacking group.\nThe attacks, first observed in January 2025 and targeting national security experts in South Korea, involve the use of spear-phishing emails masquerading as interview requests for a legitimate German-language business newspaper and trick them into opening a malicious link containing a bogus RAR archive.\nPresent within the archive is a Visual Basic Script (VBS) file that's engineered to open a decoy Google Docs file in the user's web browser, while, in the background, malicious code is executed to establish persistence on the host via scheduled tasks and harvest system information.\nSubsequent attacks observed in March 2025 have impersonated a senior U.S. national security official to deceive targets into opening a PDF attachment that included a list of questions related to a meeting during the official's purported visit to South Korea.\n\"They also tried to trick the target into opening a manual and entering an authentication code, supposedly required to access a secure document,\" Genians said. \"While the original 'ClickFix' tactic tricked users into clicking to fix a specific error, this variant modified the approach by prompting users to copy and paste an authentication code to access a secure document.\"\nA similar tactic was\ndocumented\nby Proofpoint in April 2025, the difference being that the email message claimed to originate from a Japanese diplomat and urged the recipient to set up a meeting with the Japanese ambassador to the United States.\nOnce the obfuscated malicious PowerShell command is executed, a decoy Google Docs file is used as a distraction to conceal the execution of malicious code that establishes persistent communication with a C2 server to collect data and deliver additional payloads.\nA second variant of the ClickFix strategy entails using a fake website mimicking a legitimate defense research job portal and populating it with bogus listings, causing site visitors who click on these postings to be served with a ClickFix-style pop-up message to open the Windows Run dialog and run a PowerShell command.\nThe command, for its part, guided users to download and install the Chrome Remote Desktop software on their systems, enabling remote control over SSH via the C2 server \"kida.plusdocs.kro[.]kr.\" Genians said it discovered a directory listing vulnerability in the C2 server that publicly exposed data likely collected from victims located across South Korea.\nThe C2 server also included an IP address from China, which has been found to contain a keylogging record for a Proton Drive link hosting a ZIP archive that's used to drop BabyShark malware on the infected Windows host by means of a multi-stage attack chain.\nAs recently as last month, Kimsuky is believed to have concocted yet another variant of ClickFix in which the threat actors deploy phony Naver CAPTCHA verification pages to copy and paste PowerShell commands into the Windows Run dialog that launches an AutoIt script to siphon user information.\n\"The 'BabyShark' campaign is known for its swift adoption of new attack techniques, often integrating them with script-based mechanisms,\" the company said. \"The 'ClickFix' tactic discussed in this report appears to be another case of publicly available methods being adapted for malicious use.\"\nIn recent weeks, Kimsuky has also been linked to email phishing campaigns that seemingly originate from academic institutions, but distribute malware under the pretext of reviewing a research paper.\n\"The email prompted the recipient to open a HWP document file with a malicious OLE object attachment,\" AhnLab\nsaid\n. \"The document was password-protected, and the recipient had to enter the password provided in the email body to view the document.\"\nOpening the weaponized document activates the infection process, leading to the execution of a PowerShell script that performs extensive system reconnaissance and the deployment of the legitimate AnyDesk software for persistent remote access.\nThe prolific threat actor that Kimsuky is, the group is in a constant state of flux regarding its tools, tactics, and techniques for malware delivery, with some of the cyber attacks also leveraging GitHub as a stager for propagating an open-source trojan called\nXeno RAT\n.\n\"The malware accesses the attacker's private repositories using a hard-coded Github Personal Access Token (PAT),\" ENKI WhiteHat\nsaid\n. \"This token was used to download malware from a private repository and upload information collected from victim systems.\"\nAccording to the South Korean cybersecurity vendor, the attacks begin with spear-phishing emails with compressed archive attachments containing a Windows shortcut (LNK) file, which, in turn, is likely used to drop a PowerShell script that then downloads and launches the decoy document, as well as executes Xeno RAT and a PowerShell information stealer.\nOther attack sequences have been found to utilize a PowerShell-based downloader that fetches a file with an RTF extension from Dropbox to ultimately launch Xeno RAT. The campaign shares infrastructure overlaps with another set of attacks that delivered a variant of Xeno RAT known as\nMoonPeak\n.\n\"The attacker managed not only the malware used in attacks but also uploaded and maintained infected system log files and exfiltrated information in private repositories using GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs),\" ENKI noted. \"This ongoing activity highlights the persistent and evolving nature of Kimsuky's operations, including their use of both GitHub and Dropbox as part of their infrastructure.\"\nKimsuky, per\ndata\nfrom NSFOCUS, has been one of the most active threat groups from Korea, alongside\nKonni\n, accounting for 5% of all the 44 advanced persistent threat (APT) activities recorded by the Chinese cybersecurity company in May 2025. In\ncomparison\n, the top three most active APT groups in April were Kimsuky,\nSidewinder\n, and Konni.\nFound this article interesting?

        "Content": "With nearly 80% of cyber threats now mimicking legitimate user behavior, how are top SOCs determining what's legitimate traffic and what is potentially dangerous?\nWhere do you turn when firewalls and endpoint detection and response (EDR) fall short at detecting the most important threats to your organization? Breaches at edge devices and VPN gateways have risen from 3% to 22%, according to Verizon's latest Data Breach Investigations report. EDR solutions are struggling to catch zero-day exploits, living-off-the-land techniques, and malware-free attacks. Nearly 80% of detected threats use malware-free techniques that mimic normal user behavior, as highlighted in CrowdStrike's 2025 Global Threat Report. The stark reality is that conventional detection methods are no longer sufficient as threat actors adapt their strategies, using clever techniques like credential theft or DLL hijacking to avoid discovery.\nIn response, security operations centers (SOCs) are turning to a\nmulti-layered detection\napproach that uses network data to expose activity adversaries can't conceal.\nTechnologies like network detection and response (NDR) are being adopted to provide visibility that complements EDR by exposing behaviors that are more likely to be missed by endpoint-based solutions. Unlike EDR, NDR operates without agent deployment, so it effectively identifies threats that use common techniques and legitimate tools maliciously. The bottom line is evasive techniques that work against edge devices and EDR are less likely to succeed when NDR is also on the lookout.\nLayering up: The faster threat detection strategy\nMuch like layering for unpredictable weather, elite SOCs boost resilience through a multi-layered detection strategy centered on network insights. By consolidating detections into a single system, NDR streamlines management and empowers teams to focus on high-priority risks and use cases.\nTeams can adapt quickly to evolving attack conditions, detect threats faster, and minimize damage. Now, let's gear up and take a closer look at the layers that make up this dynamic stack:\nTHE BASE LAYER\nLightweight and quick to apply, these easily catch known threats to form the basis for defense:\nSignature-based network detection\nserves as the first layer of protection due to its lightweight nature and quick response times. Industry-leading signatures, such as those from Proofpoint ET Pro running on Suricata engines, can rapidly identify known threats and attack patterns.\nThreat intelligence\n,\noften composed of indicators of compromise (IOCs), looks for known network entities (e.g., IP addresses, domain names, hashes) observed in actual attacks. As with signatures, IOCs are easy to share, light-weight, and quick to deploy, offering quicker detection.\nTHE MALWARE LAYER\nThink of\nmalware detection\nas a waterproof barrier, protecting against \"drops\" of malware payloads by identifying malware families. Detections such as YARA rules — a standard for static file analysis in the malware analysis community — can identify malware families sharing common code structures. It's crucial for detecting polymorphic malware that alters its signature while retaining core behavioral characteristics.\nTHE ADAPTIVE LAYER\nBuilt to weather evolving conditions, the most sophisticated layers use behavioral detection and machine learning algorithms that identify known, unknown, and evasive threats:\nBehavioral detection\nidentifies dangerous activities like domain generation algorithms (DGAs), command and control communications, and unusual data exfiltration patterns. It remains effective even when attackers change their IOCs (or even components of the attack), since the underlying behaviors don't change, enabling quicker detection of unknown threats.\nML\nmodels, both supervised and unsupervised, can detect both known attack patterns and anomalous behaviors that might indicate novel threats. They can target attacks that span greater lengths of time and complexity than behavioral detections.\nAnomaly detection\nuses unsupervised machine learning to spot deviations from baseline network behavior. This alerts SOCs to anomalies like unexpected services, unusual client software, suspicious logins, and malicious management traffic. It helps organizations uncover threats hiding in normal network activity and minimize attacker dwell time.\nTHE QUERY LAYER\nFinally, in some situations, there is simply no faster way to generate an alert than to query the existing network data.\nSearch-based detection\n—\nlog search queries that generate alerts and detections — functions like a snap-on layer that's at the ready for short-term, rapid response.\nUnifying threat detection layers with NDR\nThe true strength in multi-layered detections is how they work together. Top SOCs are deploying Network Detection and Response (NDR) to provide a unified view of threats across the network. NDR correlates detections from multiple engines to deliver a complete threat view, centralized network visibility, and the context that powers real-time incident response.\nBeyond layered detections,\nadvanced NDR solutions\ncan also offer several key advantages that enhance overall threat response capabilities:\nDetecting emerging attack vectors and novel techniques that haven't yet been incorporated into traditional EDR signature-based detection systems.\nReducing false positive rates by ~25%, according to a 2022 FireEye report\nCutting incident response times with AI-driven triage and automated workflows\nComprehensive coverage of MITRE ATT&CK network-based tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs)\nLeveraging shared intelligence and community-driven detections (open-source solutions)\nThe path forward for modern SOCs\nThe combination of increasingly sophisticated attacks, expanding attack surfaces, and added resource constraints requires a shift toward multi-layered detection strategies. In an environment where attacks succeed in seconds, the window for maintaining effective cybersecurity without an NDR solution is rapidly closing.\nElite SOC teams get this\nand have already layered up. The question isn't whether to implement multi-layered detection, it's how quickly organizations can make this transition.\nCorelight Network Detection and Response\nCorelight's integrated Open NDR Platform combines all seven of the network detection types mentioned above and is built on a foundation of open-source software like Zeek®, allowing you to tap into the power of community-driven detection intelligence.

        "Content": "Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to phishing campaigns that impersonate popular brands and trick targets into calling phone numbers operated by threat actors.\n\"A significant portion of email threats with PDF payloads persuade victims to call adversary-controlled phone numbers, displaying another popular social engineering technique known as Telephone-Oriented Attack Delivery (TOAD), also known as callback phishing,\" Cisco Talos researcher Omid Mirzaei\nsaid\nin a report shared with The Hacker News.\nAn analysis of phishing emails with PDF attachments between May 5 and June 5, 2025, has revealed Microsoft and Docusign to be the most impersonated brands. NortonLifeLock, PayPal, and Geek Squad are among the most impersonated brands in TOAD emails with PDF attachments.\nThe activity is part of wider phishing attacks that attempt to leverage the trust people have with popular brands to initiate malicious actions. These messages typically incorporate PDF attachments featuring legitimate brands like Adobe and Microsoft to scan malicious QR codes that point to fake Microsoft login pages or click on links that redirect users to phishing pages posing as services like Dropbox.\nQR code phishing emails with PDF payloads have also been found to leverage PDF annotations to embed the URLs within a sticky note, comment, or form fields within a PDF attachment, while linking the QR codes to an authentic web page to give the impression that the messages are trustworthy.\nIn TOAD-based attacks, victims are coaxed into calling a phone number in a purported attempt to resolve an issue or confirm a transaction. During the phone call, the attacker masquerades as a legitimate customer representative and tricks the victim into either disclosing sensitive information or installing malware on their devices.\nMost TOAD campaigns rely on the illusion of urgency, but their effectiveness often hinges on how convincingly attackers imitate real support workflows – using scripted call center tactics, hold music, and even spoofed caller IDs.\nThis technique has been a\npopular method\namong\nthreat actors\nto install banking trojans on Android devices and remote access programs on victim machines to gain persistent access. In May 2025, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned of such attacks perpetrated by a financially motivated group called Luna Moth to breach target networks by posing as IT department personnel.\n\"Attackers use direct voice communication to exploit the victim's trust in phone calls and the perception that phone communication is a secure way to interact with an organization,\" Mirzaei said. \"Additionally, the live interaction during a phone call enables attackers to manipulate the victim's emotions and responses by employing social engineering tactics.\"\nCisco Talos said most threat actors use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) numbers to remain anonymous and make it harder to trace, with some numbers reused consecutively for as many as four days, allowing the attackers to pull off multi-stage social engineering attacks using the same number.\n\"Brand impersonation is one of the most\npopular social engineering techniques\n, and it is continuously being used by attackers in different types of email threats,\" the company said. \"Therefore, a brand impersonation detection engine plays a pivotal role in defending against cyber attacks.\"\nIn recent months, phishing campaigns have also capitalized on a legitimate feature in Microsoft 365 (M365) called\nDirect Send\nto spoof internal users and deliver phishing emails without the need for compromising an account. The novel method has been employed to target more than 70 organizations since May 2025, per Varonis.\nThese spoofed messages not only seem to originate from inside the victim organization, they also take advantage of the fact that\nsmart host addresses\nfollow a predictable pattern (\"<tenant_name>.mail.protection.outlook.com\") to send the phishing emails without requiring authentication.\nThis tactic shares similarities with vishing, tech support scams, and business email compromise (BEC), but differs in delivery vector and persistence. While some attackers push victims to download remote access software like AnyDesk or TeamViewer, others route them through fake payment portals or impersonate billing departments to harvest credit card information, broadening the attack surface beyond just credential theft.\nIn one phishing email sent on June 17, 2025, the message body resembled a voicemail notification and included a PDF attachment that contained a QR code directing the recipients to a Microsoft 365 credentials harvesting page.\n\"In many of their initial access attempts, the threat actor utilized M365 Direct Send functionality to target an individual organization with phishing messages that were subject to less scrutiny compared to standard inbound email,\" security researcher Tom Barnea\nsaid\n. \"This simplicity makes Direct Send an attractive and low-effort vector for phishing campaigns.\"\nThe disclosure comes as new research from Netcraft found that asking large language models (LLMs) where to log in to 50 different brands across various sectors like finance, retail, tech, and utilities suggested unrelated hostnames as responses that were not owned by the brands in the first place.\n\"Two-thirds of the time, the model returned the correct URL,\" the company\nsaid\n. \"But in the remaining third, the results broke down like this: nearly 30% of the domains were unregistered, parked, or otherwise inactive, leaving them open to takeover. Another 5% pointed users to completely unrelated businesses.\"\nThis also means that users could be likely sent to a fake website just by asking an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot where to sign in, opening the door for brand impersonation and phishing attacks when threat actors claim control of these unregistered or unrelated domains.\nWith\nthreat actors\nalready\nusing\nAI-powered tools to\ncreate phishing pages\nat scale, the latest development marks a new twist where cybercriminals are looking to game an LLM's response by surfacing malicious URLs as responses to queries.\nNetcraft said it has also observed attempts to poison AI coding assistants like Cursor by publishing fake APIs to GitHub that harbor functionality to route transactions on the Solana blockchain to an attacker-controlled wallet.\n\"The attacker didn't just publish the code,\" security researcher Bilaal Rashid said. \"They launched blog tutorials, forum Q&As, and dozens of GitHub repos to promote it. Multiple fake GitHub accounts shared a project called Moonshot-Volume-Bot, seeded across accounts with rich bios, profile images, social media accounts and credible coding activity. These weren't throwaway accounts – they were crafted to be indexed by AI training pipelines.\"\nThe developments also follow concerted efforts on the part of threat actors to inject reputed websites (e.g., .gov or .edu domains) with JavaScript or HTML designed to influence search engines into prioritizing phishing sites in search results. This is accomplished by an illicit marketplace called Hacklink.\nThe service \"enables cybercriminals to purchase access to thousands of compromised websites and inject malicious code designed to manipulate search engine algorithms,\" security researcher Andrew Sebborn\nsaid\n. \"Scammers use Hacklink control panels to insert links to phishing or illicit websites into the source code of legitimate but compromised domains.\"\nThese outbound links are associated with specific keywords so that the hacked websites are served in search results when users search for relevant terms. To make matters worse, the actors can alter the text that appears in the search result to match their needs without having to take control of the site in question, impacting brand integrity and user trust.\nFound this article interesting?

It also drops other two binaries -\n'GoogIe LLC,' 'CoreKitAgent'\n, onto the victim's system.\nGoogIe LLC takes over to collect environment data and generate a hex-encoded config file, writing it to a temp path. It sets up a macOS LaunchAgent (com.google.update.plist) for persistence, which re-launches GoogIe LLC at login and stores authentication keys for later stages.\nThe most advanced componentused in the attack is\nCoreKitAgent\n, the main payload of the NimDoor framework, which operates as an event-driven binary, using macOS's kqueue mechanism to asynchronously manage execution.\nIt implements a 10-case state machine with a hardcoded state transition table, allowing flexible control flow based on runtime conditions.\nThe most distinctive feature is its signal-based persistence mechanisms, where it installs custom handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM.\nRegistering custom signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM\nSource: SentinelLABS\nThese are signals typically used to terminate processes, but when either is caught, CoreKitAgent triggers a reinstallation routine that re-deploys GoogIe LLC, restoring the persistence chain.\n\"When triggered, CoreKitAgent catches these signals and writes the LaunchAgent for persistence, a copy of GoogIe LLC as the loader, and a copy of itself as the trojan, setting executable permissions on the latter two via the addExecutionPermissions_user95startup95mainZutils_u32 function,\"\nexplains SentinelLABS\n.\n\"This behavior ensures that any user-initiated termination of the malware results in the deployment of the core components, making the code resilient to basic defensive actions.\"\nWriting the malware components back to disk when the process is terminated\nSource: SentinelLABS\nCoreKitAgent decodes and runs a hex-encoded AppleScript that beacons to attacker infrastructure every 30 seconds, exfiltrates system data, and executes remote commands via osascript, providing a lightweight backdoor.\nParallel to the NimDoor execution, '\nzoom_sdk_support.scpt\n' triggers a second injection chain involving '\ntrojan1_arm64\n', which initiates WSS-based C2 communications and downloads two scripts (\nupl\nand\ntlgrm\n) that facilitate data theft.\nIn the case of the 'zoom_sdk_support.scpt' loader, the researchers noticed that it includes more than 10,000 blank lines for obfuscation purposes.\nUpl extracts data from web browsers and grabs Keychain, .bash_history, and .zsh_history, and exfiltrates it using curl to dataupload[.]store.\nTlgrm focuses on stealing the Telegram database along with .tempkeyEncrypted, likely using those to decrypt messages the target exchanged on the platform.\nThe tlgrm script targeting Telegram data\nSource: SentinelLABS\nOverall, the NimDoor framework and the rest of the backdoors SentinelLABS analyzed are soome of the most complex macOS malware families linked to North Korean threat actors.\nThe malware's modularity, which gives it flexibility, and the use of novel techniques like signal-based persistence indicate that DPRK operators evolve their toolkit to extend their cross-platform capabilities.\nSentinelLABS' report includes indicators of compromise for the domains, file paths, scripts, and binaries the North Korean threat actor used in attacks aimed at stealing cryptocurrency assets and sensitive information.\n8 Common Threats in 2025\nWhile cloud attacks may be growing more sophisticated, attackers still succeed with surprisingly simple techniques.\nDrawing from Wiz's detections across thousands of organizations, this report reveals 8 key techniques used by cloud-fluent threat actors.\nGet the Report\nRelated Articles:\nNorth Korean hackers deepfake execs in Zoom call to spread Mac malware\nHackers use fake Ledger apps to steal Mac users’ seed phrases\nU.S. warns of Iranian cyber threats on critical infrastructure\nNew wave of ‘fake interviews’ use 35 npm packages to spread malware\nMalware on Google Play, Apple App Store stole your photos—and crypto"

        "Content": "An ex-ransomware negotiator is under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice for allegedly working with ransomware gangs to profit from extortion payment deals.\nThe suspect is a former employee of DigitalMint, a Chicago-based incident response and digital asset services company that specializes in ransomware negotiation and facilitating cryptocurrency payments to receive a decryptor or prevent stolen data from being publicly released. The company claims to have conducted over 2,000 ransomware negotiations since 2017.\nBloomberg\nfirst reported\nthat the DOJ is investigating whether the suspect worked with ransomware gangs to negotiate payments, then allegedly received a cut of the ransom that was charged to the customer.\nDigitalMint confirmed that one of its former employees is under criminal investigation and informed BleepingComputer that it terminated the employee after learning of the alleged conduct. The company says that it is not the target of the investigation.\n\"We acted swiftly to protect our clients and have been cooperating with law enforcement,\" said Jonathan Solomon, CEO of DigitalMint, in a statement shared with BleepingComputer.\n\"Trust is earned every day. As soon as we were able, we began communicating the facts to affected stakeholders,\" added Marc Grens, DigitalMint's president.\nDigitalMint would not respond to further questions from BleepingComputer, such as whether the suspect had been arrested, citing that the investigation was still ongoing.\nSome law and insurance firms have reportedly warned clients this week against using DigitalMint while the investigation is ongoing.\nThe DOJ declined to comment when Bloomberg contacted them earlier this week. BleepingComputer also contacted the FBI to confirm the story, but they also declined to comment.\nProfiting from crime\nA\n2019 report by ProPublica\nrevealed that some U.S. data recovery firms were found to secretly pay ransomware gangs while charging clients for data restoration services, without disclosing that payments were made to the attackers.\nThese ransomware payments, though, were significantly lower, ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands, compared to the\nmulti-million-dollar ransom payments\nthat companies make today.\nSome ransomware operations, such as GandCrab and REvil,\ncreated special discount codes and chat interfaces\nspecifically designed for these types of firms to receive a discount on the ransom demand.\nBill Siegel, CEO of ransomware negotiation firm Coveware, told BleepingComputer that business models that do not utilize a fixed-fee structure lend themselves to this type of potential abuse.\n\"Business models that are financially incentivized towards larger transaction volume and higher transaction size do NOT fit within the incident response industry,\" Siegel told BleepingComputer.\n\"This moral hazard has been present for years and has manifested itself several times, but it's always the same underlying issue. If an intermediary earns a large fixed percentage of a ransom, objective advice is not going to follow.\"\nSiegel further states that paying a ransom demand is often the wrong decision for any company, which can be challenging to communicate to a company dealing with a ransomware attack.\n8 Common Threats in 2025\nWhile cloud attacks may be growing more sophisticated, attackers still succeed with surprisingly simple techniques.\nDrawing from Wiz's detections across thousands of organizations, this report reveals 8 key techniques used by cloud-fluent threat actors.\nGet the Report\nRelated Articles:\nAnubis ransomware adds wiper to destroy files beyond recovery\nIranian pleads guilty to RobbinHood ransomware attacks, faces 30 years\nPowerSchool hacker pleads guilty to student data extortion scheme\nJohnson Controls starts notifying people affected by 2023 breach\nU.S. warns of Iranian cyber threats on critical infrastructure"

It impacts all versions of Forminator up to 1.44.2.\nForminator Forms is a plugin developed by WPMU DEV. It offers a flexible, visual drag‑and‑drop builder to help users create and embed a wide range of form-based content on WordPress sites.\nAccording to statistics from\nWordPress.org\n, the plugin is currently active on more than 600,000 websites.\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient validation and sanitization of form field input and unsafe file deletion logic in the plugin’s backend code.\nWhen a user submits a form, the ‘save_entry_fields()’ function saves all field values, including file paths, without checking if those fields are supposed to handle files.\nAn attacker could exploit this behavior to insert a crafted file array into any field, including text fields, mimicking an uploaded file with a custom path that points to a critical file, such as ‘/var/www/html/wp-config.php.’\nWhen the admin deletes this or when the plugin auto-deletes old submissions (as configured), Forminator wipes the core WordPress file, forcing the website to enter a “setup” stage where it’s vulnerable to takeover.\n“Deleting wp-config.php forces the site into a setup state, allowing an attacker to initiate a site takeover by connecting it to a database under their control,”\nexplains Wordfence\n.\nDiscovery and patching\nCVE-20256463 was discovered by security researcher ‘Phat RiO – BlueRock’ who reported it to Wordfence on June 20 and received a bug bounty of $8,100.\nFollowing internal validation of the exploit, Wordfence contacted WPMU DEV on June 23, who acknowledged the report and started working on a fix.\nOn June 30, the vendor released Forminator version 1.44.3, which adds a field type check and a file path validation that ensures deletions are limited to the WordPress uploads directory.\nSince the release of the patch, there have been 200,000 downloads but it is unclear how many are currently vulnerable to CVE-2025-6463 exploitation.\nIf you use Forminator for your website, it is recommended to update it to the latest version or deactivate the plugin until you can move to a safe version.\nAt this time, there are no reports about active exploitation of CVE-2025-6463, but the public disclosure of the technical details combined with the ease of exploitation could lead to threat actors moving quickly to exploring its potential in attacks.\n8 Common Threats in 2025\nWhile cloud attacks may be growing more sophisticated, attackers still succeed with surprisingly simple techniques.\nDrawing from Wiz's detections across thousands of organizations, this report reveals 8 key techniques used by cloud-fluent threat actors.\nGet the Report\nRelated Articles:\nLinux Foundation unveils decentralized WordPress plugin manager\nWordPress Motors theme flaw mass-exploited to hijack admin accounts\nPremium WordPress 'Motors' theme vulnerable to admin takeover attacks\nHackers exploit OttoKit WordPress plugin flaw to add admin accounts"

This OTP message allows them to view the encrypted email on the Office 365 Message Encryption portal.\nHowever, as the company explains in a new\nservice alert\npublished in the admin center, some users may not receive OTP emails because of a known Domain Name System (DNS) record misconfiguration.\n\"Some users expecting to receive OTP email messages for encrypted email messages in Exchange Online may be impacted,\" Microsoft said.\n\"DNS records for the domain that provides OTP email messages to encrypted messages became misconfigured, which is causing impact. We've corrected the DNS record configurations for the affected domain and are reaching out to a sample of affected users to confirm whether the impact is remediated.\"\nIn a previous update regarding this incident, Microsoft noted that the OTP delivery problems are due to the removal of DNS records for the domain that generates access codes for encrypted messages.\nIt also added that the known issue specifically affects users who have a process set up to perform DNS checks on incoming email messages.\nWhile Microsoft has yet to provide detailed information about the extent of the incident, the company has identified it as a critical service issue in the Microsoft 365 admin center, indicating that it has a significant impact on users.\nIn February, Microsoft resolved a\nwidespread issue causing Entra ID DNS authentication failures\n, which were triggered by a DNS change that resulted in DNS resolution failures for the autologon.microsoftazuread.sso.com domain.\nIn recent years, Microsoft has had to address outages and incidents caused by DNS issues, including one in August 2023 that was triggered by a misconfigured DNS SPF record, resulting in worldwide\nHotmail email delivery failures\n.\nTwo years earlier, in April 2021, a code defect was responsible for a\nglobal outage that affected many Microsoft services\ndue to overloaded Azure DNS servers.\n8 Common Threats in 2025\nWhile cloud attacks may be growing more sophisticated, attackers still succeed with surprisingly simple techniques.\nDrawing from Wiz's detections across thousands of organizations, this report reveals 8 key techniques used by cloud-fluent threat actors.\nGet the Report\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft fixes Outlook bug causing crashes when opening emails\nMicrosoft shares temp fix for Outlook crashes when opening emails\nMicrosoft Defender for Office 365 now blocks email bombing attacks\nMicrosoft fixes ‘Print to PDF’ feature broken by Windows update\nMicrosoft fixes known issue that breaks Windows 11 updates"

        "Summary": "Australian airline Qantas disclosed that it detected a cyberattack on Monday after threat actors gained access to a third-party platform containing customer data. [...]",
        "Date": "2025-07-02",
        "Content": "Australian airline Qantas disclosed that it detected a cyberattack on Monday after threat actors gained access to a third-party platform containing customer data.\nQantas is Australia's largest airline, operating domestic and international flights across six continents and employing around 24,000 people.\nIn a press release issued Monday night, the airline states that the attack has been contained, but a \"significant\" amount of data is believed to have been stolen. The breach began after a threat actor targeted a Qantas call centre and gained access to a third-party customer servicing platform.\n\"On Monday, we detected unusual activity on a third party platform used by a Qantas airline contact centre. We then took immediate steps and contained the system. We can confirm all Qantas systems remain secure,\"\nQantas stated\n.\n\"There are 6 million customers that have service records in this platform. We are continuing to investigate the proportion of the data that has been stolen, though we expect it will be significant. An initial review has confirmed the data includes some customers' names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers.\"\nQantas says no credit card or personal financial information was exposed, and frequent flyer account passwords, PINs, and login details were not impacted.\nAfter detecting the breach, Qantas says it notified the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, and the Australian Federal Police. It's unclear if external cybersecurity experts are assisting with the investigation.\nScattered Spider attacks target aviation firms\nThis attack comes as cybersecurity firms warn that hackers known as \"Scattered Spider\" have\nbegun targeting the aviation and transportation industries\n.\nWhile it is unclear if this group is behind the Qantas attack, BleepingComputer has learned the incident shares similarities with other recent attacks by the threat actors.\nScattered Spider\n(also tracked as\n0ktapus\n,\nUNC3944\n,\nScatter Swine\n, Starfraud, and\nMuddled Libra\n) is a group of threat actors known for their conducting social engineering and identity-based attacks against organizations worldwide, commonly using phishing, SIM swapping, MFA bombing, and help desk phone calls to gain access to employee credentials.\nIn September 2023, they escalated their attacks by breaching\nMGM Resorts\nand encrypting over 100 VMware ESXi hypervisors using BlackCat ransomware after gaining access by impersonating an employee. They've also partnered with other ransomware operations, such as\nRansomHub\n,\nQilin\n, and\nDragonForce\n. Other organizations targeted by Scattered Spider include\nTwilio\n,\nCoinbase\n,\nDoorDash\n,\nCaesars\n,\nMailChimp\n,\nRiot Games\n, and\nReddit\n.\nAfter recently focusing on\nretail\nand\ninsurance companies\n, cybersecurity firms warned on Friday that Scattered Spider had shifted its attention to aviation, with recent\nattacks on Hawaiian Airlines\nand WestJet believed to be linked to the threat actors.\nBleepingComputer has learned that in the\nWestJet breach\n, threat actors exploited a self-service password reset to gain access to an employee's account, which was then used to breach the network.\nThe threat actors have been employing a sector-by-sector approach to their attacks, and it is unclear if they are done with the aviation sector and what industry will be targeted next.\nOrganizations defending against this type of threat should start by gaining complete visibility across the entire infrastructure, identity systems, and critical management services.\nThis includes securing self-service password reset platforms, help desks, and third-party identity vendors, which have become common targets of these threat actors.\nBoth\nGoogle Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\nand\nPalo Alto Networks\nhave released guides on hardening defenses against the\nknown \"Scattered Spider\" tactics\n, which admins should familiarize themselves with.\nOther recent cyberattacks believed to be associated with Scattered Spider include\nM&S\n,\nCo-op\n,\nErie Insurance\n, and\nAflac\n.\n8 Common Threats in 2025\nWhile cloud attacks may be growing more sophisticated, attackers still succeed with surprisingly simple techniques.\nDrawing from Wiz's detections across thousands of organizations, this report reveals 8 key techniques used by cloud-fluent threat actors.\nGet the Report\nRelated Articles:\nVC giant Insight Partners confirms investor data stolen in breach\nJohnson Controls starts notifying people affected by 2023 breach\nHawaiian Airlines discloses cyberattack, flights not affected\n3 key takeaways from the Scattered Spider attacks on insurance firms\nHealthcare SaaS firm says data breach impacts 5.4 million patients"
